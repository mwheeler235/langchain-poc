My name is Malcolm Hawkins and I’m a senior electrical engineering student here at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. I am truly honored to welcome President Biden to this illustrious institution. When I made the decision to attend a North Carolina A&T, I was excited for the journey to come. I looked forward to learning as much as I could so that I would excel upon graduation. After being on campus for four years, I can certainly attest to the excellent education that an HBCU provides. I’ve been taught by dedicated professors and mentored by individuals who saw my potential to positively impact this world. I’ve interned at four different companies, participated in and won a national competition and traveled abroad. This and so much more is possible by investment in HBCUs. North Carolina A&T graduates the highest number of African American engineers and they go on to have successful careers in government, industry and academia.'}, {'Time': 'Malcolm Hawkins: (00:59)', 'Speech': 'There is always a need for problem solvers who can tackle the most difficult issues, including involving the economy and HBCUs prepare students for the challenge. The key to this preparation is innovation, whether that’s through our many centers of excellence or the new Harold Martin Sr. Engineering Research & Innovation Complex, A&T students, regardless of major, graduate with the skills needed to transform their respective fields. Needless to say, as I graduate next month, I feel fully equipped with the knowledge I need to excel in all aspects of my life. I’m excited to see HBCUs continue to rise in prominence, and I can’t wait to see how they impact America in the future. With that, please give a warm welcome to the president of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:05)', 'Speech': 'Hello, hello, hello Greensboro. Chancellor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:11)', 'Speech': 'Please take a seat if you have one. I said that one day, “Take a seat,” the press pointed out to me there were no chairs out there. Thank you very, very much for the opportunity to be here. Chancellor, thank you and thank your wife as well for all you do for educating the future of this country. And I’ve been impressed. I’ve been on a lot of university campuses. Matter of fact, for four years, I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and this is really an impressive place and a lot of impressive students. And it’s good to be here at A&T and I thank you for sharing your story, Malcolm. He’s going to… Did you say where you’re going? Am I allowed to say where you’re going to be working?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:54)', 'Speech': 'He’s going to work at IBM, a little outfit that does… Just remember when you’re chairman of the board remember me. Okay. If I go by and say, “Hey, Malcolm…” And I said, “Is Joe here?” I don’t want to hear “Joe who?” Okay? Well, Mayor Vaughn thank you for the passport into the city. It’s great to be here with a Congresswoman who delivers to the people of this district. Kathy, you do an incredible job. No, you really do. You really do. My dear friend, Congresswoman G.K. Butterfield, is here? There you go, man. Stand up. I want you to stand up. This guy… He’s done so much over his distinguished career for the last 20 years or so. I wish you weren’t leaving pal. I wish you weren’t leaving, but I understand. But thank for all you’ve done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:55)', 'Speech': 'And Congresswoman Alba, excuse me, Alma Adams, where’s she? There you are. I see the hat. What am I talking about? Alma, how are you? You’re the best. Thank you for all the hard work delivered for HBCUs, not just this one, but all across the country. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you’re outstanding governor, one of the best governors in the entire United States America, I say that without reservation, Governor Roy Cooper. Gov. Roy has proved himself to be not a joke, one of the finest governors in the nation. He’s displayed so many talents. He’s deployed funding for American rescue plan to delivered debt free community college for young people in North Carolina. He’s delivered high speed internet in rural communities. He’s delivered well deserved raises for teachers and first responders. And thanks for making a difference for the families here in North Carolina, governor, you are setting an example over across the country. Thank you. And look, you can cheer, it’s all right. There’s a debate in my administration that we never seem to be able to settle and that is that the vice president is incredibly talented. She’s a Howard graduate, a great school. And I hear about Morehouse men from my senior advisor, Cedric Richmond, all the time. And you got a great university here. But Delaware State. Delaware State.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:34)', 'Speech': 'They launched me into my career, not a joke. As I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old, chancellor, had to wait 17 days to be eligible to be sworn in, true story. And it wouldn’t have happened. And I won by a rousing 3021 votes. And it wouldn’t have happened without Delaware State. Most people don’t realize is Delaware has the eighth largest black population in America. And the fact is that’s, as I say in Claymont, Delaware where I was raised, a little steel town in Delaware, you all brung me to the dance. But here’s the deal, I got a member of my cabinet who also slightly partial in North Carolina A&T, Administrator for Environmental Protection Agency, Michael Regan. Michael.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:29)', 'Speech': 'Course you never hear Michael bragging about the place as long as you don’t have your hearing aid on. But look, he’s a proud Aggie and welcome back to the campus, Michael. And let me tell you, talking about some incredible students here today, I know why Michael’s so proud of this school. I really mean it. And A&A is an extraordinary, extraordinary university with a great tradition, an HBCU tradition in all more than 180 years of excellence delivering on that sacred promise we made in America, that every American, from every race, every background, every zip code should have, should have a fair and equal chance to go as far as their God-given talents can take them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:19)', 'Speech': 'And you’re providing that here, chancellor, because there’s so many, so many great professors here and the program here is so strong. You’re giving people an opportunity to take advantage of their God-given talents. That’s why I reestablished the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, with not one, but two North Carolina A&T alums on it. Willie Deese and Janeen Uzzell. Are you here? Are they here? Stand up Willie. Stand up Janeen. Thank you. And also a proud North Carolina native, an NBA star, Chris Paul. He’s on it. By the way, he’s a hell of ball player who supports the business course here at A&T and is a fierce champion for all HBCUs. That’s why I signed an executive order to advance HBCU excellence across the entire administration, everything from policies to funding. And speaking of funding, we were able to deliver more than $5 billion last year to HBCUs and more to come this year. $5 billion. And they said we couldn’t do it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:44)', 'Speech': 'But everybody’s realized what an incredible asset the HBCUs are. We’re also working to increase Pell grants to help millions of black students and lower income families attend community colleges and four year schools. The reason my wife is not with me today, she’s a community college professor and she’s teaching as we speak. And I’m here today to talk about my plan to create and expand HBCU programs in high demand fields like cyber security, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, and so much more. And to talk about why it’s so critical that we have to invest in American manufacturing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:20)', 'Speech': 'And if my dad were watching now, he passed away but watching, he’d be mad at me and say, “Excuse my back. I didn’t apologize for having my back to you. I apologize.” But excuse my back, but I’m looking at you. Why it’s essential that the Congress take action quickly to support American innovation. I said today when we were at the cybersecurity unit that more is going to change in the next 10 years than has changed in the last 50 years. Science and technology’s moving so incredibly rapidly. It’s all part of a broader vision that Vice President Harris and I ran on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:03)', 'Speech': 'It’s all part of a broader vision that Vice President Harris and I ran on, to build back a better America than even before the pandemic. A better way with better pay, greater dignity for working people, easing the financial burdens of millions of families, and making it in America. As your Congresswoman said, with America manufacturing, the best engineers in the world, like so many here at AET graduates, make up that cadre. From day one, every action I’ve taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle: Made in America. It means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America. It means bring manufacturing jobs back and building the supply chains here at home, not outsourced from abroad. It means betting on American workers, let them do the job and bet on them. It takes a federal government that doesn’t just give lip service to buy an American, but actually takes action. Most people don’t know. I know the Congresswoman knows. There’s been a law in the book since the late ’30s that says that you can use American tax dollars, and if your American tax dollars the president is spending, it should be spent on American products and American businesses. Every administration says they’ll do it since the late ’30s. But now, over time, Buy American has become basically a hollow promise. My administration is making Buy American a reality. We created Made in America in an office in the White House, a Made in America office to oversee these efforts. What’s happened is that the exception used to be, if the president spends about $600 to $700 billion of your money on federal projects every year from decks of aircraft carriers to so much more, and he’s supposed to buy American businesses, American products. But the fact of the matter is that there was an exception.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:02)', 'Speech': 'If you couldn’t readily find an American institution, either had part of the supply chain and/or the company, you didn’t have to. You could buy it abroad. You could import it. Well, last month, I announced one of the biggest changes in the Buy American act in seven years. Each year, the federal government spends more than $600 billion on goods and services. In the past, if the manufacturing product that you get purchased by the federal government says it is made substantially all in America, it worked. But because of loopholes over time, you know what substantially all meant when I took office? It meant a 55% of the product was made up of American business and American product. It was substantially all an American product. Well, guess what? To me, 55% isn’t substantially all. It’s slightly over half. We issued a rule, raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered “made in America” from 55% to 75%. Substantially all is going to start meaning substantially all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:06)', 'Speech': 'That’s good for American workers and for American businesses, and for communities like Greensboro. I want to thank Congresswoman Manning who’s been the strong, strong supporter of Buy American. Now we’re seeing the results of our economic vision. Our economy created 431,000 jobs in the month of March alone. 431,000. 7.9 million jobs over the course of my presidency. More jobs in the 14 months I’ve been president than any president ever created in American history. Unemployment at 3.6% is down from 6.4% when we took office 14 months ago. It’s the fastest decline in unemployment to start a president’s terms ever recorded. North Carolina, thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the leadership of Governor Cooper has the added 194,000 jobs in the last 14 months. 194,000 jobs. Good job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:12)', 'Speech': 'At 67,000 jobs ahead of where the state was before the pandemic hit. Unlike the past recoveries, this time around with the American Rescue Plan, we made a choice to bring everyone along. Not only has unemployment rate dropped at a record pace here in North Carolina and across the nation, but black unemployment fell by more than 30%. More than 30%. Hispanic unemployment fell from nearly 9% to 4.2% in the year 2021, the fastest single drop ever recorded. We had the largest one year drop in long term unemployment ever recorded in American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:57)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks. Of the child taxer, we’ve seen the lowest child poverty rate ever projected, an estimated nearly 40% declined in child poverty, the lowest number of home foreclosures ever recorded, a record low credit card delinquencies because families have more money in their pockets to pay their bills, the list goes on. All told, this economy grew by 5.7% last year in 2021, the fastest growth in 40 years. In the process, doing all this, we still cut the deficit last year by $350 billion, just last year alone, and by an additional $1 trillion this year, if the budget goes through. Folks, don’t tell this trickle down idea is the only way to grow an economy. We’re actually lowering the deficit, not increasing it. After a long, tough stretch, Americans are back to work. Our economy’s gone from being on the mend to being on the move.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:04)', 'Speech': 'Now, I know that we’re still facing challenges of high prices, inflation. I grew up in a family where when the price of gasoline went up at the pump, it was a conversation at the kitchen table with my dad. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. Ukraine and Russia are the one and two largest wheat producers in the world. We’re number three. They’re shut down. We saw that in yesterday’s inflation data. What people don’t know is that 70% of the increase in inflation was the consequence of Putin’s price hike because of the impact on oil prices, 70%. We need to address these high prices, and urgently, for working folks out there. That’s part of why what I’m going to talk to you about today, why it’s so important. When we build more in America, we increase economic capacity, and ultimately it helps lower everyday prices for families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:10)', 'Speech': 'That’s what we’re starting to see. Look around. American manufacturing is coming back. Once again, we’re seeing the pride that comes from stamping a product, “Made in America.” Companies are choosing to build their new factories here in America, when just a few years ago, as you all know, that wouldn’t have been the case. They would’ve built a factory overseas. Intel. The chairman of the board of Intel asked to come and see me a little over a month ago. He’s building a semiconductor mega-site just outside of [inaudible 00:17:44], investing $20 billion. By the way, we invented this little thing we call about the size of the fingertip. Guess what? Every advancement is because of us. We don’t make them anymore here. You go to Taiwan and other places to get it. Up to eight state of the art factories are going to be in one place that Intel is building. 7,000 new jobs building the facility, and 3,000 jobs running the facility. You know what the average salary of these jobs running the facility will be? $135,000 a year. Making computer chips the size of a fingertip that power of the world and our everyday lives. Smartphones, internet, technology that doesn’t even exist today. If Congress passes the Bipartisan Innovation Act that the Congresswoman talked about, and puts it on my desk right now, Intel is ready and they’ve committed to add, in addition to the $20 billion, $100 billion more. $ 120 billion in one site. That’s just the start in Intel and alone. We’re seeing it right here, thanks to the leadership of Governor Cooper and Congresswoman Manning. In last year’s, Thomas Built Buses at High Point, which I went down to see, it’s incredible. What you all are doing is really incredible. They got the largest order to date in North America to build electric school buses, electric school bus fleets, which Administrator Reagan can tell you will mean hundreds of thousands of our children will no longer be inhaling exhaust from diesel school buses. They function in their role. Volvo trucks with the research and development headquarters here in Greensboro got the largest commercial order ever for electric trucks. Just a few months, Toyota announced will invest $1.3 bill-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:03)', 'Speech': 'Just a few months ago, Toyota announced will invest 1.3 billion dollars to build a new electric battery manufacturing plant right here in Greensboro. In Greensboro. And folks, you know what that also means? Not just the factory, but the IBW is going to be putting in 530,000 charging stations throughout America. 530,000. And when this plant comes online, it’s going to produce enough batteries to power 800,000 vehicles per year, with room to grow. It’s going to create 1,750 good paying jobs, right here in the Greensboro community.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:47)', 'Speech': 'And folks… And by the way, you know, it’s not just… There’s a lot else happening, if I can divert just a second here. I had a Mary Barrow, the chairman of the board of General Motors. Remember when about 10 months ago, she was suing the state of California for having a higher standard required for gasoline; have to go more miles per gallon? She was suing them saying, ‘You can’t do what the federal government hadn’t done.” Well, guess what? We had a long talk. Now I didn’t… I mean, it was her idea, not mine. But we had a long talk. Guess what? She decided not only did she drop the suit, but they’re going to have 50% of all the vehicles made to General Motors electric vehicles by the year 2030. And guess what? Then Ford came along. Ford came along. They did the same thing. They’re investing billions of dollars, 1.7… I mean, this is a major fundamental shift that’s taking place. And America’s finally deciding to catch up and lead it, instead of being outpaced by China and other countries. All told, thus far we’ve created 365,000 new manufacturing job in America just last year. That’s the best year for US manufacturing in the last 30 years. And even you students who are younger, how many when you were coming up and you hear your parents talk about, “Manufacturing is dead in America? Not going to happen in America.” There’s not a thing, not a single thing, America cannot do. Not a single thing where we can’t out compete the rest of the world. I mean it. Not a single thing. We set our mind to it. Good paying jobs. Jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs that can’t be outsourced.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:44)', 'Speech': '[Inaudible 00:22:44] like these don’t happen in the vacuum. That require investments. We know what happens when we stop in investing in the future, and the places like Greensboro. We really do. You or your parents remember what it felt like when industries like the textile industry started to decline. Delaware used to be a great textile state. It all evaporated. Good jobs lost over time. Well, guess what. What it did the families, what did to neighborhoods, was consequential. Because we stopped investing in our future for a while. We stopped investing in our people. I got criticized when I kept saying, “We’re going to invest in the American people.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:29)', 'Speech': 'Decades ago, we used to invest 2% of our gross domestic product in research and development. 2%. And we led the world. Today, we invest less than 1%. The United States of America used to be ranked number one in the world, in investing in the future. Now we’re ranked number nine. Number nine in research and development. The United States of America. China was number eight three decades ago. Now it’s number two. Other countries are closing in fast. We can, and we must change that. Not by hurting other countries, but by developing ourselves. We have a great opportunity ahead of us, with the bipartisan innovation act I mentioned. Which is going to provide 90 billion dollars in research and development. STEM education, manufacturing, all those elements of the supply chain that we need to produce and products right here in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:36)', 'Speech': 'If I told those of you who are closer to my age in the audience, if we told your parents that we’d be here, they’d look at like were crazy. “What do you mean? We’re the leader in the world.” Not so. Congress needs to get this bill to my desk as quickly as possible. Our economic strength is on the line, and national security as well is on the line. Companies are ready to invest in America, and American communities, and American workers. But they need to see that their government is capable of investing in our future. Other countries are racing ahead, but we can’t afford to wait. So Congress, get this bipartisan bill to my desk. North Carolina needs it, american needs it, and let’s meet this moment together. That’s exactly what we did when we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which you lurk like the devil on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:33)', 'Speech': 'Our infrastructure used to be rated the best in the world, again. Now we rank number 13 in the world. Bridges, roads, et cetera. Rank 13. Why do we develop so fast, so well? Where are you going to build your factory? Near a port that can get everything out of that you manufacture? And get everything out to the rest of the world quickly? Or something that takes two weeks, or three weeks to get it there. It’s all about speed. We can’t compete for the jobs in the 21st century if we don’t fix our infrastructure. But now, thanks to the infrastructure law, we’re turning things around in a major way. We’ve already announced billions to improve the more than thousand airports in the 50 states that need serious help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:24)', 'Speech': 'Digress again for just a second. I was out, when I was Vice President, at O’Hare airport. And I was trying to get onto the Air Force Two and going up an escalator. And had a sign at the top, “Out of order. Will be fixed in two weeks.” Not a joke. The United States of America, on the busiest airports in the world, “Fixed in two weeks.” And I got in trouble because I said if I took you into O’Hare airport blindfolded in the middle of the night, and took you into one of China’s airports blindfolded in the middle of the night and said, “Where are you? China or the United States? You’d probably think the Chinese airport was ours. Because it’s so modern. So different.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:12)', 'Speech': 'Well this year, 92 million dollars is available to North Carolina alone to upgrade your airport infrastructure. 92 million dollars. We’re modernizing highways, roads, bridges, courts. And this year, North Carolina is going to receive… This year. 1.4 billion dollars in funding for roads and bridges. Another 99 billion dedicated to funding for bridges that are in disrepair. Folks… We’re also building a national network of electric charging stations I mentioned earlier, for vehicles powered by these batteries and are going to manufacture here in Greensboro. And this year North Carolina [inaudible 00:28:02] will receive nearly 16 million in electric charging stations. We’re also getting rid of poisonous lead pipes that are in 10 million homes in America, and 400,000 schools and daycare centers. And do serious brain damage. Not a joke. So kids and families can have clean drinking water. And this year, North Carolina received 199 million dollars for clean water. Because of that man right there, the governor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (28:36)', 'Speech': 'And folks, we’re going to deliver affordable high speed internet everywhere in urban America, and rural America, suburban and tribal communities. So moms don’t have to do this. I wonder if you ever thought this would happen in America. Remember two, three months ago, when schools were still shut down? Showing pictures of moms and dads driving to the parking lot of a McDonald’s so they could connect the internet, so the kid could do their homework? Not a joke. Not a joke. What the hell’s going on here?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:17)', 'Speech': 'All these investments, infrastructure, research and development, and making it in America, are really about one thing: empowering more communities to do what you’re doing here in Greensboro. Transforming yourself into a city. City of the future, not the past. Where, instead of shuttered fact trees, we’re building clean energy technology that’s going to power the future, in America and around the world. Helping America achieve true energy independence by creating good jobs and fighting for climate change. And if we continue this, we’re not only going to be investing here, we’re going to export billions of dollars worth of product for the rest of the world. One of the proposals I have I won’t go into now is a Build Back Better…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (30:03)', 'Speech': 'One of the proposals I have, that we’ll go into now, is a build back better world, so all those countries in Africa, and Latin America, and the Middle East, who don’t have the capacity to make it better for themselves. We cut down all our forests, we’re doing fine. Guess what? We’re part of the reason for the global warming. A lot of poor countries…do you realize one of the greatest carbon sinks in the world, absorbing carbon from the air, is the Amazon? The Amazon absorbs more pollutants, more carbon into the soil and the water in the Amazon, than are emitted in the entire United States in one year, every year. But they don’t have the money, what they want to do? They want to level it, so they can farm it, they can produce things on it, and use up that sink. Even reinventing the legacy industries that Greensboro has been built on is within possibility.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:02)', 'Speech': 'The 21 century smart textiles, they use chips and sensors to do things like regulate temperature in a garment. State-of-the-art facilities that make high-quality furniture. Above all, you’re making Greensboro a place where the future is being written, not a joke. The future is being written. Where students at great schools like A&T and other local universities, and your incredible community colleges, can lead learning the cutting edge skills, and state-of-the-art facilities partnering with local employers. They can get out, help America lead the way on robotics, cybersecurity, and so much more, and see that success reflected back home in their communities. Not just in Greensboro, but across the country. Families can have good paychecks, good homes, great futures. My dad was a very well-read man. His greatest regret was he never got to go to college. My dad used to say that everybody deserved just a little bit of breathing room, just a little bit of breathing room. I was raised in a three-bedroom split level home when we moved down to Delaware, when coal died in Scranton and jobs were gone, with four kids, my grand pop, and my mom and dad. I remember one day, you could always hear when dad was restless, I asked Mom on the way to school, “What’s the matter?” She said, “Honey, dad’s company, they said, no more health insurance.” It not only deprives a woman or a man of their health, but of their dignity. Look at their child, their husband, their wife who needs help, and can’t get the help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (33:08)', 'Speech': 'One of the things we’re trying to get done in the Congress is to past legislation that won’t raise taxes a single penny for anybody making less than $400,000. Above that, it’ll only be a smidget. For dealing with insulin, you’ve got 200,000 kids with type one diabetes. If they don’t get their insulin, and many of you may know somebody, or you may be have type one diabetes, you need the insulin. It costs $10 a vile to make. Average price? $646 a month. Not only imagine what happens when you don’t have that money because you don’t have the insurance or the cash, imagine being a parent, looking to your child with type one diabetes, and know there’s not a damn thing you can do. It deprives you of your dignity, takes everything away from you. Guess what? For little or nothing, we can limit that price to $35 a month, and they’ll still make 350% profit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (34:28)', 'Speech': 'That’s the story we’ve got to keep writing. By the way, I’m a capitalist. I’m not somebody doesn’t think you should be able to go to make a million or a billion dollars. Pay your fair share. Pay a little, tiny bit. Not a joke. Of the Fortune 500 companies, and I come from the corporate capital of the world, not a joke. More companies are incorporated in the state of Delaware than in the entire United States of America combined. I was a Senator 36 years, but guess what? 55 of them last year didn’t pay a single penny in tax, and they made $40 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:15)', 'Speech': 'Folks, look, we have to keep going on so many other issues, to deliver the promise of America to all Americans. For example, equity and opportunity require more than just economic investment. They require police and criminal justice reform. Even though Congress isn’t taking action, my administration hears and sees people who need it badly. We’re making changes in the federal law. Police need more money, not less, in order to have social workers and others with them, not just to teach them how to do their job better. We need rules that I’ve initiated federally.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:56)', 'Speech': 'No more choke holds, no more no-knock warrants, requiring federal agents to wear protective body cameras. We’re going to sit back while Republicans in Congress stand in the way, stand in the way of justice? I’m sorry to be partisan about that, but they are. They’re unwilling to do anything. We’re taking action. Today, my administration has also released the first ever equity action plan, laying out more than 300 concrete commitments to tear down the systematic barriers that have been allowed to fester for far too long in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (36:29)', 'Speech': 'Things like getting pollution out of low income neighborhoods. You notice they’re always the last ever be touched. In Delaware, we have a big chemical industry. Guess what? The corridor that we run down, going down the state, the fence line communities, the cancer rate…we have one of the highest cancer rates in America. Why? Because all these poor communities live near these stations, near these places. When I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware, not a joke, we lived right on the Pennsylvania border, it was a steel town. There are more oil refineries in Marcus Oak, Pennsylvania, in the bend of Delaware River, than anywhere, including Houston.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (37:11)', 'Speech': 'Guess what? When it got to be fall, when I was in fourth grade, and there got a little frost, my mom would get in the car to drive me to school, which was only three quarters of a mile away, but it was on a highway. Turn on the windshield wiper and there’d be an oil slick on the window. That wouldn’t have happened where I live now, in a nice neighborhood, it would never happen. We’re making sure that minority owned business can access capital they need to grow, so no community is locked out of opportunity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (37:50)', 'Speech': 'I’m not saying this because I’m at an HBCU. I’ve been saying this my whole career. When I ran for office, I said, I’m sick and tired of trickle down economy. I’m about building from the middle up and out, because when the middle does well, everybody does. The poor have a way up, and the wealthy do very well. The bottom line is this: the United States is in the position to out-compete the world once again. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us, and we still face tremendous challenges. But if we can keep coming together, invest in the backbone of America, the middle class, our great universities, hardworking families, STEM education, clean technologies for tomorrow, there’s simply no limit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (38:34)', 'Speech': 'I mean it, no limit to what we can achieve. Let’s continue getting working families a fighting chance. Let’s keep investing in the future of this country, of every community. Let’s face these challenges head-on. Let’s keep building a better America, because that’s who we’ve been. That’s who we are. We can do this. Still grow the economy, still be the wealthiest nation in the world, still reduce deficits, by growing. Growing, growing, growing. There’s not a single thing America can’t do when we do it together, as the United States of America. God bless you all.'}]"

The president and I are so excited that you are here. As your first lady and as a teacher, I’ve seen again and again that learning doesn’t only happen in a classroom. There are so many fun opportunities to learn around us every day. And that’s especially true here at the White House. For generations, presidents and first ladies and kids just like you celebrated the Easter Egg Roll together, racing and making crafts, reading books and of course meeting the Easter Bunny. Education never stops. The determined spirit of education is we wanted to honor in this Easter Egg Roll. So we turned the south lawn into a school community. Today, we hope you learn by going to the reading nook, roll some eggs, and most of all have fun. Welcome to your house, the people’s house. Happy Easter. Now, please welcome my husband, our president, Joe Biden. Sorry.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:37)', 'Speech': 'My job is to keep it from raining for another two minutes. Jill and I are excited to have you at the White House. We weren’t able to host this Easter Egg Roll last year because of the pandemic. But this year, we’re finally getting together again. And it’s so special. It means so much to see and hear the children and all the families show up to be here today. The joy, the laughter and the occasional, at least with my young grandson told me too, the occasional, “There’s the Easter bunny.” Little startled sometimes. But the joy and the laughter is something that has been a wonderful tradition here at the White House for a long, long time. I especially want to thank the White House Historical Association, the National Park Service and America’s Egg Board for all our hard work to make this day possible. Let’s give them a round of applause. All you have fun today. Welcome to the White House. Welcome to your house. Welcome to the South Lawn. Thank you and happy, happy Easter.'}]"

My name is Deaglan McEachern and as… It’s a tough one. You can always call me Mr. Mayor here in Portsmouth. But as mayor of Portsmouth, it’s my incredible honor to welcome all of you and the president of the United States, Joe Biden to Portsmouth. Now I think it’s fitting that we’re talking about infrastructure here in Portsmouth, the City of the Open Door. Our door only stays open if we invest in our future. Investments in this port are going to make it so that heating oil, salt, everything that you touch is able to come in more efficiently, and that means for less money in your pocketbooks. But not only is this an economic boom for the city of Portsmouth in the state of New Hampshire, this is also about our national security.'}, {'Time': 'Deaglan McEachern: (01:03)', 'Speech': 'If you ever get cornered by Geno Marconi, he’s going to tell you exactly how much help we deliver to the Navy yard in terms of all the work that they do on behalf of our country. And they have a lot of work to do. They’re building dry docks. And as it was explained to me, one inch of water above the dry docks means the entire Atlantic ocean is in those dry docks. So we’re very proud of that. And we know that this could not have happened, this infrastructure, this bipartisan infrastructure without our congressional delegation. Thank you, Senator Hassan. Thank you, Congressman Chris Pappas. Thank you, Congressman Annie Kuster. Thank you, Jeanne Shaheen. We appreciate that. And it is now an honor of a lifetime to welcome here to stage President of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:18)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Please, take a seat if you have one. I once, several years ago, said, “Everybody take a seat.” It was an evening, there were about 2000 people out in a football field and it was toward the end of a campaign. I said, “Have a seat.” And they all looked at me like, “We’re standing,” all of them. I couldn’t see. But anyway, thank you very much. Look, it’s great to be here in Portsmouth with your senator, Maggie Hassan, who’s been one of my friends for a long time, and to talk about investments we’re making to modernize this port and create jobs and bring down the cost for families in the region of everyday life. Maggie was a key player in the Infrastructure Law. And it’s making a difference here in New Hampshire and I might add around the country. She made the case for high speed internet everywhere in New Hampshire and protecting New Hampshire’s coastlines from rising sea levels and extreme storms, and for the investments in New Hampshire’s roads and bridges, ports and waterways.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:26)', 'Speech': 'And Representative Chris Pappas, thank you for a passport into your district. Chris, where are you? Is Chris over here? Well, thanks for the passport, old buddy, into the district. I appreciate it. And he’s a member of the committee that got this bill across the finish line. Getting big ideas in an actual bill is hard work, requiring getting into the real nitty-gritty details and without losing the big picture. I agree. I agree completely. By the way, kids are allowed to do anything they want when I speak at all. So don’t worry about it. And but Chris, thank you for all the work you did. And you did a hell of a lot of work to get this done, and always making the economic case for how clean water, access to the internet, rebuilding a bridge, investing in this port matters to your lives, the lives of your families, and quite frankly, to the entire region.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:17)', 'Speech': 'And Representative Annie Kuster, an old good friend of mine. It’s good to see you as well, Annie. Thank you for everything. Annie and I have talked a lot about what we need to do to support New Hampshire’s parents and give them just a little bit of breathing room because sometimes things get tight. And even though she can’t be here, I also wanted to recognize Jeanne Shaheen, who is well represented today by her husband, Billy and the family. Billy, where are you? If I can only have one guy in the foxhole with me, I’d pick Billy. Good to see you, Billy. And I want to thank, because she’s sitting next to him. She doesn’t hold any office but a really good friend of mine. Her mom used to be a significant political figure up here. It’s great to see you, kiddo. Thank you. Thank you for being here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:12)', 'Speech': 'I also want to thank Chris and Maggie and Jeanne and Annie for all they did to prove that America can do big things when we work together. We can build a better America. We’re the only country in the world that I believe that has come out of every crisis we’ve faced stronger than when we went in, literally stronger than we went in. That’s the history of the journey of this country. And this port is a perfect example. A lot of important things come into these terminals and particularly this one, from salt to de-ice roads, to 85% of the home heating oil used in this state. And a lot of important things go out of this port as well, like the massive reactor assemblies for nuclear power plants that are manufactured by Westinghouse Electric here in New Hampshire.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:01)', 'Speech': 'Recently, this port has been an important link to more construction equipment and materials for a $2.3 billion project that I’ve authorized in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, 2.3 billion. But it wouldn’t happen without you all and what you’ve done. Now, I know they say the port’s in Maine, but I’ve always thought it was in New Hampshire. That’s what Billy taught me. And where the Navy’s nuclear-powered attack submarines are built as well and are stationed. Look, all in, this port supports over 2,300 jobs. 2,300 jobs adds $275 million to this region’s economy, and that’s not even counting the more than 6,000 civilian contractors and jobs here over at the Navy yard. Jobs in Maine, New Hampshire, and all around the region. But this port has even more potential than that. Until recently, the area in the harbor called the turning basin was only 800 feet long and often meant that pilots had to turn around a 765 foot ship in 800 feet. I call that tough parallel parking, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:23)', 'Speech': 'But seriously, and it meant that to be safe, some of the ships could only come in or sail out on high tide. They could only sail at night, or when there was… They couldn’t sail when there was too much wind. They couldn’t. And because they’d get knocked off course. And that here’s why it matters. When you keep a ship in dock after the cargo has been delivered, it can cost $90,000 a day when that ship is in port. And those costs get paid on, get passed on to you, consumers, whatever it happens to be. It also has been a problem for decades. But with an $18 million investment from the Army Corps of Engineers and the help of Maggie and Chris, the port and union labor, we widened that turning basin to 1200 feet. We got it done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:15)', 'Speech': 'Now it’s easier, faster, and cheaper, and safer for ships to get in and out. And the port can welcome larger ships, more cargo, like the massive towers and hubs needed to for offshore wind farms. Look, we’ve also announced an additional $1.7 million investment to dredge, another tricky part of a shipping channel where the sands build up. Without that dredging product, the port might need more restrictions on what ships can and can’t pass through this harbor. Instead of turning away business, we’re sending a message: This port is open for business and will be for a long time. And we’re sending the same message with our investments in roads and bridges here in New Hampshire. Back in November, Maggie, Chris and Annie were with me when I visited Pemi, the Pemi bridge in Woodstock, a couple of hours just northwest of here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:09)', 'Speech': 'The bridge opened in 1939. Not a big bridge, but it solved big problems. Local businesses depended on it. School buses crossed it every day. Without the bridge, the trucks on the other side of the river would have to take a 10 mile detour to get around to the other side of the river. Folks, when fires and emergencies, every single mile matters and counts how long it takes to get there. Right now, there are nearly 200 bridges deemed deficient in New Hampshire alone. There’s about 315 such bridges in Maine. And many of these are fast-track, less-traffic bridges that are essential to small towns and rural areas for farmers and small business. Let me give you an example. I was just in Pittsburgh not long ago, I guess over a little over a month ago. And I got there the morning that one of its bridges collapsed. The bridge was built in 1939, if I’m not mistaken, and had been put on a list of being dangerous.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:12)', 'Speech': 'It was about a 12-story drop from the middle of that bridge down to a small creek. And it was in a… But it was a ravine that covered about 300 yards. Had it not been a snow day before, there would have been a lot of school buses on that bridge. A lot of kids would have been killed. I’m not joking. You probably saw it on the front page of every paper in America. Well, guess what? It’s happening all over the country. Fortunately, it didn’t happen there. Fortunately, there was no one on the bridge. Actually, there were four vehicles. No one got killed. And when I was doing the Recovery Act in our last administration, Obama-Biden, I was in Pittsburgh. Excuse me, in Pennsylvania, in Western Pennsylvania, a small town. And in the process, I looked at a bridge, and they couldn’t… Their fire department was on one side of the bridge. And literally from here to that holding tank outside here was the other side, there was a shopping center and a school.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:17)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? Their fire, you couldn’t get across the bridge. You had to go 10 miles to get around, go up over the bridge, that could work and get back down. People dying in that 10 miles of a fire truck getting there in the middle of a fire. This matters. So we’re making historic investments in fixing these bridges. This year alone, we’re delivering $45 million to fix your bridges here in New Hampshire. This year alone. The last fella who had this job kept talking about infrastructure week for four years. Well, we not only took infrastructure, we have infrastructure decade. This is going on. It’s a billion 200 million dollars. We used to have the finest infrastructure in the world. We now rank number 13 in the quality of our infrastructure. China is ahead of us. So many other countries have moved.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:23)', 'Speech': 'Folks, this matters. It matters to our safety, our security, our health, and a whole range of… Not only that, about 700 miles of highway in New Hampshire are in poor condition. It’s estimated that the driving on those roads, those 700 miles, roughly 700 miles, that need repairs costs New Hampshire drivers at least an average of $476 a year extra in gas and repairs and longer commute times. That’s a $476 hidden tax on New Hampshire drivers. Look, thanks to the Infrastructure Law, we’re making the most significant investment in modernizing our roads and bridges since the Interstate Highway System was built with Eisenhower. We’re also going to start to replace the 100%, all 100% of lead water pipes and service lines going into our homes and our schools.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:15)', 'Speech': 'There are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and preschools and daycare centers that have lead water pipes bringing the water in. Many of that causes mental illness, brain damage. It’s really important. We’re also going to address what they call PFAS, it’s a dangerous forever chemicals that are a threat to drinking water here in New Hampshire and other states, something that Senator Shaheen has championed. Look, every American and every child should be able to turn on a faucet, drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good paying jobs for plumbers, pipe fitters, and the folks digging those channels. And by the way, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, New Hampshire is already seeing $150 million being put into drinking water, wastewater, and storm sewer projects in this state as I speak.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:16)', 'Speech': 'Maggie, Chris and Annie, we share a core belief: High speed internet is essential, essential to success in the 21st century. But even today, one in every 10 people in New Hampshire, every one in 10 households don’t have high speed internet. That’s a lot of places where there’s no broadband or infrastructure at all in New Hampshire. It’s not just New Hampshire families, but for New Hampshire businesses as well. This law is going to make high speed internet affordable and available everywhere in New Hampshire, Maine, and the region, urban, suburban, rural. It’s going to create jobs. Thousands of union technicians are going to be laying down these broadband lines. And never again should a parent have to sit in their car in a McDonald’s parking lot, literally, so that their child can get access to high speed internet to do their homework over the internet, literally. Folks, look, the law also builds up our resilience to extreme weather.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:24)', 'Speech': '15 years ago this week, this state experienced it’s second 100 year flood in the space of 11 months. Cars submerged. Thousands of evacuations. People lost everything they owned twice. Our Infrastructure Law upgrades stormwater management systems, builds new transmission lines and towers so fewer will be flooded out in their homes or lose power in days and weeks because of these storms. There’s so much more in this law. I’m not going to bore you with the rest of it, but it’s significant. Look, we’ve made a lot of progress, and we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us. But we know what families are still struggling with higher prices. I grew up in a family where the price of gasoline went up at the pump, it was a discussion at the kitchen table. Because my dad, he was a good man, made a decent living, but always on the margins. Everything mattered.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:20)', 'Speech': 'So let’s be absolutely clear about why we have such high prices now. There are two reasons. First was COVID. The way the global economy works, if a factory in Vietnam makes computer chips and shuts down in Vietnam because of a COVID outbreak, it causes a ripple effect to slow down manufacturing in Detroit where they need those semiconductors to build the automobiles. So because of the pandemic, we had disruptions in our supply of important materials, so prices went up. As I said, just look at automobiles. Last year alone, they accounted for one-third of all the inflation in America because the price went up, because so fewer being made. Automobile companies couldn’t get the computer chips, and the price of automobiles skyrocket. So I’m calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan Innovation Bill to make more of these chips here at home and speed the supply.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:18)', 'Speech': 'Intel came to see me, the chairman of the board of Intel. He said, “I want to be able to invest $20 billion to build a computer chip factories in just west of Cleveland.” If in fact, we get this other piece of legislation, which is in passed one House and not the other, we’re going to, he’s going to invest another $100 billion. You know what the average job, there’s over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,800 full-time jobs. Average salary of the full-time jobs, and many of them are blue-collar jobs, are $126,000 a year. Things are changing. And the second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin. Not a joke. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. Two major breadbaskets of wheat in the world were Ukraine and Russia. The United States is number three and Canada number four. Well, we saw the most recent inflation data.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:25)', 'Speech': 'Last month, about 70% of the increase in inflation was a consequence of Putin’s price hike because the impact on gas and energy prices. I’m doing everything I can to bring down the price to address Putin’s price hike. That’s why I authorized the release of one million barrels per day for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And I know the press is always asking me with good reason why I’m always on the phone talking with other world leaders, trying to keep them organized. Well, one of the things I did, I went out and got a lot of other countries to agree that they would release petroleum from their oil reserves. So we worked with the US oil producers to ramp up the production and we coordinated this release with our partners and allies around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:12)', 'Speech': 'And shortly after I made the announcement, another 30 countries agreed to 60 million additional barrels a day on the market. So now we have 240 million barrels a day for the next six months. That’s the largest collective reserve release in history. Nations coming together to help deny Putin the ability to weaponize energy resources against American families and families in Europe and around the world. But there’s more that need to be done. And Americans should already be seeing the savings. Although it’s only gone down about 18 cents, the savings are starting. Beyond gas prices, I’ve called on Congress to move immediately to lower the cost of family utility bills, prescription drug bills, and more, while lowering the deficit and reducing inflation. That would make a big difference for families. We can do a lot of these things without raising a single penny on taxes of anyone making less than $400,000 a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:07)', 'Speech': 'Nobody making less than $400,000 will see a single penny in their taxes raised. It’s the best way Congress can address inflation right now. And folks, look, the fact is that we are in a situation where the war in Ukraine is going to continue to take its toll on the world economy. It’s going to take its toll on energy, and it’s going to take its toll relative to food. When I was running for office, you heard it a thousand times from me, that we’re going to build an economy around you. I’m so tired of trickle-down economics. And I never found that trickle down on top of my head very much. I was listed. I had the great pleasure of being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. I still had making a hell of a lot more money anybody else because I was getting a senator’s salary. No kidding.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:06)', 'Speech': 'I didn’t think you should make money while you’re in office. But anyway, the point of it is this: A awful lot of people are hurting. It makes a big difference. It makes a big difference. The cost of a dozen eggs, cost of a gallon of gasoline, it matters. It matters. So I concluded when I ran this last time that we’re going to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, because when that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well and the poor have a ladder up, and the middle class has a little bit of breathing room. I grew up in a household where we lived in a split-level home, three bedrooms, four kids, mom and dad, and a grandpop who lived with us. And I remember one night, you could, the walls were kind of thin. My dad was restless. Next morning, when he went to work, I asked mom what was the problem. She said, “He just noticed his company just said no more, they’re not going to cover health insurance anymore.” It matters. These things matter to people. They matter to ordinary people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:15)', 'Speech': 'We can, in fact, provide for anyone who has Type I diabetes or a child, or 200 million, 200,000 kids who have it. They need that insulin every single day. Average cost is $647 a month, sometimes as low as 90 and as high as 1000, depending where you are. You know how much it costs to make one of those vials of insulin? 10, T-E-N dollars. Not a single change has been made in that insulin since it was first discovered. And so we can set that price at maximum of $35. They still make a significant profit. And what in God’s name are we doing? Look, I’m a capitalist. I think people should be able to go out and make millions of dollars, even a billion if you can make it, but at least pay your fair share. Pay something. Pay something.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:15)', 'Speech': 'By the way, I’m being deadly earnest. I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than every other state in the nation combined. And I survived winning seven Senate elections in that state. But here’s the deal. The fact is, folks, that there are 50 Fortune, there are 50 of the top 500 corporations in America last year that made a total of $40 billion in profit. They didn’t pay one single penny, not one. The average percent that billionaires pay of the 790 of them is about 3.8%. Just pay your fair share. We can do all these things. And by the way, one last thing. The budget I submitted, my first budget that passed and became law, it cut the federal deficit by $350 billion. We cut the deficit $350 billion. And the budget I proposed this year, if it comes through total fruition, will cut the deficit by one trillion three hundred billion dollars.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:56)', 'Speech': 'So when my Republican friends start talking about big spenders and the reason why there’s inflation, take a look, we’ve cut the deficit drastically. So look, we’re making progress. Over the course of my presidency, our recovery so far has created 7.9 million new jobs, more jobs created over the first 14 months than any president ever. Over 420,000 manufacturing jobs. Unemployment rate is at 3.6% down from 6.4%. In the state of New Hampshire, you’re down from, I think it’s 4.2% to 3.2%. Folks, in Maine you’ve added 28,000 jobs, and unemployment has dropped from four, four to three, six. New Hampshire, 26,000 new jobs. Dropped from four, two, I was misspoke, to two, five, 2.5%. Last year, as I said, we cut the deficit by more than $350 billion. This year, we’re on track for 1.3 trillion cuts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:08)', 'Speech': 'And look, that’d be the largest debt reduction in American history. And it’s particularly important now we ask ourselves: How are we going to reduce pressure on inflation? Maine, New Hampshire, America have gone on the mend. They’re not on the mend any longer. They’re on the move. And we’re coming at our challenges from position of strength. But I’m more optimistic about America today than ever been in my whole career, because I see the future that’s within our grasp. We can’t be afraid though. We’re the only nation on earth, as I said, that’s always turned every single solitary crisis we’ve had into an opportunity. That’s exactly what we’re going to do today if we do it together. It’s about being together, the United States of America. When we do that, there’s not a single thing we can’t do. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

Sorry to keep you waiting a little bit. I and the honor of spending some time with the Ukrainian prime minister who’s in town today, and he is meeting with some of my cabinet members, including the secretary of treasury and others. And we had a good discussion. I’ve talked about what I’m about to tell you about today, as well as he was thanking the American people for their support, understands it’s significant, and we talked about keeping everyone together in terms of Europe, European Union, and others in the effort to stop Putin’s brutality.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:41)', 'Speech': 'But before I head out to the West Coast, I want to quickly update at the American people on the latest steps we’re taking to support the people of Ukraine and to hold Putin accountable for is brutal and bloody war.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:54)', 'Speech': 'Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv, leaving behind them a horrifying evidence, and you’ve seen it, you reported it, and your folks… And by the way, I don’t say this often, but I think we should give enormous credit to the folks with your agencies that are on the ground in Ukraine, in these spots, and they’re really… I’ve spoken to several of them, we owe them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:19)', 'Speech': 'But uncovering these evidences of their atrocities and war crimes against Ukraine and people, it’s so clear to the whole world now. Now they’ve launched and refocused their campaign to seize new territory in Eastern Ukraine. And we’re in a critical window now, of time, where that they’re going to set the stage for the next phase of this war. And the United States and our allies and partners are moving as fast as possible to continue to provide Ukraine the forces that they need, the weapons they need, excuse me, the equipment they need, their forces need to defend their nation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:52)', 'Speech': 'Last week, I signed an $800 million package of security assistance to Ukraine that included new capabilities like artillery systems and armored personnel carriers, equipment that is responsive to Ukraine’s needs and tailored to support the intensified fighting in the Donbas region, which is a different war than in other places, because both topographically it’s different, it’s flat, it’s not in the mountains, and it requires different kinds of weapons to be more effective.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:21)', 'Speech': 'Today I’m announcing another $800 million to further augment Ukraine’s ability to fight in the East, in the Donbas Region. This package includes heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with those howitzers. It also includes more tactical drones.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:41)', 'Speech': 'In the past two months we’ve moved weapons and equipment to Ukraine at record speed. We’ve sent thousands of anti-armor and anti-missile helicopters, drones, grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles, radar systems, more than 50 million rounds of ammunition had already been sent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:57)', 'Speech': 'The United States alone has provided 10 anti-armor systems for every one Russian tank that’s in Ukraine, a 10-to-one ratio. We’re sharing and will continue to share significant timely intelligence with Ukraine to help defend them against Russian aggression. And on top of this, these direct contributions from the United States, we’re facilitating, we’re the outfit facilitating the significant flow of weapons and systems to Ukraine from other allies and partners around the world, like the S-300 long range anti-aircraft systems that Slovakia recently transferred to Ukraine. We are getting them in there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:36)', 'Speech': 'We won’t always be able to advertise everything that our partners are doing to support Ukraine and its fight for freedom, but to modernize Teddy Roosevelt’s famous advice, sometimes we will speak softly and carry a large Javelin, because we’re sending a lot of those in as well, but we’re not sitting on the funding that Congress has provided for Ukraine. We’re sending it directly to the front lines of freedom, to the fearless and skilled Ukrainian fighters who are standing in the breach.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:06)', 'Speech': 'You got to admit, you must be amazed at the courage of this country, the resolve that they’re showing, not just their military, but the average citizen, men and women, young men, young women as well. The sustained and coordinated support of the international community led and facilitated by the United States is a significant reason why Ukraine is able to [inaudible 00:06:33]. Every American taxpayer, every member of our [inaudible 00:06:39] Forces can be proud of the fact that our country’s generosity and the skill and service of our military helped arm and repel Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:48)', 'Speech': 'To beat back Putin’s savagery, that tried to seize Ukraine’s capital and wipe out Ukraine’s government. The battle of Kyiv was a historic victory for the Ukrainians. It was a victory for freedom, won by the Ukrainian people with unprecedented assistance by the United States and our allies and our partners.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:06)', 'Speech': 'Now, now we have to accelerate that assistance package to help prepare Ukraine for Russia’s offensive that’s going to be more limited in terms of geography, but not in terms of brutality, not in terms of brutality.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:20)', 'Speech': 'Combined with our recent drawdowns, it will ensure a steady flow of weapons and equipment into Ukraine over the next few weeks. However, with this latest disbursement, I’ve almost exhausted the drawdown authority I have that Congress authorized for Ukraine in a bipartisan spending bill last month.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:39)', 'Speech': 'In order to sustain Ukraine for the duration of this fight, next week I’m going to have to be sending to Congress, a supplemental budget request to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters, and continue to deliver economic assistance to the Ukrainian people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:57)', 'Speech': 'And my hope is, and my expectation is Congress would move and act quickly. And I want to thank the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, for their support for the people of Ukraine. Our unity at home, our unity with our allies and partners, and our unity with the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: he will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine, that will not happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:23)', 'Speech': 'In addition to bolstering Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield, we’re also demonstrating our support for the people of Ukraine. Today, the United States is announcing that we intend to provide an additional $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian Government. This brings our total economic support for Ukraine to $1 billion in the past two months.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:45)', 'Speech': 'This is money the government can help use to stabilize their economy, to support communities that have been devastated by the Russian onslaught, and pay the brave workers that continue to provide essential services to the people of Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:59)', 'Speech': 'These past weeks have seen a terrible human cost of Putin’s ambition for conquest and control. Approximately two-thirds, two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have been displaced from their home. More than five million Ukrainians have fled their country. It’s an absolute outrage. The idea this is happening approaching the second quarter of the 21st century is just…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:26)', 'Speech': 'Last month when I was in Europe I announced that the United States would welcome 100,000 Ukrainians so that we share in the responsibility of supporting Ukrainians fleeing Putin’s war machine. We’ve already welcomed tens of thousands of Ukrainians to the United States. And today I’m announcing a program, Unite For Ukraine, a new program to enable Ukrainians seeking refuge to come directly from Europe to the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:52)', 'Speech': 'This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, including immigrant visas and refugees processing. It’ll provide an expedient channel for secure legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians who have a US sponsor, such as a family or an NGO. This program will be fast, it’ll be streamlined, and it will ensure the United States honors its commitment to go to the people of Ukraine and need not go through our southern border.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:24)', 'Speech': 'We’re also continuing to ratchet up the pressure on Putin, and further isolate Russia on the world stage. Yesterday, the Treasury Department rolled out additional measures to crack down on the entities and individuals attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions, not just ours, but throughout the West.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:43)', 'Speech': 'Today I’m announcing that the United States will ban Russian-affiliated ships from our ports, as they did in Europe. That means no ship, no ship, that sails under the Russian flag, or that is owned or operated by our Russian interests will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores, none, none.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:04)', 'Speech': 'This is yet another critical step we’re taking in concert with our partners in European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and further to deny Russia the benefits of international economic system that they so enjoyed in the past.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:17)', 'Speech': 'We don’t know how long this war will last, but as we approach the two month mark, here’s what we do know: Putin has failed to achieve his grand ambitions on the battlefield. After weeks of shelling Kyiv, Kyiv still stands. Present Zelenskyy and his democratically-elected government still remain in power. And the Ukrainian Armed Forces, joined by many brave Ukrainian civilians have thwarted Russia’s conquest of their country. They’ve been bolstered from day one by an unstinting supply of weapons, ammunition, armor, intelligence from the nations of the free world led by us, the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:56)', 'Speech': 'As Russia continues to grind out their military advances, and there are military advances and the brutalities against Ukraine, Putin is banking on us losing interest. That’s been my view, and you heard me say this from the beginning, he was counting on NATO, European Union, our allies in Asia, cracking, moving away. He’s betting on Western unity will crack. He’s still betting on that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:22)', 'Speech': 'And once again, we’re going to prove him wrong. We will not lessen our evolve. We’re going to continue to stand with the brave and proud people of Ukraine. We will never fail in our determination to defend freedom and oppose tyranny; it’s as simple as that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:38)', 'Speech': 'So again, I want to thank the American people, thank the American people for their support of the Ukrainian people. This is our responsibility it seems to me, and we’ve been able to hold the whole world together in this effort.

How significant is that?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:05)', 'Speech': 'Well, first of all, it’s questionable whether he does control Mariupol. One thing for sure we know about Mariupol, he should allow humanitarian carters to let people on that steel mill and other places are buried under rubble to get out, to get out, that’s what any head of state would do in such a circumstance. And so there is no evidence yet that Mariupol is completely fall.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (13:34)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President [crosstalk 00:13:37]-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 5: (13:37)', 'Speech': 'On Title 42 [inaudible 00:13:37], are you considering delaying lifting Title 42?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:38)', 'Speech': 'No, what I’m considering is continuing to hear from my… Well, first of all, there’s going to be an appeal by the Justice Department, because as a matter of principle we want to be able to be in a position where if in fact it is strongly concluded by the scientists that we need Title 42, that we be able to do that, but there has been no decision on extending Title 42. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (14:06)', 'Speech': '[crosstalk 00:14:06] How long can the US maintain the level and pace of this military support for Ukraine?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:12)', 'Speech': 'Well we have the capacity to do this for a long time. The question is, are we going to continue to maintain the support of the international community and keep the pressure on Putin to prevent him from overrunning the country? Number one, and number two, make sure we continue to maintain the economic sanctions, which over time, and we’re beginning to see they’re devastating their economy and their ability to move forward. So the most important thing right now is maintain unity, so far, so good.

Above all, I want to thank each of you for your dedication to the service of this country and your members, families, and the longstanding service that you’ve all put in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:27)', 'Speech': 'I also want to recognize the groundbreaking nature of this gathering. For the first time in the proud history of the armed forces, we not only have a highly qualified woman as the vice president, but as deputy secretary of defense and two women combatant commanders, and it’s an important milestone. I think that speaks to how we’re harnessing the strength and diversity of our country and making sure women succeed in the military throughout their careers. As I said, when I got elected and I didn’t think people thought I meant it, but my administration’s going to look like America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:04)', 'Speech': 'And I mean that sincerely, not just in the military, but across the board. That’s where our strength comes from in my view. And today I want to hear from all of you on your assessments on what you’re seeing in the field and across our forces and the strategic environment this is evolving rapidly in the world. But that means our plans and forced posture have to be equally dynamic. Things are changing and ensuring that the security of the American people are at interest and interest of our allies means having to constantly adapt to anything and everything that’s happening around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:40)', 'Speech': 'And we’re seeing this very day the need for adaptation as a consequence of us standing with Ukraine against Putin’s brutal and unjustified war. And I want to applaud the exceptional work you’re doing to arm and equip brave Ukrainians to defend their nation. I don’t know about you, but I’ve been to Ukraine a number times before the war. I’ve spoken to the Rada. I was deeply involved in what was going on in Ukraine, and I knew they were tough and proud, but I tell you what, they’re tougher and more proud than I thought. I’m amazed what they’re doing with your help in terms of providing advice and the weaponry we’re providing along with the rest of NATO.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:27)', 'Speech': 'Weapons and ammunition are flowing in daily. And we’re seeing just how vital our alliances and partnerships are around the world. Our allies are stepping up amplifying the impact of our response and NATO is united and focused and energized as has ever been. When I was a kid in the United States Senate in my 30s and into my 40s, I was the chairman of the NATO subcommittee and the foreign relations committee. I, not because of me or any particular thing, but I’ve never seen NATO as united.

As commander in chief, I rely on your advice and maintain our military edge in and remain the ultimate guarantor of America’s security.

My name is Elisa Graceffo, I am a mom of three kids from Sammamish, Washington, it’s about 30 miles north of here. On Christmas Eve, in 2008, my oldest daughter, Juliana, who is standing here, she was four. She became pale and lethargic. She was feeling so bad that she skipped our Christmas Eve dinner. We thought it was the flu. She continued to feel worse and worse throughout that evening, and by the middle of the night, she started having difficulty breathing. We called 911, and an ambulance came and took us to Seattle Children’s Hospital. When we arrived, the ER doctor asked if anyone had checked Juliana’s blood sugar. No one had, and when they checked, it was over 700. A normal blood sugar ranges between 90 and 100. The ER doctor told me immediately that Juliana had Type one diabetes, which is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. This restricts her ability to get energy from food. Type one diabetes lasts a lifetime, and people with Type one must take insulin to live. Juliana spent the next 36 hours in a coma-like state called diabetic ketoacidosis, in the pediatric ICU, before they were able to stabilize her. We spent the next days in the hospital learning how to take care of a young child with this disease. It’s a 24/7 process of checking blood sugars, counting the carbohydrates of everything your child eats so you can calculate the right amount of insulin to give, and giving insulin shots. Blood sugars going too high or too low can have devastating short-term and long-term consequences. Living with Type one diabetes is a family affair. One of my philosophies in life, which I try to impart to my children, is that when life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade. Our family has been involved in raising awareness and funds for Type one diabetes research, to help prevent, treat, and cure Type one since shortly after Juliana was diagnosed. We are proud that through our Team Juliana efforts, we have raised nearly half a million dollars for diabetes research.'}, {'Time': 'Elisa: (02:15)', 'Speech': 'It’s hard to make lemonade when the cost of some of the ingredients can be so high, and steadily increase. No one should suffer or die in America because they cannot afford insulin. That is unacceptable. Fortunately for us, today Juliana is in high school and thriving. But, as a parent, the worry never ceases. For the millions of other families across America, there is no time to lose. We need to act. Thank you for this opportunity. I’d like to invite my daughter, Juliana, to share a few words now.'}, {'Time': 'Juliana: (02:58)', 'Speech': 'Thank you mom. It is an honor for my family and me to be here today to talk about the importance of insulin affordability. My name is Juliana Graceffo, and I am a senior at East Lake High School in Sammamish, Washington. As my mom just recounted, I have been living with Type one diabetes since I was four years old. Here, in fact, is the insulin pump that delivers the essential insulin hormone which I need to survive to my body, through this tube, and into my skin. Once my family got over the initial shock of this diagnosis, and gained some confidence in how to manage it day to day, we turned our attention to advocacy. As a high school freshman, I represented Washington state with a group that went to Washington, DC, to lobby Congress to pass the Special Diabetes Program, which provides $150 million in research funding over three year cycles to this cause. We were successful in getting that passed. Thank you to Senators Murray and Cantwell, and Representative Schrier for their support on that.'}, {'Time': 'Juliana: (04:17)', 'Speech': 'The federal government has such a huge role to play in advancing basic research on diabetes and so many other areas, and we have seen real results, too. When I was four, Type one diabetes treatment consisted of 10 or more finger poke blood tests a day, and 10 to 15 insulin injections a day, with regular syringes. Today, I wear a continuous glucose monitor my skin, which tests my blood sugar level every five minutes. This data is wirelessly transferred to my insulin pump, which uses advanced software algorithms to calculate insulin dosages on my behalf, then delivers the necessary insulin through a tube, into the site on my skin.'}, {'Time': 'Juliana: (05:02)', 'Speech': 'None of this progress would’ve been possible without the support of the federal government and private organizations. But, the common element in these improved treatments is insulin. We have better ways to dose and deliver the required insulin, but we still need the insulin itself. Here, during my 14 years and counting as a diabetic, we have seen nothing but increase after increase in the cost of insulin, a human hormone whose DNA sequence exists in the public domain. In fact, this cost has tripled over the past decade, while the insulin itself is largely unchanged. We need something to change. I am honored to introduce someone who is working to deliver that change. A president who understands the hopes and dreams of families like mine across this country. Please welcome President Biden.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:52)', 'Speech': 'Juliana, my colleagues. I’m taking her back to Washington. We’re going to get the rest of my bill passed. We’re going to get it done. By the way, I hope don’t don’t embarrass her, she’s off the Notre Dame next year. I’ve done the commencement there a couple times. I told her, if she sees me on campus, I don’t want her to say, “Joe who,” when I come up to see her. Promise?'}, {'Time': 'Juliana: (06:28)', 'Speech': 'Promise.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:29)', 'Speech': 'God love you. Thank you very, very much.'}, {'Time': 'Juliana: (06:30)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:30)', 'Speech': 'Thank you Mom.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:35)', 'Speech': 'Elisa and Juliana, thank you for that introduction. As my mother would say, God love you. You’re saving lives. You’re saving lives by pointing out what needs to be done. I want to start off, though, by pointing out a couple of things. Number one, as was mentioned earlier, my wife Jill is a community college professor. I believe she’s the only First Lady ever to work full time, and she’s still working full time, as a community college professor. That’s why she’s not with me today. One of the things we’re also working on, parenthetically, and this is a great college. It really is.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:23)', 'Speech': 'Thanks, in part, to the leadership of the governor, you’re one of the best systems in the country. I want you to know though, that we know, and I know firsthand…my wife’s an English professor, and teaches writing as well. The number of students to come back to schools like this, and the community college where Jill teaches, Northern Virginia Community College, are coming back having not been in school for a long time, many times. Coming back because they want to better their lives, breaking their necks to get here. The average age of my wife’s students is 28 years of age. That’s the average age of people coming back, coming through difficult circumstances they find themselves in. Back east, a number of immigrant families coming through, and the cost is still, no matter how the states try to control it, still matters.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:18)', 'Speech': 'One of the things, it didn’t do all I wanted to do, but was I able to sign a new budget bill that increases the Pell Grants by $400 a year, the largest increase in 10 years. We have to do more. Look, I want to say a special thank you to Governor Inslee, for his welcome and his partnership across a broad range of issues, including strengthening your economy, and the fighting the pandemic. I refer to him, and he knows this to be true, because of when I was seeking the nomination, he is the environmental governor of the nation. This guy is leading the whole country.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:10)', 'Speech': 'You have one heck of a congressional delegation, starting with my friend, Patty Murray. When we passed the Recovery Act, the first bill we passed, I went to Patty, and I said, “I want to deal with the Child Tax Credit,” which was something that had to be done. Patty’s been fighting for it for years and years and years. I got it passed, we got it passed. It reduced child poverty in America by 40%. But because of a couple folks, we lack one Democrat and 50 Republicans from keeping it from passing this time around. It fundamentally changed the lives of millions of people, Patty, you know it better than I do. It reduced child poverty by 40%.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:11)', 'Speech': 'She talked earlier about the cost of child care. I was a single dad for five years. My wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident. I commuted every day, 250 miles, 270 miles a day from Wilmington, Delaware, to Washington, DC, on Amtrak. Everybody thought I did it because I wanted to be home. That’s true, but I did it because I couldn’t possibly afford childcare. I was a United States Senator. I had the dubious distinction for 36 years of being listed as the poorest man in the Senate. I was making a lot of money as a Senator, from my perspective. I didn’t think I should be making any money other than my salary as a Senator. I could not possibly afford, even back in 1972 and ’73, I could not afford childcare.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': '… 1972 and three, I could not afford childcare. That’s why I went home every single night, over 200,000 miles worth of my career. And folks, there’s easy answers, there’s easy answers. We can do all that Patty and I, and others have been talking about and not one person in America making less than $400,000, you will see a single solitary increase in their taxes, not one, not a single increase. And folks, I sometimes been called by some of my interesting Republican friends, we’re all the Democrats, we’re are all socialists, and I’m a capitalist. And I think if you can make a billion dollars, or a million dollars, or 100 million, you should be able to do it. But pay your fair share, pay your fair share.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:00)', 'Speech': 'I come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the Union combined. And I got elected six times a Senator, notwithstanding that. Here’s the point, on the Fortune 500 companies, 40 of them last year, they made $40 billion and didn’t pay a single solitary penny in taxes. It’s not right. It’s just not fair. All they got to do is just pay a fair share. And we can do all of this and so much more, but that’s not what [inaudible 00:12:40] being here tonight, or today, I should say. And Senator Cantwell, she’s been a champion in this state to keep playing the bipartisan infrastructure law and delivering high speed internet all across the state of Washington. And because we’re going to out compete the rest of the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:56)', 'Speech': 'She understands how we do. We got to have you have access, access to that information. Think about it. During the pandemic, how many of your parents had to drive your kids into a McDonald’s parking lot to get on the internet to be able to do your homework? Not a joke. This is the United States of America for God’s sake, the United States of America. Because of this lady and others, we are going to see to it, every single place in this country, rural, urban, suburban, has access to high speed internet.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:28)', 'Speech': 'The Congresswoman Schrier, who represents a district, a doctor, an MD, who knows what folks go through in our healthcare system and knows how to make it better. This includes how to fill the nursing shortage to help colleges like this one train and prepare the next generation of nurses and healthcare workers. My wife went to Delaware Community College, and now in Northern Virginia, teaches an awful lot of nurses, an awful lot of nurses. And by the way, docs are okay. I’ve been a significant consumer of healthcare in my career. Unfortunately, I was hospitalized for the better part of seven months with two cranial aneurysms and embolism. And my son Beau came back as a decorated war hero from the state from Iraq after a year and stage four glioblastoma, and spent 15 months at the end, just hanging on. And doctors let you live. Nurses, male and female, I’m not seeing any of you in nursing programs, they make you want to live. Not a joke, not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:53)', 'Speech': 'I think it’s a single most underrated profession in the United States of America, I really mean it. When I was at Walter Reed, all those months, I’d lay there in that ICU and look at the monitors. And if any of those lines go flat, you’re in trouble. But seriously, after a while, and you’ve seen the doc, you just get tired. I wasn’t in pain, just get tired, just want to stop. And my nurses, I remember to this day their names, they’d come in and they’d change the pillow, they’d rub my head, they’d do something, they’d keep you moving, talk to you, talk to you. That’s why, what I did was they ensured everybody who comes out of an intensive care unit, the joke is in hospitals is, they either get taken out in a… The nurses never see them again, they either get taken out in a bag and or they never want to come back. I used to go back once a month and have dinner with the nurses every night on the night shift to thank them.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:51)', 'Speech': 'So anybody in here, well, I’m not sure how many are part of the college, but any of you study nursing keep up.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (15:57)', 'Speech': 'There are over here.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:58)', 'Speech': 'Well, God loves you. No I really mean it. Never want to disappoint you, because the male nurses are the consequences of the female nurses. Okay. Not a joke. And so, anyway, I just wanted to mention that and I want to thank Congresswoman Kilmer and for the nearby district, the sixth district, I guess, he’s leading the charge in the economy to make sure that we leave no community behind. And we’re also joined today by Larson, and I know. You’re going to [crosstalk 00:16:43]. No, I got it. DelBene, who’s a real champion for working families, and while she couldn’t be here today, Congresswoman Jayapal was doing an incredible job in a state. She’s visiting, she’s been a great partner of mine and worked really close with me. And she’s visiting her family now, and she’ll be back shortly.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:06)', 'Speech': 'But folks, we’re all laser focused on lowering the cost for you and your families across the board. And a big way to do that is lower the cost of healthcare, healthcare especially in the area of prescription drugs. The governor in this state has already gotten insulin down to 35 bucks for, I guess, it’s a year you’ve done it so far, is that right? Well, either early this month, president Obama came back to the White House. He’s a good friend, he came back to the white house for the first time and a long time to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. And we talked about how hard it was to get it done in the first place and why we were so determined to get it done. It was through the people who desperately needed and had no alternatives, and deserved to be treated with, as my dad the word he used most, is everyone just is entitled to be treated with dignity, everyone. And there’s loss of your dignity not being able to take care of a child who’s sick, or a wife, or a spouse, or husband.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:04)', 'Speech': 'And countless Americans lie in bed at night staring up at the ceiling, wondering what happens, what happens if I get sick? What happens if I get prostate cancer and my wife gets breast cancer, what do we do? How do we take care of the family? Who’s going to pay for it? What’s going to happen? Thousands and thousands of Americans stare at that ceiling. So we did it with the idea that an American healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. And well with the help of the leaders here at a Federalist state level, we began to make some good on the proposition of fighting, and defending, and improving the Affordable Care Act after it got passed. If you can hold for a second here, remember, my colleagues will remember, I was out of office one year as vice president, the end of the term in the 2018 in elections. And remember the other team wanted to do away with Obamacare. They had scores of court cases, scores of votes to try to eliminate it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:09)', 'Speech': 'But what happened was a lot of people didn’t know, Barack is kind of a humble guy. And I used to say to him, after we won that Affordable Care fight, I said, “We have to take a victory lap, let people know what happened.” He said, “We don’t have time. We don’t have time.” Oh, guess what? I went into 58 races that year to campaign where there was an incumbent Republican and a Democrat running. [inaudible 00:19:32] Republicans who wanted to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. And what I pointed out was if in fact that Republican won that year, it took back to Congress, what was going to happen? Anyone with a preexisting condition could not get coverage again, not just an Affordable Care Act, but couldn’t get coverage in your personal insurance you paid for. And all of a sudden people went, “Whoa, we won 44 of those races.” And the one thing knowing that they’re going to eliminate the idea that if you have a preexisting condition, you couldn’t get coverage. Now you can under the Affordable Care Act.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:11)', 'Speech': 'Within the first months of my administration, we passed Landmark American Rescue Plan law that not only helped us get COVID 19 under control and our economy back on track, but had millions of people, more people insured, millions of people more insured under the Affordable Care Act. We made it easier for people to sign up for coverage in the middle of the pandemic. We opened a special enrollment period and gave millions of Americans more time to enroll in the Affordable Care Act. We quadrupled the number of navigators out in the communities, just helping folks know how to sign up to get the coverage. And here in Washington state, about 240,000 folks signed up for ACA coverage this last year, an additional 240,000. And we’re continuing to expand Medicare in states. There were a total of 36 states who said we’re going to cover, even though the federal government say we’re going to cover for free in the beginning, and they have to eventually sign on to help pay for it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:12)', 'Speech': 'Well, we added two more states. That’s millions of people who have now Medicaid coverage. Over 31 million Americans now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. And that includes nearly 900, 000 people across the state of Washington. Four out of five Americans can and find quality coverage for under $10 a month in the Affordable Care Act. We made it cheaper to purchase the premium plans on the Affordable Care Act. The average family today, since we passed that law in our administration, are saving $2,400 in annual premiums and getting better coverage. That’s $200 savings every month, allowing them to have more money available for other needs in their lives with inflation…'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:03)', 'Speech': '… have more money available for other needs in their lives, with inflation, with Putin’s gas tax, with the groceries because of the loss of access to the wheat fields in Russia and in Ukraine. Prescription drugs and other necessities, that $200 can make a difference in a month. The bottom of is this, the Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it’s ever been and we’re strengthening it even further. Earlier this month, I signed an executive order directing the federal agency to continue doing everything they can in their power to expand, to expand the quality of the affordable healthcare coverage. This work builds on what we’ve done to end the surprise charges you often see on medical bills, particularly at hospitals.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:48)', 'Speech': 'Any of you have been hospitalized, I hope they haven’t had to, but if you’ve been lately and you found out your coverage doesn’t cover a certain particular doctor, but you then get a surprise bill for a couple thousand bucks because, without your knowledge, they had another doctor looking at what you needed to do. No surprise bills anymore. They can’t do that. They can’t do that. No more surprise medical billing.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:13)', 'Speech': 'And separately we’re fixing what was referred to as the family glitch. But that is a common issue facing 5 million Americans who can’t get financial help or get coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Here’s the problem. Under the current rules, a working mom is told that as long as she can afford an employer-based coverage herself, she can’t qualify for premium subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, to afford coverage for the rest of her family. And so we changed that. We propose starting next year working families will get the help they need to afford family coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And as a result, these families will save hundreds of dollars a month. With this change, it’s estimated the 200,000 presently uninsured Americans will gain coverage. Nearly 1 million Americans will see their coverage become more affordable. This is considered one of the best things and biggest things my administration can do, is lower costs and expand coverage.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:26)', 'Speech': 'You talked about … I talked about and it was mentioned by several who spoke before me about just a little breathing room. I was raised in a town in Delaware, and it was a nice neighborhood, it was a three-bedroom split-level home when they were developing suburban areas and housing developments, that with four kids, a mom and a dad, and a grandpa living with us. And the walls were thin and you could hear. I remember one day, this true story, one night I could hear my dad was really restless getting up and down. And I asked my mom the next morning before I went to school what was wrong with Dad. She said, “They told him, Honey, that they’re not going to cover insurance anymore at his job.” Health insurance.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:14)', 'Speech': 'Well, like I said, it’s about dignity. It’s about worrying about your family. So we need to keep this fight up. And Republicans and I, as you know, I get criticized by the press because I’m not partisan enough. Okay. Well, this is not your father’s Republican Party as I said. They continue to attack the Affordable Care Act and want to eliminate it. They’re unrelenting, multiple court challenges, the sabotage from previous administration, over 70 attempts to repeal the law by Republicans in Congress, 70 times. In fact, just last month, Republican Senator John, excuse me, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said if the Republicans are back in power, we’re going to take back the House in the Senate, they should repeal the Affordable Care Act again. Twelve years later, Republicans still haven’t stopped their attacks on this lifesaving law.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:10)', 'Speech': 'So pay close attention. If they have their way, it means a hundred million Americans with preexisting condition will once again be denied health coverage, not hyperbole, this is fact, will be denied healthcare coverage by their insurance companies. That’s what the law was before Obamacare. In addition, tens of millions of Americans could lose their coverage, including young people who will no longer be able to be covered by their parents’ plans up to age 26. Premiums are going to go through the roof. So there’s a lot at stake. Well, I’ve got a better idea. Instead of destroying the Affordable Care Act, let’s keep building on it. Extend the American Rescue Plan subsidies that we’ve already passed, allowing lower premiums and expanded coverage, close the Medicaid coverage gap that locks nearly 4 million Americans out of coverage just because they’re in states that refuse to expand Medicaid, and let’s do something that will bring down prices, lower the cost of prescription drugs.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:12)', 'Speech': 'Let me note parenthetically, the only thing that Medicare cannot negotiate with healthcare providers on are drugs. They can tell you that they’re only going to pay X amount of money for doctor visits, Y amount of money for a particular operation, et cetera. But the only thing they can’t negotiate are prescription drugs, except for one area. We insisted a long time ago that the department that relates to the military, you have a great guy running the Veterans Affairs now, Veterans Affairs can say, “We’re not going to pay you any more than X or Y for this particular drug.” But you can’t do that for anything else. Medicare can’t do that anywhere else.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:01)', 'Speech': 'In America, we pay the highest prescription drug cost of any developed nation in the world. That’s a fact. It’s about two and a half to three times higher than paid for the same exact drug, the same manufacturer in other countries. For example, the anti-cancer drug to treat leukemia and lymphoma cost $1,400 a month in the United States. Some of you may know that. The same exact drug, the same exact company, same distribution costs $6,000, not $14,000 in France, the same company, American company, same exact amount. It’s unconscionable.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:51)', 'Speech': 'Today, one in four Americans who need prescription drugs struggle to afford them. Nearly 30% of people needing essential drug doses that they’re supposed to take, 30% skip their doses because they want to extend the life of the drug that they need. Many people use over-the-counter drugs instead or cut pills in half because they can’t afford them. There’s others who simply not fill their prescriptions at all. As I said, for God’s sake, this is the United States of America. What are we doing? It’s simply wrong, especially since it doesn’t cost the drug companies nearly as much to make the drug or the research that went into it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (29:35)', 'Speech': 'There’s a system they have in Germany and other countries, that the drug company can charge … the price is set when they, in fact, try to bring the drug on market. It’s like, in our case, the FDA approve it. And the way it works is they go, “How much did you invest to come up with the drug? How much did you put in?” And they allow healthy profit it of 10, 20, 30, 40%. And say, “That’s what you can sell it for in our country unless you invest more to improve the drug and show you put more into it. Otherwise, you can’t go above the cost of inflation.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:16)', 'Speech': 'Look, the incident we’re talking about, do you know how much it costs to make that vial insulin? $10. T-E-N. $10 to treat diabetes. $10. A condition that affects millions of Americans, including a Congresswoman. But some families have to pay hundreds of dollars a month. Some, even over a thousand dollars. The average cost is $863 a month, or excuse me, $683 a month for a lifesaving insulin. You just heard Allise and Julia talk about trying to afford insulin and treat the type one diabetes. Imagine what it’s like if you don’t have insurance and you don’t have the cash to look at your child knowing what they need and knowing there’s not a damn thing going to do about it. Not only is your child put in jeopardy, you’re deprived of your dignity. How do you look at your child and deal with it? And there’s no excuse. None. We’re not asking drug companies to do anything that they can’t afford. If you think it doesn’t affect you, it does. Everyone has less money in their pocket today because of the high cost of healthcare. Over the past decade, healthcare costs have gone up 50%. And a major reason for that increase is the cost of the drugs in healthcare. Folks, we may not agree on everything. I think it’s safe to say that all of us, whatever our background, our age, where we live, agree that prescription drugs are out outrageously expensive. So here’s what I’m proposing. I met with the 12 largest drug manufacturers when I did the initiative, the president … last president, Obama when I was vice president, allowed me to do to deal with the cost of this. And I met with them and I said … they said … I said what if you find the cure for a particular drug, what should you be able to charge for a major cancer facility? They said whatever the market will bear. I said, no. I said, here’s the deal. Here’s what I think you should do. If you have to spend millions of dollars, you should be able to recoup everything you put into it. But if it’s way beyond the cost of the average American, the federal government should step up and compensate you for it, so that the, in fact, the American-'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (33:03)', 'Speech': '… and compensate you for it so that, in fact, the American people can still have life-saving drugs. So here’s what I’m proposing, with the help of the members of Congress. First, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month. That still means it costs them $10, three-and-a-half times as much as it costs them. Second, let’s end the days when companies could increase prices with no oversight and no accountability. If drug companies increase their prices faster than the rate of inflation, they should have to face a steep tax. We’re saying… By the way, we wouldn’t let the utility companies do it. Utilities can’t all of a sudden raise their cost of the utilities you’re paying. We’re saying, “Drug companies, you’re finally going to be held accountable when you raise prices for the American people. You should be able to make a significant profit, but not gouge.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (34:05)', 'Speech': 'Third, let’s cap the amount that seniors on Medicare have to spend for prescription drugs each year. If you’re on Medicare, you won’t have to spend more than $2,000 out-of-pocket, which is a lot of money, and that’s no more than 170 bucks a month, no matter how many prescriptions you’re taking, because the Medicare will take up the rest. Drug companies, insurance companies, Medicare would pick up the rest of the cost. Finally, let’s give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices, for every other type of healthcare, uses it to leverage lower prices for American seniors. But for prescription drugs, the only prescription drug Medicare is prohibited by law from negotiating to get the best deals for seniors. By the way, it didn’t put the drug company… We’re just saying, Medicare’s not going to buy it. They’re not going to buy it beyond a certain price. It doesn’t mean you can’t continue to manufacture and ask the billion dollars for it, but the federal government’s not going to pay for it. It’s long past time we get rid of these absurd limitations.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (35:24)', 'Speech': 'Let Medicare negotiate fair prices. Reflect the cost of the research, the development, the need for a significant profit, but also affordable for seniors. Let me close with this. I grew up in a family where prices went up for things for daily requirements like the gallon and gasoline. It became a discussion at the kitchen table. It mattered. It was always on the margins. We felt it. That’s why I’m so focused on doing everything I can to lower the cost of gas and energy and accelerate our transition to clean energy. I also know there are other basic needs that affect the standard of living for most families. I was a single dad, as I said, for five years. I couldn’t afford childcare, no way I could, but I had a sister and a brother. We have an expression in my family, for real, not a joke. “If you have to ask, it’s too late.” Think about it. So when my wife and daughter were killed and the boys came home from the hospital, I found out my sister and her husband already moved into my house.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (36:31)', 'Speech': 'I’d purchased an old farmhouse, a colonial farmhouse in Northern Delaware. It had a little barn on it as well. It was only a couple acres. My brother came in and spent money changing the barn, the upstairs of the barn, into an apartment. My brother and sister moved in. I’d drop my kids off every morning when I’d go to the train station with my mom. But look, as I said, I had a good job. How do people make it? But I know childcare is hard. It costs a lot of money. That’s why with your members of Congress led by Patty, who’s an absolute leader on this, I want to cap the cost of childcare for families making under $125,000 to 7% of your income. We can do these things without raising taxes a penny in anyone, as I said, making under 400,000 bucks. The bottom line is this. When I was running for the president, you heard me say a 1,000, you probably got tired of it now, that we’re going to build this economy around you, the American middle class. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy do very well. They never hurt when the middle class is doing well, and we’re going to deal in people and the place that has been left out and left behind. We’re making progress. Over the course of my presidency so far, 14 months, we’ve created 7.9 million good-paying jobs, more jobs created in 14 months than any presidency in a year ever. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, down from 6.4% when I took office. The fastest decline in unemployment the start of any presidency ever recorded. Washington State, you’ve added 218,000 jobs, an unemployment drop from 6.3 to 4.2%. Last year in 2021, we cut… And all this was going on, we cut the deficit. All my friends talk about how they care about the deficit. We cut it $350 billion last year.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (38:56)', 'Speech': 'This year in 2022, we’re on track to cut the deficit by more than I want… Mark it down because you remind me of this, by $1.3 trillion, 1.3. That stays on course with the largest one-year reduction of a deficit in history. This is particularly important now, as we work to reduce pressure on inflation. From Washington State, to all across America, we’ve gone from on the mend to on the move. We’re coming at our challenges from position of strength. I’m more optimistic. I’m more optimistic about America today than I’ve been in my whole life, my whole career, because I see a future that’s within our grasp. We’re the only nation on earth… Think about this. Now, we’re the only nation on earth that has always come out of every crisis we’ve ever met stronger than we went in it. No other nation in the world can say that. It’s because you, because of the ingenuity and the determination of the American people. We’ve just looked at opportunity and seized it. That’s exactly what we’re doing today.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (40:10)', 'Speech': 'So as my grandfather figured, he used to say, “With the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, we’re going to do [inaudible 00:40:18].” It’s going to be hard for a while getting through the cost of gasoline and energy because of Putin and the war, but we’re going to do it. With your help, and I say to all the folks who are students here, I wish you well. We need you badly. The reason I’m so optimistic, think about it, you are the least prejudice, the most involved, the most concerned generation in American history. You really are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you all. Appreciate it. Thanks.'}]"

I’ve only been here once before. I came to speak years ago. And on my own, I came up here to take a look. And it’s really quite beautiful. Governor Inslee, who is known, where I’m from, as the environmental governor and I’m Mayor Harley Senator Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, you got everybody here. You got representative Smith, Larson, DelBene, Schrier, and it’s an honor of being this beautiful park with y’all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:50)', 'Speech': '[Everett Abbey 00:00:50], the writer who once worked as a park ranger, I didn’t know he had been right, a park ranger, tell you the truth, wrote the following: “Every man, every woman carries in heart and mind an image of an ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, actual or visionary.” For many Saddle families, I think were in that place right now, here in this park, and places like this. There’re not that many like this, unfortunately. And all around this country, there used to be a hell of a lot more forests like this. But we’re doing everything we can, everybody behind me. And all of you want desperately to protect what we have and increase what we have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:35)', 'Speech': 'Our natural wonders, the reflection inspires to take action.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:45)', 'Speech': 'My mother had an expression and I apologize to my colleagues. They’ve heard me do two things my whole career. Quote my Mother and Father. And quote Irish poets. But I’m not going to quote the Irish poet today. Okay? But she said, “Out of everything difficult, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.” And I think that we’re in one of those moments in world history and in American History, where we’ve reached the point that the crisis on the environment has become so obvious with the notable exception of the former president, that we really have an opportunity to do things we couldn’t have done two, five, 10 years ago.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:24)', 'Speech': 'And I want to talk about that today with leaders who understand that to their core, the folks standing behind me. I wish you didn’t have to stand. Don’t you guys have any chairs or…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:35)', 'Speech': 'I’m not used to them standing for me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:37)', 'Speech': 'Anyway, but here’s the deal. As I said, Governor Inslee is the climate governor. I’ve gone to him throughout asking him for advice and counsel. And thanks for welcoming me back to Washington State, Gov and to Mayor [Harrell 00:02:53] the passport to the city is very much appreciated. I hope I don’t do anything to have it revoked. And Congressman Smith, thank you for your commitment to the environment, including helping our armed forces transition to clean energy technologies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:07)', 'Speech': 'One of the things I’ve found out as the President of the United States, I get to spend a lot of that money. I get to decide where… No, I’m not joking. And we’re going to completely…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:16)', 'Speech': 'I’m going to the process where every vehicle in the United States Military, every vehicle, is going to be climate-friendly. Every vehicle. No I’m mean it. We’re spending billions of dollars to do it. And it’s going to matter. It matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:37)', 'Speech': 'In my view, this crisis is, as I said, is a genuine opportunity. An opportunity to do things we wanted to do. And only now, have become so apparent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:47)', 'Speech': 'On this day, 52 years ago, millions of Americans of every age and background rallied together on Earth Day. A guy I worked with as a young Senator back in those days was a guy named Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin. And the guy who helped organize Earth Day was a guy who was from Delaware, worked for me as well. And Mike McCabe. They had a vision, a vision for a healthier, more prosperous America. And over time they delivered, they delivered cleaner water, proof that sustainable environment can mean a stronger economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:25)', 'Speech': 'And one of the things I’m proudest of in our Administration, before I went into detail with my, quote, “Green Agenda,” I got all the unions together. Literally got all the unions together because I said the unions view it as against their interest. And starting with the IBW Electric Workers, they endorsed it. And every union has stepped up because they figured it out. Their jobs. They’re the ones who can help us transition in ways like never before. It’s not going to cost them jobs. It’s going to increase jobs. The IBW’s going to be building 50, 000 electric charging stations all across America, for example.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:06)', 'Speech': 'And so look, change continues today in a new generation of Americans helping us lead the way against the threat of climate change. Every time I get a little down, I don’t know about my colleagues, I suspect they’re the same, I just turn on the television or take a look at all the young people. This young generation is not going to put up with a lot of this stuff. No, they’re not. They are really, really energized. Whether it’s basic human rights or it’s the environment, they’re just not stopping. And from day one of my Administration, we’ve stood with them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:37)', 'Speech': 'Governor, hate to admit it, but I was part of that early Earth Day. I was only seven years old. God. Oh, my Lord. I can’t believe I said that. But anyway, it’s been a passion of mine, as long as I’ve been involved in public life. The first thing, what got me involved in politics, not that it matters to you all, but I was thinking about it on the way over here. I was a young attorney in Delaware and they wanted to, across the top of my state, they wanted to connect two highways. And it’s through what is the most beautiful part of the state. But instead of being willing to do it in an area that, in fact, had no consequence for the environment, they decided to put it through areas that were straighter but more damaging. And I got involved to try to stop the construction of that highway, which I did. That’s what got me involved. And it caused me great problems because I ended up having to run for the county council, which was the hardest job I ever had. [inaudible 00:06:43] Any rate.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:44)', 'Speech': 'But as a matter of fact, in 1986 in the United States Senate, I introduced and we passed the first Global Climate Protection Act the first time. And it was a warming legislation in the Senate. And on Earth Day, we convened last year, over 40 leaders around the globe, reasserting America’s leadership on climate. After four years of administration denying that there was a climate crisis, denying that there was any need to do anything about the environment. And the commitments galvanized at that meeting, including our own goal of cutting emissions for 52% below 25 levels by 2030, and reaching net zero emissions by 2050, taking the steps the United States needs to limit the planet’s warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. And the rest of the world started to come along.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:34)', 'Speech': 'We did more than set bold goals. We acted to achieve them. Last year with all the disappointments we faced, but last year, the United States deployed the most solar wind and battery storage in American history. And we made record-setting investments in clean energy in rural America. For example, we have a $1 billion program that no one knows about except the Department of Agriculture, that grants and loans for farmers and rural co-ops to deploy solar, and storage, and power lines to carry clean energy across-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:03)', 'Speech': '… deploy solar and storage and power lines to carry clean energy across the country. We are investing in technology so you can heat and cool your home when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. Because out here in Silicon Valley, you’re developing the battery technology. They showed me one that’s about a little bit wider than this podium, about that thick and about this wide, that in fact you can install in your home. And when the sun ain’t shining, that stored electricity runs the whole deal. And by the way, by the way, windmills don’t cause cancer. And across the country, we have enough clean energy capacity to power now 56 million homes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:42)', 'Speech': 'Now here’s what we’re doing with automobiles. I’m an automobile buff. I have a ’68 Corvette that does nothing but pollute the air, but I don’t drive very much. But I brought together the automobile manufacturers and Mary Barry, who runs General Motors, is a fine, fine person. At the time, she was suing the state of California, General Motors, for their increased mileage requirements that exceeded the federal standard. Exceeded yes, the federal standard and the argument General Motors was making was, you couldn’t exceed the federal standard locally.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:23)', 'Speech': 'We had a long talk, and I didn’t suggest it, but she dropped that suit and contacted me and said, ” I’m going to make a commitment.” I brought together the American automobile industry and they agreed on an ambitious goal. 50% electric vehicles sales by year 2030. That’s the commitment that they made. I didn’t make it for them. They made it. Because they realized what the future is. I saw it when I drove Ford’s all electric 150 pickup truck, which I might add, which was disappointing, it’s faster than my Corvette. You think I’m kidding?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:55)', 'Speech': 'It’s a four turbo. Although I did suggest if I’m out of office and they have the first electric Corvette, I want to buy it. But anyway, and when I drove the electric Jeep Wagoneer around south lawn of the White House. To date, auto makers have announced investments in more than $100 billion in EV manufacturing, $100 billion. That’s along with us setting ambitious standards to cut pollution in cars and trucks to boost fuel economy standards, which are going to be announcing very soon, upping the mileage requirement for the minimum mileage requirement. But that’s not all. The bipartisan infrastructure law, which the folks behind me are the reason why that occurred, I signed provides billions of dollars for a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations, 500,000. And with electric school buses, by the way, down in North Carolina, you should see the factory down there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:52)', 'Speech': 'These buses, they have electric vehicles. It has a platform folks from me to you about that thick, weighs about six zillion pounds, no engine, nothing else, that’s it. But it’s all electric, all electric. And guess what? We’re going to eliminate tens of thousands of diesel school buses, which pollute the air and pollute the lungs. And look, this industry and union workers are all stepping up and there’s a lot more. Here in Washington state, you’re going to triple the federal commitment to your link… We’re going to triple the federal commitment to your link light rail system, speeding progress in the largest transit…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:35)', 'Speech': 'As my colleagues in the Senate will recall, I was referred to as Mr. Amtrak. I’ve taken over 1,200,000 miles in Amtrak commuting every single day. You think I’m joking. For 36 years, every single day the Senate was in session to go home and see my kids. But the folks, it’s a simple proposition. Most people don’t realize it. Given a choice to go from point A to point B on rail, electric rail, or drive your automobile. If you can get there fast, as fast or faster on rail, you take the rail. The estimates will take millions of vehicles off the road. The largest transit construction project in the country that runs entirely on clean energy. The bipartisan infrastructure will provide $66 billion, it’s passed $66 billion for freight rail, 39 billion for public transit, 10.6 billion for clean electric buses and 2.5 billion for clean fairies on my coast of Delaware and out here for you all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:40)', 'Speech': 'This will take millions of cars worth of pollution off the road and get people to places quicker. Look, I think one Amtrak train carries as many passengers, I know the statistics, as six lanes of a major interstate highway. That’s how many passengers it carries. Look, it matters. We saw new standards, we set new standards. We slashed methane and brought over 100 nations together when I was at the big meeting we had in Europe, hundred nations around the globe, and there’s two things I was able to accomplish. One, I got a pledge, a pledge from a hundred, I think it was 144 of them, that they would eliminate methane and do the same thing we’re doing to keep it. It’s the most damaging of all the pollutants that are going up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:28)', 'Speech': 'We also set new standards for super polluting HFC emissions. Remember the big fight we had? I know because when I almost lost an election because the DuPont Company makes… Long story. Anyway, but look, we set new standards for cleaner cement. You say, “What the hell are you talking about Joey?” This is probably the only audience to understand cleaner cement. Cement is an incredible pollutant, an incredible pollutant. And it matters because cement’s responsible for 8% of the global climate emissions. Cement. I got to admit to you, as long as I’ve been involved in this, until two years ago, I didn’t know that. And we’re delivering across the country. Lots of folks have promised it but my administration is actually delivering revitalizing communities across Appalachia. Look, folks, I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania where I was raised, the reason I got to Delaware as coal died, my dad was not in the coal mines, he was in sales, but the whole economy died.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:25)', 'Speech': 'And you can understand why in places like West Virginia and Southeastern Pennsylvania, why people were worried about doing away with coal. But it’s their jobs. They wonder what they’re going to do. But guess what? In the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the law’s going to help us cap and seal abandoned mines. There’s thousands of abandoned mines, cap and seal them. They’re no longer going to seep pollution into the air of the water. The laws putting abandoned mine workers to work at the same salary they were working digging the mines in the first place. There’s several thousand of these wells that have to be capped and they have to harvest the energy and they’re going to get paid. So we’ve provided alternatives. They’re manufacturing and installing solar panels where they once dug for coal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:13)', 'Speech': 'Look, out here in the west, we’re re-powering retired power plants and clean hydrogen, advanced nuclear, making them economic hubs again. And in the Heartland and the fields that feed our country, we’re planning cover crops to pull carbon out of the air and out of the atmosphere. They’re becoming carbon sinks. Look, across the country we set the first national conservation goal and protecting more land and water than any other administration and record in our first year because we can do it. And now the farmers are beginning to realize, if I put things in conservation, I get paid for putting cover crops down that absorb carbon. It makes sense to me. It keeps the land open and it makes the environment much better. And they get paid for it and they should get paid for it. It’s their land.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': '… and much better and they get paid for it and they should get paid for, it’s their land. We’re protecting natural wonders and cultural treasures, national monuments. I remember a little girl came up to me with her, I don’t know where, how it happened, but I was walking outside and a woman came up with her little girl and said, she said, “Mr. President, please protect Bears Ears.” I said, “I beg your pardon, honey.” “I said please protect Bears Ears.” I said, “Bears Ears.” She said, “Yes,” and I knew what Bears Ears was because I’ve tried to take my kids in almost every national park and I said, “Okay, honey.” She said, “Promise me, promise me,” and we did. Bears Ears [inaudible 00:16:45]'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:48)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, we got some of the conservative Republicans to support it in their state. We got some support for it and now we’re working to restore the salmon runs here in the Northwest. Look, we’re putting America on the cutting edge. We’ve approved the first commercial scale offshore wind project in federal waters which is already broken ground with US workers and US steel are going to be building these facilities. By the way I was up in Colorado and looking at the facilities we have there. We now have windmills that the blades in those windmills 102 yards long. Hear me, 102 yards long. They can be placed way out in the ocean and by the way, I made it clear to my friends up in Nantucket and that area, I don’t want to hear anymore about you don’t like looking at them. They’re pretty, but seriously, it’s incredible the breakthroughs that are making. Once you tell a nation that we can do this, go do it, it’s amazing what happens. It’s amazing what happens. We’ve launched the first ever commercial flight power by 100% sustainable aviation fuel, lifted off with fuel grown here in America, grown in America. We set the first net zero commitments for US steel companies and now we’re rewarded for clean air, clean production through our first ever international carbon bays trade deal, which makes clean American steel cheaper to buy than dirty steel from other countries. We’re making it clear to the rest of the world that’s what we’re going to do. We put environmental justice to the center of what we do, addressing the disproportionate health, environmental and economic impact that have been born primarily by communities of color, places too often left behind. I grew up, when Cole died in Scranton we moved to Delaware where my dad had grown up. We moved to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware, which was right at arch that goes up into the Pennsylvania area there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:56)', 'Speech': 'It’s near a place called Marcus Hook, where there were more at the time, more oil refineries than in Houston, than Houston because of 10 million people in that Delaware Valley up there. I went to a small little school that was about a mile from the apartment complex we lived in and a little school called Holy Rosary and you couldn’t walk to school because although it was a four lane access highway it was just too dangerous to cross some of the streets. My mother would get in the… And when it came spring, I mean it came the fall, this is the God’s truth, and you’d get in the car and the little frost on the window, turn on the windshield wiper there’d be an oil slick. Not a joke. I have asthma and 80% of the people who in fact we grew up with have asthma.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:44)', 'Speech': 'That’s what you call a fence line community. I understand what it’s like. We only live there. I went to school there for 12 years, but I didn’t live there that whole time. My generic point is you take a look, my state used to be, thank God it’s no longer, had the highest cancer rate of any state in the nation because we have fence line communities going down Route 9, going down along the Delaware River, major facilities, oil plants and the like. The people that get hurt are the people who live on the other side of those fences. I made a commitment, they’re the people who are going to get helped as we move this. They’re the people where the money’s going to go to help their neighborhoods and this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gives communities the money they need to get forever chemicals, PFAS off out of the water.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:31)', 'Speech': 'They’re deadly, deadly, and a lot of its responsible because we, the government and the military has engaged in activities that we didn’t realize how it danger over the years, but we’re going to get rid of it all. We started replacing 100%, 100% of all the lead pipes and poison that poison our water in America. 400,000 schools and daycare centers, the kids can’t turn on that water without getting we’re worried about whether there’s lead in that water, 10 million homes in America, and here in this city, in this state, because every American and every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water, which will also create thousands of good paying jobs for plumbers and pipe fitters and others. Look, all I got to do is look around, cities and states are acting. Businesses are acting. I’m acting.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:22)', 'Speech': 'We need Congress to act as well and the people behind me are pushing Congress hard. They’re pushing Congress hard. Fallen in the past new investments and tax credits aimed directly at lowering costs for families. Look, you talk about, a couple, there’s only two senators who occasionally don’t vote with me. That’s right. Literally 48, they talk about the split in the Democratic Party. There’s virtually no split in the Democratic Party. We just happen to have 50 presidents, you have 50 senators and 50 Democrats, 50 Republicans. I mean anyone can change the dynamic, but all kidding aside, 48% of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate vote with me 94% of the time. So it’s not like we have a split, but we don’t have, we have virtually no Republicans. There’s some we get up to as many as seven or eight will vote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:17)', 'Speech': 'This ain’t your father’s Republican party. Not a joke. All you got to do is look what that is being played on, played this morning about the tape that was released anyway, but all kidding aside, this is a mega party now. You got the senator from Texas and others, these guys are a different breed of cat. They’re not like what I served with for so many years. The people who know better are afraid to act correctly because they know they’ll be primary. I’ve had, I won’t mention any, I promised I never would and I won’t, but up to six come to me and say, Joe, I want to be with you on such and such, but I can’t, I’ll be primary. I’ll lose my race. I’ll lose my race. So folks we got, this is going to start to change.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:10)', 'Speech': 'Look, that bill that we talked about that is the Infrastructure Bill, there were two pieces of it. It was one bill initially. And that bill had about $800 million in it for environmental related issues. Well, the one that didn’t pass, the part that didn’t pass yet is one that has $531 million for environmental related issue. We got a lot done though in the bill that passed, called the Infrastructure Bill that has to do with the environment, including tax credits for purchase of electric and fuel cell vehicles. Now no are used, but you’re going to save typical driving about $80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump, tax credits for folks to buy solar panels that heat pumps, more efficient windows, saving each an average of $500 a year to do this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': '…an average of $500 a year to do this, just making your home tighter so you don’t leak the heat and leak the air conditioning you’re going out. And my pen’s ready. My pen’s ready to sign. I’m anxious to sign this. Get some of these bills to my desk. And we can’t forget… We can’t forget that achieving our ambitious climate goals are going to require nature itself to play a role. If you compare the map of North America in 1620, and we have some of these maps, with America today, you’ll see how much we’ve devastated our forest. I mean, it used to be if you’d look, from the Atlantic Coast almost to the Mississippi River was heavy forest. And we took it all down over those years. That’s why, today, I’m signing an executive order to conserve our forest that do so much to protect us. Our forest are our planet’s lungs. They literally are recycling and cycling CO2 out of the atmosphere. That’s what they do. By the way, more the… I spent time down in the Amazon, and in Columbia, and in Brazil. And guess what? More carbon is taken out of the air in the Amazon, that carbon sink, than every bit of carbon that is generated on a daily basis in the entire United States from every source.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:31)', 'Speech': 'So what we should be doing, and I’m trying to get done, they’re not going to maybe like this, we should be paying the Brazilians not to cut down their forest. We got to cut ours down. We got to cut ours down. We got the benefit of it, because we’ve got these third-world countries, not third-world, some are, in Africa and in South America, we got to… The industrial countries have to help. Sciences estimate that the protection and restoration of our natural lands and waters can provide more than one third of the solution to climate change. Just that, if we did nothing else.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:07)', 'Speech': 'So today, I’m about to sign an executive order to strengthen our forest on federal lands, and make them and the local economies they support more resilient in the face of wildfires. I’ve flown over every major wildfire in this country with FEMA, since… Not every. A couple, I didn’t, but the vast majority of them, and it’s devastating. I’ve seen it from helicopters with FEMA, just flying over here and Idaho. I didn’t get to go to Oregon, but California. It’s absolutely devastating. So we’re going to work with state and local and tribal governments to map, catalog, and then conserve old-growth forest on our public lands. These are the forests… We’re going to do this. These are the forests that store, sequester incredible amounts of carbon and help us fight climate change. The forest that are home to majestic trees, like the ones here in this park’s magnificent forest.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:06)', 'Speech': 'The executive order I’m going to sign is going to make good on the international forest protection commitments from the proposal I made in Scotland at Glasgow 26. I got 140 countries to sign up and say, that together… And we represent 90% of the world’s forest, and this includes our own effort to crack down on trafficking of illegal logged wood and products like the ones illegally deforesting areas around the world. In addition to that, I put in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that we’re going to plant 1.2 billion trees, 1.2 billion trees across this country to begin the vital work of reforesting America. It makes sense and it also makes a big difference, including in our cities and on our city streets.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:56)', 'Speech': 'The executive order also recognizing when it comes to protecting our communities from floods and storms, nature can help us as well. For example, when it comes to stopping flooding, sometimes a wetland is more effective than a sea wall. I live along a state where it’s only the average three feet above sea level, the state of Delaware, the Delaware River, the Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. Well, you saw what happened, by the way, down in the Gulf. You saw what happened in Louisiana, when they had that… It matters whether or not there’s a wetlands. They’re significantly more consequential than sea walls. In order to help bring more of those nature-based solutions into our planning, we have to move quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (28:33)', 'Speech': 'And with this executive order on Earth Day, we’re also showing this moment of maximum threat and urgency can also be a moment of enormous hope and enormous opportunity, that we carry in heart and mind the image of the ideal place, the right place, the one true home, known or unknown, action or visionary. I know you all feel it. You wouldn’t be sitting here in the cold with your coats you’ve got on not if you didn’t. So I’m now going to sign this executive order, and I think we’re going to make… I just think this is the beginning of a new day, and we’re going to just have to overtake the opposition on this. I really mean it. So thank you all for being here. I’m going to sign this executive order.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:15)', 'Speech': 'Strengthening the nation’s forest communities and local economies, and it’s all about planting about a billion and 200 million trees, so. And by the way, anybody bring their shovels? All right. Is this a state park or is this a city park?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (29:52)', 'Speech': 'City.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (29:52)', 'Speech': 'City park.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:53)', 'Speech': 'Mr. Mayor.'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Bruce Harrell: (29:54)', 'Speech': 'Yes, sir.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (29:54)', 'Speech': 'It’s my tribal land.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:55)', 'Speech': 'Let me give this over [crosstalk 00:29:57].'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Bruce Harrell: (29:57)', 'Speech': 'Right here, right here.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (29:58)', 'Speech': 'Right here.

I feel like I’m at home.'}, {'Time': 'Miguel Cardona: (04:11)', 'Speech': 'You probably don’t know this, but Mr. Russell and I share some things in common. We both became teachers in the communities that raised us. We both remember the profound impact that teachers of color had on us when we were children.

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Secretary Cardona. And welcome to the White House. As I was reading through your stories, I was so impressed by the innovation and creativity that all of you bring to your classrooms every day. Kurt Russell, our National Teacher of the Year, helps students find a sense of self worth by dressing for success. Autumn Rivera from Colorado helped her students join a campaign to save a local lake. Jared Kepp, where are you? Has helped his Native American students explore their tribal culture and history. And the stories go on and on.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (07:59)', 'Speech': 'But I also know that what makes your work special isn’t just the projects or presentations. It’s not the curriculum or the classroom tactics. It’s that smile that tells students that they don’t have to be afraid to say and answer out loud. It’s the calm in your voice that can still the wild horses running through their hearts. It’s the way that you know that sometimes, ” I’m fine” means everything is wrong. It’s how they know that you’re telling the truth when you say, “It’s okay. We’re going to figure this out together.”'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (08:45)', 'Speech': 'What makes your work so special is you, the love and the joy that you bring to it, the empathy and the understanding, the sheer power of your presence. You do this work because it’s a part of who you are, because you have a calling. And you’re not alone. Somewhere listening is a college student who grew up teaching her younger brothers and sisters and knows that she has a gift, a young man who took an education class and something just clicked for the first time. There’s an artist who wants to spread the joy of creating something out of nothing.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (09:37)', 'Speech': 'They have a calling, too, to show students an entirely new world in science or history or art to guide them through uncharted paths, to change someone’s life forever in big, red letter moments and small acts of kindness. To them I want to say, “Listen to that call. Join us. Yes, you. You can change the world one student at a time. And we need you. We need more teachers.” I can’t promise that it will be an easy job, right? But I can promise that it will fill your life with meaning and purpose and joy. My own grandmother was a teacher in a small town in New Jersey, and she loved her work and her students loved her in return. And just like you might see in the movies, she used to call her students to class with a big brass bell. And when she died, she didn’t leave behind a giant estate. But what I inherited from her and what I still have to this day is that bell. And I sometimes think about the way her legacy resonated into the world like waves of sound, changing those who heard its ring. I think of every student she taught and every child who she inspired and wonder what amazing things they grew up to do.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (11:43)', 'Speech': 'Perhaps they are public servants working to make our communities a little stronger, a little fairer. Perhaps they are doctors saving lives or architects building our cities or scientists working to solve global challenges. And of course, there’s at least one teacher. Today, all of you, ring your own bell, pulling each person you teach into a harmony that never ends.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (12:15)', 'Speech': 'Right now, someone out there is a better thinker because of you. Someone is standing a little taller because you helped her find the confidence that she needed. Someone is working a little harder because you pushed him to try.

Thank you, Dr. Biden, for your strong leadership and your efficacy towards education for more equitable education, as well. Secretary Cardona, thank you for your effort and your service and your leadership. To my Ohio delegate, thank you so much. Miss Angela [Dickey 00:14:40], my state coordinator. Mr. [Brent Betz 00:14:43], my principal. My superintendent, Mister … Dr. David Hall, forgive me, and my state superintendent, as well, Dr. Stephanie [Sidis 00:14:53]. So thank you, as well. I would like to say thank you Oberlin City Schools and for their tireless effort in supporting me, my Oberlin family. A special and most important thank you to my beautiful wife, Donna, who is here, and my two sons, KJ, Kurt Junior, we call him KJ, and Corey, and to my mother and my in-laws, as well. So it’s just a pleasure to be here with you.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (15:28)', 'Speech': 'A special thank you to the most distinguished, talented, amazing group of educators assembled in one place, the 2022 State Teachers of the Year. Allow me to give you a hand. You are truly, truly amazing and I look forward to learning from you and taking this journey together. When I look at your, I see your desire to improve the lives of your students. I am humbled and honored to represent you, along with the thousands of hardworking educators throughout this nation, who believe in a rich, fulfilling education for all students.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (16:25)', 'Speech': 'Especially during this past two years, I have personally witnessed teachers pour into their students unwavering kindness, love, and hope. Being here today makes me think of my colleague and good friend, [Danita 00:16:42], who has touched countless children’s lives with her caring approach to teaching. Each day, she gives her time in investing in every child that crosses her path by giving out hugs to students who are having a difficult time or even something simple as a granola bar to students who are hungry.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (17:06)', 'Speech': 'Danita epitomizes what great teaching is, cheering, rooting, and being invested in the wholeness of the child. Each student needs a champion, no matter what the circumstances are. Each morning, parents give us their most precious gifts, their children. Parents have placed trust that we nurture, cultivate, and help students find personal meaning and purpose in their lives. School is where dreams come alive. It has been teachers who have laid the foundations of possibilities.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (17:51)', 'Speech': 'It was my kindergarten teacher, Miss [Toss 00:17:54], Miss Francine Toss. I still vaguely remember my first day of kindergarten. I was greeted by Miss Toss, a middle-aged white woman with a huge smile and a gentle voice. She welcomed each student to her class and, like all teachers on the first day, tried to ease the nervousness of her students.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (18:17)', 'Speech': 'The school year was great. Miss Toss made learning enjoyable, fun, and she created a learning environment in which you felt as though you were the only one in the classroom. Her lessons were meaningful and heartfelt and one could tell she enjoyed teaching, but more importantly, Miss Toss intentionally incorporated an inclusive curriculum. She read books by black authors and women authors and made sure that all students felt a sense of belonging.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (18:52)', 'Speech': 'It was also my eighth grade math teacher, Mr. Larry Thomas, the first black male teacher I ever had. Mr. Thomas wore an afro, was an impeccable dresser, and he wore a shirt and tie every single day. When I looked at him, I saw a professional. This provided me with the attainable goal of becoming a teacher. In him, I could see myself.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (19:25)', 'Speech': 'As I reflect on the lessons that I learned from Miss Toss and Mr. Thomas, I realize that teaching has to be learner-centered. Students must see themselves in the classrooms and the curriculum in order to empower and to engage. That’s why I created courses that allow students to feel value, courses that deals with women’s rights, gay rights, and also a survey of black history. It’s important that my students see themselves as I see them, with unlimited potential and full of gifts.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (20:07)', 'Speech': 'As our 2022 National Teacher of the Year, I am committed to uplifting the wonderful work of educators. I am truly blessed to be a part of a profession that transforms and legitimize student forces and plant the groundwork for a more culturally responsive education. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (21:04)', 'Speech': 'I am now honored to introduce someone who knows the power of education, a man who is proudly married to a lifelong educator, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:19)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:21:19].'}, {'Time': 'Kurt Russell: (21:30)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, sir.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:34)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Thank you, Kurt. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Secretary Cardona, thank you. And I want to thank Jill. Jill is the nation’s first first lady to work full-time as a professor, as a teacher. She taught high school and she teaches at community college for a long time now. We made a deal that she’s so … Teaching is not what Jill does, it’s who she is, like most of you, who you are, what you believe. And so when we got elected to presidency and as vice president, as well, I suggested and she agreed fully that she should continue to teach. People said, “What?” Well, she teaches 14 credits a semester, community college, full-time, and she does her job. I’m very, very supportive of teachers for a number of reasons. Some of them are personal, but if I didn’t support teachers, I’d be sleeping alone in one of these bedrooms up here. Before I begin the formal comments, one of the things that Jill reminded me when she spoke … I’ll bet all of you can give examples, as well. I got lucky. I won the lottery, in terms of parents. My mother and father are wonderful people. I had one of those moms that everybody wished had been their mom, for real. Everybody hung at my house.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:11)', 'Speech': 'But I also was a bit of a runt, in terms of my size, and I used to talk like this. I stuttered badly. And when you stutter, everyone thinks you have to be either stupid or totally incompetent. And if you notice, it’s the only infirmity a child can talk about, an adult can talk about having had, but people … you didn’t because you’re teachers, think they can laugh, think it’s funny.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:47)', 'Speech': 'If you saw the movie King’s Speech, you understand. We went to see it, Jill and I, and right as the king was standing at the racetrack making the speech, she reached over. I guess I’d tightened up somehow. It brought back home all the memories. And I look back on it now and I wonder, besides I really got lucky with my parents, my mother would say, “Look at me, Joey. Look at me. You’re smart [inaudible 00:24:16]. You’re this, you’re that. So stop. You can do this.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:20)', 'Speech': 'My point is this, that I had teachers … I can name the ones through grade school, high school, and even college. I didn’t really beat my stuttering. Still, occasionally I do, until I took speech, the big class in college. I forced myself to be able to stand up. When they sent me the copy, the guy who wrote the King’s Speech found the original speech and made a copy of it and sent it to me, from the movie. And he does the speeches exactly like I did, which a nun taught me. If you took a look at my speech, you’ll see that there’s all these slash marks in the speech because an awful lot of people who are … I can’t sing worth a damn, but the people, entertainers and singers, can sing like a nightingale, but can’t talk, can’t speak.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:18)', 'Speech': 'I look back on my life and I think beyond my family, my sister, my brother, my mom, my dad. The people who made a difference in my life in a fundamental way were teachers. I remember I was talking on the way over to this. My staff is going, “Why aren’t you giving the speech we wrote?” I truly remember, and we were talking about it on the way over, what got me involved in politics. I got involved into politics because I think the greatest sin that anyone can commit is the abuse of power, whatever that power is, the power of a teacher, the power of a doctor, the power of a …'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:03)', 'Speech': '… the power of a teacher, the power of a doctor, the power of a leader. When someone who is relying on you, or you cannot… Just the abuse of power. And I got involved because my state was the only state in the union when Dr. King was murdered, that was occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with drawn bayonets in every corner, because we had a very conservative governor who ordered the National Guard. And because my state is the eighth largest black population in America, as a percent of population. And I had a job of one of the oldest law firms in the state, and I quit and became a public defender. That’s what got me involved.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:41)', 'Speech': 'But again, where teachers come in, I had no intention of running for public office. Everybody thought Biden knew he wanted to be president at the time he was in sixth grade or something. I love these biographies, but here’s the deal. What I did do, I wanted to get engaged. And so we had a very, very conservative Democratic party in my state. And I thought it was wrong on civil rights. The more progressive party was the Republican party, because we were a Southern Democratic party. We were a slave state to our great shame early on. We fought on the side of the north like Maryland did and two other states, but we were a border state and that’s what got me going.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:26)', 'Speech': 'And so I was asked by a group of senior lawyers, whether or not I joined a thing called a New Democratic Coalition. And the reason I bothered to tell you that was how to reform the party, how to bring it into the 21st century and the 20th century at the time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:43)', 'Speech': 'And one day after being asked to see if I could help recruit someone to run for the United States Senate against a very popular Republican Senator, a group of Senator, a former Senator, a former Congressman, two former governors came to me and said, “We want you to run.” And I wasn’t even old enough. I was 29 years old and I thought this is crazy. But I remember going home from that convention. And the first stop I made was to speak to a professor named Dr. Ingersol, who was one of those professors who was my philosophy professor in political science.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (28:24)', 'Speech': 'And I stopped him and I told him what was going on. And he looked at me and I’ll not forget what he said. He said, “You should do it.” I said, “I can’t do that.” I never even knew anybody who was in the Senate. And he looked at me, he said, “Remember what Plato said.” I’ll paraphrase what he said. The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse themselves. But my generic point is this. He gave me the confidence as a 29 year old kid with no money to run.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:05)', 'Speech': 'He gave me the confidence. Just like the nun would tell me, “Joey, Joey, you can do this.” They gave me the confidence. And I think about it. You’re going to think about 20 years from now, how did you end up standing on the podium in the White House? No, you didn’t ever expect that. I wonder how I got here. I got here because of my parents and my teachers. My teachers. And so folks, that idea is exemplified by the National Teacher of the Year. Kurt, you have and I have something in common though. I was an adjunct professor in law school for years, teaching an advanced course in separation of powers. And I taught to get money when I was at Syracuse Law School to get through law school. I was a substitute teacher. You should be nicer to them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (30:20)', 'Speech': 'But that’s not what Kurt and I have in common. We have in common is we both married women who are smarter than we are. This is an assistant dean at Overland College. One of the finest colleges in the country. Kurt teaches history, taught 25 years. In fact, he teaches the same town, the same district he grew up in. And by the way, when I left the vice presidency, I had a chance to do a number of things. But I became a professor at University of Pennsylvania in presidential politics. And I enjoyed it, but it’s hard. That’s the other thing people don’t realize. It’s hard. How much you prepare.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:12)', 'Speech': 'I had a three credit course I taught in law school. I would literally every single… I didn’t want to do it during the week because I didn’t want people to say I’m taking away from my job as a senator. I did it on Saturdays at Delaware Law School. I would prepare, Jill will tell you, three to four hours before every class. And it was what not only I taught, but what I did as chairman of the judiciary committee, I taught about separation of powers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:42)', 'Speech': 'It was what I did my whole life and it took me all that time. But the point is, it really mattered. I love what this guy said in his classroom about, he said, “We listen to each other and respect people’s opinion.” Well, part of this is all about fundamentally teaching respect. While we might be in the opposite sides of hot topics, we’re in the same side in terms of having respect for one another. Kurt, I understand you wanted to go back home to be a teacher because your teachers inspired you. I’ll bet every one of you can name one or two teachers who fundamentally impacted your lives. Well, I think you’ve paid it forward many times over, old buddy, and transforming the lives of your students in Overland, Ohio. Helping students see themselves in you. That’s what happens, I think. And helping all your students, not only learn history, but see that they have a role in shaping history. I mean, in a literal sense.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (32:54)', 'Speech': 'And Delaware Teacher of the Year. Where were you, [Josha 00:33:01]? Where’s my [inaudible 00:33:02]? I got to admit we’re the second smallest state, but I’m a little prejudice on behalf of this state. I know there are a lot of eighth graders at Brandy Wine who are feeling confident and more comfortable because of your help. Jill taught at the same school when she was in Delaware, at Brandy Wine High School. And even though teacher appreciation week officially starts next week, I wanted to get it started earlier. It’s an honor for me and First Lady and Secretary Cardona to recognize the teachers of the year from 50 different states. And it really is something we look forward. I did a eulogy today for a brilliant woman, on the former secretary of state. And I sat in the front row with two other presidents who were also there to honor her.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (34:02)', 'Speech': 'And I told them what I was doing. And they all talked about how much they enjoyed the years they were here for the Teacher the Year affair. Over the past two years ago, the entire country’s has witnessed an extraordinary dedication and resolve on our nation’s teachers. Early in the pandemic, teachers and teacher’s aides had to not just be educators. You had to be tech support. You had to be moral support. You had to be health support. I mean, you had to take care of your own children in addition, and I watched how hard it was, how really hard. There was so much heroic work to help kids connect, get connected to schools and just the socialization that they were missing in so many places were so long. It’s estimated they’re five to seven months behind their education right now. The American people saw it. Because guess what? When you’re taught remotely from home, the moms and dads understood what you were doing. And they know and they realized how damn hard it is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:07)', 'Speech': 'I’m serious. I think it was… My mother used to say out of everything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it. I think that was the upside. American people became, whoa, my goodness. And they understand what you’ve been saying for years, that you’re professional, all of you. All of you have a responsibility to make sure you have what you need. And we have a responsibility to make sure you have what you need to educate our children safely. So they have a chance, chance to achieve dreams, dreams they don’t even know they have. They don’t even know they have. That’s why I made it a priority to get educators vaccinated and reopen our schools as quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:58)', 'Speech': 'We made a historic commitment to our schools, $ 130 billion in the Rescue Plan, $130 billion. It helped us go from 50% of our schools being closed and 99% of our schools open and safe, better heating, air conditioning, ventilation systems, safer buildings. It isn’t a thriving building until it comes alive though with teachers and students. With the help of the American Rescue Plan, local governments are able to, as the state officials here can tell you in education, were able to add a record 270,000 new educators in 2021. Another 50,000 jobs, teaching jobs in the first months of 2022. In January, compared to the period before the pandemic, schools have increased their number of social workers by 65%, counselors by 17%. You’re expected to do everything. You’re expected to not only teach. You’re expected to be a guidance counselor yourself, but you’re also expected to deal with the problems that they have at home. You see it. You can see in their faces when they walk into school.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (37:17)', 'Speech': 'And Jill said, just by the way they answer their questions and questions about how they’re doing, how they’re feeling, and you need help. You need social workers. You need school psychologists and psychiatrists. You need that kind of help. And the American Rescue Plan funds are especially important, now that we see the impact this pandemic exacted on our children. As I said, students lost months of learning in particularly reading and math. It’s not just academic skills they’ve fallen behind on. Teachers have seen young children struggle to interact in group settings, to manage conflict, to take turns. They got a lot of learning to make up, and we’re doing everything we can to help you. I want input from you as well, because we have a lot of teachers. We seek their input. Using the funds from the American Rescue Plan, schools are providing and expanding summer learning. Summer learning and tutoring programs to give students extra time and attention they need to catch up and develop those fundamental math and reading skills.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (38:23)', 'Speech': 'You all know if you get far behind in first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh grade, it takes a lot of time to make. And if you lose your confidence, it even gets harder. So I urge more states, counties, and cities and towns to use their American Rescue Plan funding, which is in the billions of dollars, to hire more teachers, more tutors, more critical personnel in our schools. Now, we have an opportunity to make even more game changing investments for educators, students, and families. We’re in competition for leading the 21st century. Not a joke. That’s where we are right now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (39:01)', 'Speech': 'That’s where we are right now. Parenthetically, if you think about it, what was the reason why we led the world beginning around 1905, ’06 and ’07 and ’08? Because we became the first nation in the world to have universal education of one through 12 for everybody, no matter what. Without cost. Well, guess what? If we were sitting down today deciding we were going to set up an education system, raise your hand if any of you think 12 years is enough in the 21st century. Just 12 years. Things are moving too rapidly. They’re changing exponentially. As Jill said, any country that now educates us is going to out compete us. It’s that basic. We have to build the 21st century because the rest of the world isn’t waiting. We have to build for it. One of the tough images of the pandemic was children sitting in their cars with their mother or dad or older brother or sister in the McDonald’s parking lot because that’s the only way they could get on WiFi to do their homework. This is the United States of America for God’s sake. The United States of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (40:18)', 'Speech': 'We didn’t know before. We know now. High speed internet is essential. That’s why we’re spending tens of billions of dollars to make sure that we have high speed internet available to everyone, rural America, inner city America, suburban America, throughout every single school district in America. That’s part of the whole legislation we passed in terms of infrastructure. Starting now, it’s going to create millions of jobs as well for real, but again, we’ve got to get in the 21st century. We’ve got to move. The budget I proposed, supports schools, supports students and supports you to bridge the gap between under-resourced schools and their wealthier counterparts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (41:06)', 'Speech': 'We’re proposing a $19 billion increase in title I schools, and mostly, historically in underfunded schools in our nation, we’ve got to let them catch up. That investment would more than double the current funding in title I schools. Also, proposing the largest increase in special education funding in two decades. We made the promise. We’ve never fulfilled it. We’ve got to fulfill it. Going to add another billion dollar commitment with the goal of doubling the number of social workers, school counselors, and school nurses in K through 12. By the way, thanks to the American rescue plan for making real progress toward that goal, and to support you, the educators. My budget includes $610 million increase teacher diversity, effectiveness and retention.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (42:11)', 'Speech': 'As all of you know, it takes time to become a teacher, the teachers you are today, but nearly one in 10 teachers leave the profession every year with the youngest teachers being the most likely ones to leave first. We’ve got to invest in ways to keep them in the profession. This year, my administration helped over 150 public servants, including teachers get… 150,000 get school forgiveness loans for college loans Through changes we made in the public service loan forgiveness program. The last team kind of messed it up. We’ve cleared it up. No, but I really mean it. Anyway, just go to that website to learn how these changes can benefit you, and I encourage you to go to studenta.go, and you’re going to find you can have, in many of your cases, your entire student debt wiped out because you are teaching and that’s considered a vital profession. One more thing. It’s not enough to give teachers praise. We ought to give you a raise. I have to really listen to you, which I know Senator Cardona has been doing, and we should stand up for you. We should have your back. Teaching is one of the hardest jobs in this country to be able to do it well, and one of the most important. Today, there are too many politicians trying to score political points, trying to ban books, even Math books. Did you ever think, even you younger teachers, did you ever think when you’d be teaching, you’d be worrying about book burnings and banning books, all because it doesn’t fit somebody’s political agenda? American teachers have dedicated their lives to teaching our children and lifting them up. We’ve got to stop making the target of the culture wars. That’s where this is going. Let me close with this because I know a thing about teachers. I know that some of you were probably grading papers on the way here. By the way, Jill traveled with me around the world. I’d say, “Jill, leave the bank book.” By the way, how many are Math teachers? Raise your hand. She envies the hell out of you. She thinks your job’s easier. You just, you’ve got to check the answer. She teaches writing, but she gets off the plane. Am I joking? With up to 50, 60 papers she’s grading on Air Force One.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (44:59)', 'Speech': 'I said, Jill. She’s walking down the hill. You think I’m kidding. I’m not kidding with you. This is deadly earnest. Many of you are trying to figure out, if you’re have class tomorrow, you may be here for tomorrow, but on Monday, are you ready for your class? Are you prepared? Do you have your lesson plan together? We always talk about these children. They’re not someone else’s children. They’re our children and they are the kite strings that literally lift our national ambitions aloft in a literal sense. Think about it. If you’ve got to do one thing to make sure the nation succeeded in the next two generations, what would you do?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (45:49)', 'Speech': 'You’d want, I would say, literally have the best educated public in the world. Have our students gain confidence enough to know what they can do to reach in. We have an obligation. We have an obligation to help them teach and reach their potential. You’ve heard me say it many times about our children, but it’s true. They’re all our children. The reason you’re the teachers of the years is because you recognize that. They’re not somebody else’s children. They’re like yours when they’re in the classroom. You represent a profession that helps them gain the confidence, the confidence they believe they can do anything. Again, think of your own lives. Think of where you gained the confidence beyond your family. God willing, you’re able to. You know what else we’re finding out? We’re having a big fight about it now, but I’m going to get it done eventually or someone will.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (46:49)', 'Speech': 'That is that we’ve learned now, you all know those who, if you are in a teaching profession, know that if you come from a broken home or a home with a single parent and maybe a drug problem or something, for a very poor home, you’re going to end up hearing a million words, fewer words spoken by the time you get to first grade than from a kid coming from an average middle class home. Not in different words. Just words spoken, because they’re not engaged. Also, we learned that, if in fact, you have kids go to school at three years old and four years old and five years old, you increase exponentially by 57% the likelihood they will make it no matter what their background, all the way through 12 years of school and probably on. It matters. It matters. For that and so much more that you do, you believe in these kids. I know some of them are really difficult. I get it, but you believe in them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (47:59)', 'Speech': 'You know when they know you believe in them, they believe in you. Thank you for what you do. If I get to have one profession that’s the best in the world, not a joke, it’s you I want to be the best profession in the world because you affect what this country looks like. What it’ll act like, what it’ll be like. A success or failure more than any other group of Americans, period. Thank for what you do. Keep it going. I promise you, Jill has your back and mind. Thank you very much.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 8: (48:51)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats while the President and First Lady depart.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 9: (48:52)', 'Speech': 'Are you honored that Delaware represented, Mr. President?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (48:52)', 'Speech': 'Thank you all.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 9: (48:52)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 10: (49:55)', 'Speech': 'What’s your response to [inaudible 00:49:55] from Poland?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 7: (49:55)', 'Speech': 'All right, guys.

You know, there’s a dinner this weekend to celebrate the press. Think of what the American press has done; the courage it’s taken to stay in these war zones, the courage it’s taken to report every single day. I’ve always had respect for the press, but I can’t tell you how much respect I have watching them in these zones where they’re under fire, risking their own lives to make sure the world hears the truth.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:18)', 'Speech': 'Imagine if we weren’t getting that information.

And it begins to transition to longer term security systems that’s going to help Ukraine to deter and continue to defend against Russian aggression.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:25)', 'Speech': 'This assistance would provide even more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armored systems, anti-air capabilities that have been used so effectively thus far in the battlefield by the Ukrainian warriors.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:38)', 'Speech': 'And it’s going to deliver much needed humanitarian assistance, as well as food, water, medicine, shelter, and other aid to Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war, and provide aid for those seeking refuge in other countries from Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:53)', 'Speech': 'It’s also going to help schools and hospitals open. It’s going to allow pensions and social support to be paid to the Ukrainian people so they have something in their pocket. It’s also going to provide critical resources to address food shortages around the globe.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:09)', 'Speech': 'Ukraine was one of the world’s largest agricultural producers and typically grows 10% of all the wheat that’s shipped around the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:17)', 'Speech': 'Putin has asserted sanctions are blocking food from Ukraine and Russia getting on the market; the sanctions we’ve imposed on Russia. Simply not true. Putin’s war, not sanctions, are impacting the harvest of food and disrupting the movement of that food by land and sea to nations around the globe that need it.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:40)', 'Speech': 'This funding is going to help ease rising food prices at home as well and abroad caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. It’s going to help support American farmers produce more crops like wheat and oil seed, which is good for rural America, good for the the American consumer, and good for the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:59)', 'Speech': 'And this supplemental request will use the Defense Production Act to expand domestic production and the reserve of critical materials; materials like nickel and lithium that have been disrupted by Putin’s war in Ukraine, and that are necessary to make everything from defense systems to automobiles.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:20)', 'Speech': 'And I hope Congress will move on this funding quickly. I believe they will.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:25)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank Congress, Democrats and Republicans, for their support of the people of Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:30)', 'Speech': 'And next week, I will be in Alabama to visit Lockheed Martin plant that manufactures the Javelin anti-tank missile we have been sending to Ukraine, and to thank the American workers, thank them for producing the weapons that help stop Russia’s advances in Ukraine in cities like Kyiv. Their hard work has played a critical role in ensuring Putin’s strategic failure in Ukraine, and they should know that we know it.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:56)', 'Speech': 'In addition to this supplemental funding, I’m also sending to Congress a comprehensive package that will enhance our underlying effort to accommodate the Russian oligarchs and make sure we take their ill-begotten gains. We’re going to accommodate them. We’re going to seize their yachts, their luxury homes, and other ill-begotten gains of Putin’s kleptocracy, the guys who are the kleptocracy.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:30)', 'Speech': 'But these are bad guys. This legislative package strengthens our law enforcement capabilities to seize property linked to Russia’s kleptocracy.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:40)', 'Speech': 'It’s going to create new expedited procedures for forfeiture and seizure of these properties. And it’s going to ensure that, when the oligarch’s assets are sold off, funds can be used directly to remedy the harm Russia caused and help rebuild Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:57)', 'Speech': 'Additionally, yesterday, Russia threatened two of our allies with a cutoff of energy supplies. While America has ended all Russian fossil fuel imports, because we’re able to use our vast supply of power in our country, some European countries have faced more challenges in reducing their reliance on Russian fuel.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:18)', 'Speech': 'Russia has long claimed to be “the reliable source of energy for the world.” No matter what the differences are, their customers are always going to be in good shape.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:30)', 'Speech': 'But these actions prove that energy is not just a commodity that Russia sells to help meet other countries’ needs, but a weapon used to deploy against those who stand against their aggression.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:41)', 'Speech': 'Let me be clear. We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions. We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression. We’re working with other nations like Korea, Japan, [inaudible 00:09:56] and others to support our effort to help European allies threatened by Russia with gas blackmail and their energy needs in other ways.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:05)', 'Speech': 'Aggression will not win. Threats will not win. This is just another reminder of the imperative for Europe and the world to move more and more of our power needs to clean energy.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:18)', 'Speech': 'In the United States, we’re doing that right now. Last year, we developed more solar, wind and battery storage than any year in our history, enough to power 56 million American homes.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:30)', 'Speech': 'Earlier this month, we acted to bolster our reliance on our nuclear energy facilities, which generates more than half of our carbon free power. And we’re just getting started.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:42)', 'Speech': 'I look at this as a serious problem, but also an enormous opportunity. An opportunity.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:48)', 'Speech': 'Bottom line, all these actions we’ve been taking are about this truth: investing in Ukraine’s freedom and security is a small price to pay to punish Russian aggression, to lessen the risk of future conflicts.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': 'You know, throughout our history, we’ve learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression. They keep moving, and the cost, the threats to America and the world keep rising.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:19)', 'Speech': 'We can’t let this happen. Our unity at home, our unity with our allies and partners, and our unity with the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: “You will never succeed in dominating Ukraine.”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:35)', 'Speech': 'Finally, we’re going to continue to deliver critical support to Ukraine. We must also not let our guard down in our fight against COVID-19 at home and abroad.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:45)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I’m, again, urging Congress to act on my request for 22.5 billion dollars in emergency resources so the American people can continue to protect themselves from COVID-19.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:58)', 'Speech': 'The reason we were so successful in the past is because I was able to work with drug manufacturers to order significant quantities of material we needed ahead of time to get in the front of the line. Without additional funding, we can’t pre-order the amount of vaccines we need, and we risk losing our spot in line for vaccines that target multiple variants.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:20)', 'Speech': 'We’re running out of supply for therapeutics like antiviral pills that we desperately need. Without additional funding, we’re unable to purchase the life saving treatment for the American people.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:32)', 'Speech': 'We’ve donated more vaccines and treatments to the world than all other nations in the world combined. If the US won’t do it, no one else is really going to step up and do it. Without additional funding, the United States won’t be able to help stop the spread around the world and close off ongoing sources of the supply chain disruptions.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:54)', 'Speech': 'Look, let’s get both of these critical tasks done. No delays, no excuses. Just action. Now. Now. Thank you all.

Fly directly to the United States. We set up a mechanism whereby they can come directly with a visa.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:53)', 'Speech': '[crosstalk 00:13:53]'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (13:53)', 'Speech': 'How worried are you by the growing number of Russian comments and their media and some of their officials painting this conflict as actually already a conflict between NATO, the US and Russia. They’re painting it in very alarmist terms, talking nuclear weapons, saying it’s a life or death struggle, et cetera.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:09)', 'Speech': 'And just separately … Well, connected to that; Lavrov himself says it’s already a proxy war. Not a direct war, but a proxy war.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:17)', 'Speech': 'So are either of those two things true? And do they worry you, those things?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:22)', 'Speech': 'They’re not true. They do concern me because it shows the desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do in the first instance. And so I think it’s more of a reflection, not of the truth, but of their failure.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:41)', 'Speech': 'And so instead of saying that the Ukrainians equipped with some capability to resist Russian forces are doing this, they’ve got to tell their people the United States and all of NATO is engaged in taking out Russian troops and tanks, et cetera.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:03)', 'Speech': 'So number one, it’s an excuse for their failure, but number two, it’s also, if they really mean it, no one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons or the possibility they’d use that. It’s irresponsible.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:24)', 'Speech': '[crosstalk 00:15:24]'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (15:24)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, back on the border; Title 42, a number of your democratic friends are pressuring the White House to maintain that policy. Can you give us a straight answer whether they’re going to heed that request or you’re going to get rid of it?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:40)', 'Speech': 'I can give you a straight answer. We had proposed to eliminate that policy by the end of May. The court has said we can’t so far, and what the court says, we’re going to do. The court could come along and say we cannot do that. And that’s it.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:57)', 'Speech': '[crosstalk 00:15:57]'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 5: (15:57)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, you say that this is not a proxy war, but Russia clearly disagrees. They say that war means war. So how concerned are you that they may start to act accordingly, even if you disagree?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:08)', 'Speech': 'We are prepared for whatever they do.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (16:11)', 'Speech': 'What options do you have to ensure Poland and Bulgaria have sufficient supplies of gas?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:16)', 'Speech': 'First of all, as you know, Poland has indicated they have significant reserves of gas that they have planned for, as does, not as much, but as does Bulgaria. And we have worked with our allies from Japan on to say that we may divert our sale of the natural gas that we’re sending to those countries and divert it directly to Poland and Bulgaria.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:42)', 'Speech': 'So that’s as much I can tell you right now.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 7: (16:46)', 'Speech': 'Sir, how concerned are you about a recession, given the GDP report today showed a contraction of 1.4% in the fourth quarter?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:54)', 'Speech': 'Well, I’m not concerned about a recession. I mean, you’re always concerned about a recession, but …'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:01)', 'Speech': 'The GDP fell to 1.4%, but here’s the deal. We also had, last quarter, consumer spending and business investment and residential investment increased at significant rates, both for leisure as well as hard products. Number one.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:19)', 'Speech': 'Number two, unemployment is at the lowest rate since 1970. A record 4.5 million businesses were created last year. We’re in a situation where we have a very different view than Senator Scott of the Republicans who want to raise taxes on the middle class families and want to include half the small business owners in that.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:45)', 'Speech': 'So I think what you’re seeing is enormous growth in the country that was affected by everything from COVID and the COVID blockages that we occurred along the way.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:58)', 'Speech': 'Now, you always have to take a look, and no one is predicting a recession now. Some are predicting there may be a recession and 2023.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:10)', 'Speech': 'I’m concerned about it, but I know one thing; that, you know, if our Republican friends are really interested in doing something about dealing with economic growth, they should help us continue to lower the deficit, which we’ve done last year; over 350 billion dollars. They should be willing to work with us to have a tax code that is actually one that works and everybody pays their fair share. And they should be in a position where you shouldn’t be raising taxes on middle class folks, you should be raising taxes on people who … Everyone acknowledges that the vast majority of Republicans aren’t paying their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:50)', 'Speech': 'I’ve said it a hundred times. You have 50 major corporations of the Fortune 500 companies made 40 billion dollars last year; didn’t pay a single penny. No one under our proposal, and again, $400,000 a year, will see a penny in their taxes go up. Not one penny.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (19:07)', 'Speech': '[crosstalk 00:19:07].'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 8: (19:07)', 'Speech': 'Do you think COVID and Ukraine should be tied together in legislation?'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (19:14)', 'Speech': 'Well, I don’t care how they do it. I’m sending them both up. I mean, they can do it separately or together, but we need them both.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 9: (19:20)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, Majority Leader Schumer said yesterday that you’re “getting closer to using executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt.”'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 9: (19:30)', 'Speech': 'Can you confirm that?

I’ll get the number. 700 and some thousand have had debt forgiven, their whole debt forgiven, because of their work, working as teachers or other means by which they qualify.

You know, I got a chance to talk with the family a little bit earlier and trying to console them, and I got emotional. But as my grandfather Finny would say, “That’s the Irish in me.” You know, I served with Fritz time. He became a good and close friend. I was a kid when I got elected. I wasn’t even known to be sworn in, I was only 29-years-old. And because everything’s based on seniority in the Senate, I got to hang out with folks like Fritz and Hubert long before you’d ordinarily at my age. Because by the time I was there a second term, I was chairman of some major committees.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:17)', 'Speech': 'And so, I’m going to talk more today about Fritz and what he’d pretend didn’t exist, but Fritz’s sense of empathy. Fritz had a special way about him that I don’t think he would talk about. I could be wrong, but I never heard him talk about it. Now there was a question that Fritz famously asked staffers who came to work for him. He’d say, “On the breakfast plate, what’s the difference between the eggs and the bacon?” Senators Smith and Klobuchar know the answer, by supplying the eggs, the chicken made a contribution, the hog was fully committed. And it always surprised Fritz I knew a little about agriculture. Delaware, my state, has in the Delmarva Peninsula, there’s a $5 billion industry, chickens. A lot of chickens. Hell of a lot more chickens than people. And it’s the biggest industry.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:40)', 'Speech': 'But Fritz was always committed, not merely to the work of his lifetime, which all of you are familiar with. Most people know most of all, everybody who’s blessed to know him in this state. Reverend Hart-Andersen, members of Congress, our military, distinguished guests, most of all, the Mondale family, Ted, William and Rebecca, and Jan. All the grandchildren, Lewis, Amanda, Barrett, Charlotte, Cassandra and Daniel. And all the dear friends of the family that are here as well. Because he always talked about you all as family.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:25)', 'Speech': 'I’m moved to be with you here today as an honorer, one of the great giants in American history, and that’s not hyperbole. Fritz was a giant in American political history, a great American. But he also had a lot of great Americans write about him and write things that related to him without them even knowing it. Great American novelist, Edith Wharton wrote, “There are two ways of spreading light, to be a candle or the mirror that reflects it.” Fritz was both the candle and the mirror, in my view. Candle spreading light and the mirror reflecting it.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:11)', 'Speech': 'And today, I speak of a friend of five decades about that light, the light of friendship and what it meant to me personally and my family. Fritz and I first met at one of the darkest moments of my life. I had not intended to run for the United States Senate. I was involved… My state, to its great shame, was segregated by law. We have the eighth largest Black population in America as a percent of population in Delaware. I got involved in politics indirectly by getting involved in the civil rights movement as a kid, being the only White employee in the East Side of Wilmington, area called The Bucket, for years. And I was asked by a group of senior Democrats would I… I was a young lawyer when I came back from law school. And we were the only city in America occupied by the National Guard for 10 months, with every corner being occupied by a National Guard member with a drawn bayonet, because of Dr. King’s assassination and the riots that took place in my home state.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:29)', 'Speech': 'And I had a job with one of the oldest law firms in the state, a white-shoe as they used to call them, law firm. And after being home for six months, I couldn’t do it anymore. And I left and tried this sort of job as a public defender to represent the people I used to work with as a kid in high school and college. And, so I came to the United States Senate with a passion to do something about civil rights. And when I was elected, I ran initially with a group. I joined a group of senior members of the Delaware Democratic establishment to reform the Democratic Party, because we were more a Southern Democratic Party than a Northeastern Democratic Party. Used to be able to join the Southern Governors’ Conference or the Mid-Atlantic Conference and Democratic governor’s joined the Southern Governors’ Conference. But I couldn’t bring myself to be a Republican, even though they were more progressive because of Richard Nixon, when I registered.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:44)', 'Speech': 'But I was asked to head up a committee of younger people to try to get someone to run for the United States Senate against a guy who was a decent guy actually, a little too conservative, but a decent guy. One thing led to another and I ended up being asked to run for the Senate. I had no intention of running for the Senate. But two years earlier I had been elected to the county council. And Delaware is like a miniature Illinois, one county is 60% of the state’s population. So as a councilperson, I represented a district seven times as large as a state representative and three times as large as a state senator. And I ran and won. I ran only to be a good soldier to try to get out Democrats voting and I wasn’t supposed to win. The only reason I ran, I was certain I wasn’t going to win because I didn’t want to be a county councilman. I was just setting up a law firm as a young senator, as a young man, I should say.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:54)', 'Speech': 'And so what happened was, I won in a district, it was like 55, 56% Republican, no Democrat ever won. Republicans saw something me I didn’t see. They saw someone who may want to go on and run for office beyond that. So they reapportioned me from a four-year term or two-year term in those 65% district. And I was put in the position of up or out, and a group of senior members, a former governor, a former United States senator, a former congressman and the retired chief justice of the Supreme Court whose family had more senators than any family in American history. And they came to me an off year convention. I’ll never forget how classic it was. It was a break in the convention in Dover, Delaware, I was at a little motel nearby to go back and change with the younger people I was with. And I had my own room, the typical kind of, you drive up to the front door, two headboards nailed on the wall, a desk nailed to the other wall and a eight by 10 bathroom. So I was in shaving and I had my towel around me. I had just got out the shower and I was shaving, and this banging at the door. And I thought it was one of those, a guy named Bob Cunningham who was with me. I said, “All right, all right, all right!”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:14)', 'Speech': 'I went to the door and opened the door, there was a former two-term governor, I remember name, [inaudible 00:10:21] Carville, former congressman named Harrison and the state chairman, and a former chief justice. And I’m standing in a towel, shaving on my [inaudible 00:10:34], and the rest of me is stark naked. And I said… They said, “We want to talk to Joe.” So I said, “Well, come in gentlemen.” I ran into the bathroom, take off the shaving cream, hoping I could find something to put on. I had nothing to put on. So I came back out and I leaned against that desk with a towel around, I said, “Yes, gentlemen.” And they said, “Joe, we just had at dinner, we think you should run for the Senate.” And I said, “But.” And the chief justice, former Chief Justice Tunnel said that and I said, “Sir,” I said, “I’m not old enough.” He said, “Joe, you obviously didn’t do very well on constitutional law.” Thinking, “Holy God, what do I do now?” And he said, “You only have to be 30 to be sworn in, they can collect you whenever you want. You’ll be 30, 17 days later.” Well I ran and to the shock and surprise everybody. I won by a staggering 3,100 votes.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:38)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the point. I showed up on December 18th to hire a staff, hadn’t been sworn in yet. And what happened was, that I had gotten a phone call that day from my fire department in Delaware. And they put a poor young woman on the phone who said, “You got to come home, there’s been an accident.” And she went on to tell me, the poor kid had to tell me there was an accident. I said, “What happened?” They said, “Your wife and daughter are dead. And your two boys may not make it.” And you know, the last thing I wanted to do was go to the United States Senate after that. We had elected a governor, a Democrat. He could appoint a Democrat. And I had my brother talking to him about who we’d appoint.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:38)', 'Speech': 'But there was Fritz and Joan, they embraced me, contacted me. That’s not just being nice, but bringing me in. They came to the hospital to see my boys. They helped me find my purpose in a sea of darkness and pain. And a long… I was with Fritz so-'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:03)', 'Speech': 'In pain. I was with Fritz along with Mike Mansfield and Teddy Kennedy and a few others who all came to see me and said, “Just come six months. You can go home after that. We need you.” They had 58 Democrats. They didn’t need me for a damn thing. No serious, but I was such a rookie I thought maybe they need me to organize. And he said, “Then you can leave.” And I used to show up every Tuesday at three o’clock in the Senate chamber to get an assignment from senator Mansfield. Many times Fritz would walk me over. And I thought all freshmen got assignments. I didn’t know nobody gets an assignment in the Senate. Wasn’t until about five months or three months in that I realized that was the case. But they kept me engaged. They helped me get up when it was easy to give up.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:08)', 'Speech': 'My life changed again five years later. No man deserves one great love in his life, let alone two. But I met and married Jill Biden. Had to ask her five times. True. But being a spouse of a senator who was relatively well known because of the celebrity of how I got there and the accident and inheriting two beautiful young boys wasn’t easy. Once again, Fritz and Joan were there, were there spreading the light. Joan was one of the first people to reach out to Jill, and it meant the world to us. It meant the world. You just heard from my friend, John Meachum. Fritz was a master legislative who shone a light on those who needed it most. Whose desire to lift up other stemmed from his youth, from his service as a corporal in the US Army in those early days. Organized for Hubert Humphrey in parts of Minnesota that Democrats didn’t win.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:21)', 'Speech': 'Fritz learned earlier the power bringing people together, and I know that for Fritz, no moment was brighter than when he joined forces, because I was with him, I was just a bit player, with an African American senator from Massachusetts, senator Edward Brook. And I passed the Fair Housing Act. I was in the same side, the same side of the chamber in the back where Fritz was. I remember the look on his face, literally remember the look on his face, opened up neighborhoods diminished by segregation for so long. When the act passed, Fritz spoke in the Senate floor. And he said that quote, “The words justice and fairness will mean more to millions of our fellow Americans than they do… Never meant more to our fellow Americans than they do today.” That was Fritz spreading light, the light of our country to families who had never truly known its warmth.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:26)', 'Speech': 'At every stage of our lives, at every inflection point, Fritz and Joan, I apologize, we say in the Senate, for the point of personal privilege here, but they were there for Jill and me and my family. Not on a political level, but on a personal level. It was true that my first days in the Senate, when I needed help very badly, and it was true in my last days in the Senate as well. In 2008, when Fritz and I had become close friends and sought this council many times, I was asked to join the ticket with Barack Obama. I was, as I usually was, on Amtrak, going home. I commuted every day. They later told me over a million, 200,000 miles on Amtrak. They should name a station or something after me. But all kidding aside, he called me after it was clear he was the defacto nominee. And he said he’d like me to join him on the ticket, at least consider it. Could he do a background check on me? You know, he’d have to do that background check.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:36)', 'Speech': 'And I said, “No, thanks, Barack.” I thought he was just dragging that bloody claw through the Senate, like presidential nominees do to get everybody excited and involved. And Barack told me, “No, no, no. There’s only one other person I’m considering.” I said, “Barack, I don’t want to be vice president.” He said, “Why?” I said, “Because you’re basically just stand by equipment.” And by that time I chaired two major committees, I was fairly influential in the Senate. I said, “I can help you a lot more as a senator. I’ll do everything I can. I’ll campaign throughout the country for you.” Brock asked me, he said, “Look, would you go home and talk it over your family? Just talk it over.” So I did. I called Jill from the train on my cell phone. And when I got home, I was about halfway home when I had gotten the call. And when I got home, I went in and, the first person I called was Fritz before the family gathered in the back porch.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:38)', 'Speech': 'And I asked, I said, “Fritz, what should I do?”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:42)', 'Speech': 'And he went into great detail. I’m serious. As a matter of fact, he sent me a long memorandum he prepared for president Carter when they were deciding how their relationship would work. He told me in essence that the vice presidency holds no inherent power. None. Zero. The vice presidency is merely, and it’s true, a reflection of a relationship with the president of the United States. About seven years ago, I joined Fritz at a forum in his honor at George Washington University. Fritz recounted that his greatest strength wasn’t his expertise in a particular policy area. It was the genuine personal relationship he built with president Jimmy Carter. Relationship built on real affection and trust. They sat down to lunch together every week. Fritz said, “Make sure you get a commitment from Barack, once a week, you have lunch to discuss whatever is on either of your minds.”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (19:49)', 'Speech': 'He was the first vice president to have an office in the West Wing just a few steps away from the oval office. That never happened before. They’re over in the executive office building across the street. That was a true strength of the vice presidency, he said. A strength that Barack and I replicate in our time in office. And what Kamala and I are doing today, and she sends her regards to the whole family. She called me before I got in the plane. It was Fritz who lit the way. At his core Fritz embraced everybody with the belief that everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody. Dignity. Not just the right to vote. Dignity.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (20:38)', 'Speech': 'He was loved by the American people because he reflected the goodness of the American people, especially the people of Minnesota. Every senator wears on his or her sleeve the state they serve. But the love Fritz had for the people of Minnesota ran deeper than that. He loved you all, and you loved him back, it was obvious, because Fritz reflected the very best qualities of this state. The warmth and optimism that you reflect. At every turn Fritz reflected the light of this nation. Who we are and what we can be. He called me when I had said at the inauguration that we are the most unique nation in all of history. We’re the only nation founded on an idea. Every other nation in the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion, race. We’re founded on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, including right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. And it goes on.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (22:02)', 'Speech': 'Fritz believed that in his gut. I watched him every day for over 35 years in the Senate and when he was vice president. He united people, sharing the same light, the same hopes. Even when we disagree he thought that was important. I’ll never forget, on a personal level, what it meant to have a friend like Fritz. Less than four years after losing Eleanor to brain cancer, and just a year after losing Joan, Fritz was there to help me again when Jill and I lost our son Beau to brain cancer after a year in Iraq. I’ll never forget how Fritz affected so much love in and light into our family. Again, at our darkest moments. Nor will I forget coming here to Minneapolis eight years ago to say goodbye to Joan. Most of you remember that Fritz went to the Mayo Clinic for quadruple bypass the very next day. He had delayed the surgery so he could be with all of us to reflect her light, and he put off treating his own heart, because all you know his heart belonged to Joan.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (23:40)', 'Speech': 'As I’ve said many times, I say to the family, seeing your mom and dad together reminded me of that great line from Christopher Marlowe’s poem, come live with me and be my love, and we shall all the pleasures prove. You can tell when a couple has been together a long time, still looks at each other with love, deep love. It’s been said that memory is the power to gather roses in winter. Well Ted and William, your dad blessed you with an endless garden of those memories. And most of all, the memory of two extraordinary loves. A love of more than 58 years he spent together with your mom, and a love of 51 years with your sister Eleanor. In his farewell letter, Fritz wrote that he was eager to rejoin Joan and Eleanor, two unbreakable loves.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (24:52)', 'Speech': 'Jill Biden wanted to do a garden at the vice president’s residence, the picture of which shows on the screen outside here of them standing in front of the residence so that every family that ever had lived there, it was a garden, it was stones and an engraving on each of the stones of the name of the couple and the children. And I called Fritz to tell about it, and he came over to the house and it was a summer day, and he wanted, he said, “Can we go in the house?” I said, “Of course.” He wanted to walk up to the third floor. He walked up to the third floor and then to the end. There are bedrooms on the third floor. And he stopped in front of a door and opened it and just stared. And I knew he was thinking something deep, and I went down the hallway. And a few minutes went by and he came down and he said, “That was Eleanor’s room. I so miss her.” Well, they’re all together now for all time. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an institute-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:03)', 'Speech': 'Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man.” There’s no doubt that the institution of the Senate, the institution of the Vice President reflect the profound legacy of Fritz Mondale. But it’s not a lengthened shadow we see in those place, it’s his light. It’s up to each of us now to reflect that light that Fritz was all about, to reflect Fritz’s goodness and grace, the way he made people feel no matter who you were.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:45)', 'Speech': 'Just imagine what our nation could achieve if we follow Fritz’s example of honor, decency, integrity, literally just the service of the common good. There would be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our reach.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:09)', 'Speech': 'I hope we all can be Fritz’s mirror. Continue to spread his light, because you know he was one of the finest men you’ve ever known, the most decent people ever dealt with, and one of the toughest, smartest men I’ve ever worked with. You were lucky to have had him, and by the look of things, he was lucky to have had you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:39)', 'Speech': 'God bless you, my dear friend, among the greatest of all Americans. The highest compliment, my grandfather figured, he used to say, you can give a man or woman, he was the Irish of it, was to say, “He’s a good man.” Fritz Mondale was a good man.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (28:23)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ted and William Mondale, the sons of former Vice President Walter Mondale.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (28:43)', 'Speech': 'Try following that. Good afternoon. My job is to thank folks that helped with us today and have been around my dad for a long time. Every one of you that is here is here because you had a piece or a role in his life, and I don’t think anybody would like me thanking 1200 people.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (29:07)', 'Speech': 'But I’d like to say, Mr. President, your presence here today meant everything to our family, I know to him. You know he’s watching Gerry Ferraro’s with him. They probably had Campion go out and get pizza to watch this thing.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (29:28)', 'Speech': 'But thank you so much. It means a lot. Your last call to him right before he passed really helped him move on. He had such a smile on his face. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (29:47)', 'Speech': 'To the speakers, you made this absolutely … You all knew him, but you made it absolutely a service that he would’ve wanted. He didn’t want to lay in state. He didn’t want to be in Washington. He wanted to be here with you. You reflected what he would care about and who he is, and we thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (30:16)', 'Speech': 'To our organizing committee, this is our third go at this event, but we put in countless hours of trying to plan this and do it in a way that would make sense and didn’t last five hours, which would’ve been easy to do. I want to thank the University of Minnesota for hosting us, and the great staff and volunteers that worked tirelessly. Mr. President, they got the building at 2:00 AM and had it set up at 7:00 AM. That’s a bad volunteer job.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (30:50)', 'Speech': 'To Dorsey & Whitney, that was my dad’s home. He went to the office every day. I once asked him, I said, “What kind of law do you practice? What do you do there?” He says, “Oh, perfume law.” I said, “What’s that?” He goes, “You get the right people in the room and when it smells right, you leave.” So he did that for 20 to 30 years and perfected the art.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (31:19)', 'Speech': 'Tina mentioned it, but Linda Patterson was at his side all the way through and through today. We asked Linda, putting this event together, I said, “Linda, how are you getting the emails out? Are you using MailChimp? Are you using some kind of service?” She goes, “No, I’m sending each one individually.” We’re like, “Oh my goodness. You’ve sent 7,000 emails in the last two weeks.” But thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (31:54)', 'Speech': 'I want to also say one of the things that touched him late in life was the naming … The visionaries that named the St. Croix River Valley after him. It reflected his accomplishments, but the importance of nature, and, of course, his first state with my mom. So thank you for that.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (32:13)', 'Speech': 'To staff, you all have come from all over the country and, indeed, the world to be here with us today, whether it was from the attorney general’s office, the Senate, the White House, the embassy in Japan. He was so proud of the work you did and so proud of the accomplishments that you all achieved together.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (32:36)', 'Speech': 'I just want his oldest staff member. We want to single out Mike Berman, who started with him in 1963. Mike was on every organizing call. And so, we thank Mike for his hard work.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (33:01)', 'Speech': 'There was a story the other day about a former president who they didn’t have records of foreign trips of the gifts. Well, when you go on these foreign trips, they give you a lot of nice gifts. Everyone on the Mondale plane knew that when they landed, Mike Berman would be calling them up and they could keep nothing or he would visit them in their office. So thank you, Mike.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (33:28)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank the campaign staff. I’ve got my hog pin on here. You guys worked so hard for him. It was so great to see you all last night and this morning. Yes, Mr. President, we had eggs and bacon for breakfast.'}, {'Time': 'Ted Mondale: (33:50)', 'Speech': 'Earlier. Jon Meacham reflected on that day in 1948, when it all started for my dad. We know it wasn’t until April 19th, 2021 was when he was forced to stop. And so, William and I, we believe, to honor our father, by doing so is to never stop, to never stop remembering his legacy of profoundly changing America for the better and to never stop doing our part every day to preserve and strengthen our democracy and perfect our union. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (34:32)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Stand over here, Ted. Come here, give me a hug. Dad always took everything that life could throw at him to make the future better for everyone. He only really wanted to look back so we could improve on our common future. As kids, sometimes we were able to get him talking about growing up in what everyone except him would call poverty in southern Minnesota, in Ceylon and in Elmore, no shoes, hitchhiking to college every day, and having one sweater and one pair of pants for all of law school.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (35:35)', 'Speech': 'Dad always considered the devastation of the Great Depression best remembered as a springboard for communal action that brought us the America we all love, the one that our President and our elected leaders and all of us here are fighting to protect and to expand.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (35:59)', 'Speech': 'Mom and dad adored that spirit of the new deal of progressive action for the betterment of everyone, in their home as well as at work. we would listen to music together. One song that just got under dad’s skin was from this beautiful musical called Annie. The movie came out in 1982, and they just loved that musical. dad would sing from that musical with his beautiful, underused baritone voice, and it just never left him. He just loved that song.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (36:49)', 'Speech': 'So why Annie? Well, if we know Annie, the story of the orphan, it’s the tale of how one person who was born without anything Could stay true to her hope and to her optimism to find justice for everyone, everyone in the orphanage and everyone everywhere. And so, that makes sense to me why he really loved that song.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (37:22)', 'Speech': 'We’ve heard about his life, and it’s hard to remember the loss of our family members. It really is. That really slowed dad down. But on his 92nd birthday, and he wasn’t really going out much because he was tired. He was tired.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (37:45)', 'Speech': 'But on that day of his 92nd birthday, my dear child Charlie Mondale, who is here today, he got their best friend to come to sing for dad on his birthday. This person who was Charlie’s first and best friend had become quite a singer and was singing the role of Annie at the Ordway. So we asked Lillian Hochman to come and sing, and what a song, what a joy to hear. Dad was so happy. He was just ready to fly out of the place.'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (38:35)', 'Speech': 'Today, as we ready ourselves to move past this beautiful service, missing those who have gone on before, missing those who could not be here today, President Carter, Secretary Albright, so many others that Ted did such a great job of summarizing and remembering, today as we are ready to move on to our lives of service and action, let’s think for just one more moment about what …'}, {'Time': 'William Mondale: (39:03)', 'Speech': 'Let’s think for just one more moment about what dad would want us to focus on as we leave here. To better our lives and to hone our spirits for community and for joy. To sing one last song, as we move out, I would like Lillian Hochman to come and sing the song Tomorrow from the musical Annie. Let’s all welcome her.'}, {'Time': 'Lillian Hochman: (39:31)', 'Speech': '(singing)'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (42:34)', 'Speech': 'Welcome back to the stage, Governor Tim Walz.'}, {'Time': 'Tim Walz: (42:42)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. I would you ask you, if you’re able, to please rise and join the pride of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota Marching Band, for one more Minnesota rouser for our friend, Fritz.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (42:54)', 'Speech': 'You all know the words.'}]"

I have worked a Lockheed Martin more than 25 years. I have worked on several programs, including Javelin, where I have touched every single one of the 50,000 Javelin missiles that had been built in Troy. 50,000, 50,000. I consider my teammates family, and I can say that the entire Lockheed Martin team is honored by this special guest today. It is a great honor to introduce to you the President of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:17)', 'Speech': 'I tell you what, Linda, if I was CEO of this company I’d be worried.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:25)', 'Speech': 'Well, good afternoon everybody and thank you Jim for the invitation to be here today and Linda for the warm welcome today. And Congressman Sewell, woman Sewell, thank you for all you do for the people of the state and the country and for your friendship, our friendship.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:41)', 'Speech': 'I wanted to come down to Alabama to make sure that the American people know what workers this… And by the way you have seat, please take it. By the way, sometimes the press is always fair with me, but every once in a while, I make a mistake, like once a speech. But anyway, I years ago, when I started talking for this job, I said, “Please take your seats.” There weren’t any seats everyone was standing, there were no chairs. So I just want to make sure I check whether you had seats.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:16)', 'Speech': 'Look, the American people know what worker at this facility you’re doing and support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. And the bottom line is I came to say, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” That’s the reason I’m here. I’ve been in those battlefields where these missiles are fired. And I spent a lot of time going in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan, maybe a total of 40 times. And I tell you what… And I’ve been in Ukraine a lot prior to the war and on the border since the war. And it’s amazing what you’ve done.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:58)', 'Speech': 'We see on the news every single day, the atrocities and the war crimes that are being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, directed by Vladimir Putin. And it really is gut wrenching. We see the incredible bravery of the Ukrainian fighters defending their country with everything they have. And by the way, it’s not just their warriors. It’s not just their military. It’s people on the street. People on the street staying behind. A lot have gotten out, five million, but a lot are staying including women as well as men staying to fight for their country.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:34)', 'Speech': 'And we know that the United States is leading our allies and partners around the world to make sure the courageous Ukrainians who are fighting for the future of their nation, have the weapons and the capacity and ammunition and equipment to defend themselves against Putin’s brutal war. A lot of war crimes being committed. But what we don’t see, we don’t always see, is the work that makes so much of this possible. And that’s you, it’s not hyperbole, it’s you, you make it possible. You make it possible for them to have a shot.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:08)', 'Speech': 'You know, during World War II the United States was known as the arsenal democracy. There was Rosie the Riveter, who I actually got to meet quite frankly before she passed away. And a lot of people who in fact kept it going.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:24)', 'Speech': 'I was a slight digression. I went over for the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and I was in Normandy and I went up afterwards to the cemetery and I was walking by myself and it’s incredible. It’s immaculate, it’s perfectly manicured and the headstones are all the same. I looked down one row and I saw three names, same names, father and two sons who had died in the landing, and I was bent down and I was reading the dates of their births. And all of a sudden I heard behind me, “Attention.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:12)', 'Speech': 'And I turned around and there was a gentleman who had to be in his early 80s, in a wheelchair, being wheeled by his son who was a big guy looked like Hoss Cartwright and his wife and one other, a daughter and he saluted me. So I saluted him. And at the time, and I turned, I said, “Thank you for what you did. Thank you for saving, literally saving, civilization.” And he put his hand on his wife, who’s hand was on his shoulder. And he said, “No, no, she did it. She did it.” I looked at her and said, “She built the landing craft that got us in here. She and her friends, they’re the ones that did it.” And he went on and he filled up and all of a sudden the dawned on me, “You’re doing it. You really are doing it. You’re making a gigantic difference for these poor sons of guns who are under such enormous, enormous pressure and firepower.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:16)', 'Speech': 'Those Javelins I saw, there’s 10 for every tank that there is in Ukraine right now. You’re changing people’s lives. We built the weapons… No you really do. But we built the weapons and the equipment that helped defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe, years ago. But that’s true again today.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:42)', 'Speech': 'You know some of the best, most effective weapons in our arsenal, those Javelin missiles, like the ones manufactured right here in Pike County, they’re highly portable. They’re extremely effective against a wide range of armored targets. They can hit targets up to 400 meters away and have a fire and forget capability. That means the person firing can… I know, you know it, but it’s for anybody who maybe listening, can change positions or take cover before that Javelin even strikes home, hits the target.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:12)', 'Speech': 'In fact, they’ve been so important. There’s even a story about Ukrainian parents naming their children, not a joke, their newborn child Javelin, or Javelina, not a joke. So the brave people in Ukraine, including the many civilians who have taken up arms to defend their country, deserve every ounce of credit for pushing back the Russian assault and frustrating Putin’s desire to dominate Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:41)', 'Speech': 'We’re at an inflection point in history, for real, it comes along about every six or eight generations where things are changing so rapidly that we have to be in control. Folks, there’s an ongoing battle in the world between autocracy and democracy.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:01)', 'Speech': 'Xi Jinping, the leader of China, who I’ve talked with, spent more time with than any other world leader has, over 78 hours either in person or on the telephone with him. And the fact of the matter is he just is straightforward about it. He says, “That democracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century.” Not a joke. “They cannot be sustained because things are moving so rapidly, democracies require consensus, and it’s hard to get consensus therefore they can’t keep up with an autocracy, one man rule.” But that’s not going to be the case, if that happens the whole world changes.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:39)', 'Speech': 'I mean, because of you in this first really battle, if you will, for that, to determine whether that’s going to happen is because you’re making it possible. You’re making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves without us having to risk getting in a third world war by sending an American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:02)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to have an expression. He said, “The only war worse than one that’s intended is one that’s unintended.” You’re allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves. And quite frankly, they’re making fools of the Russian military in many instances. A big part of the reason they’ve been able to keep up fighting and to make this war a strategic failure for Russia is because the United States together with our allies and partners have had their back. The United States alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelins to Ukraine. You’re changing the nation. You really are. Add to that significant supplies from our allies and partners, as well as many thousands of other anti-tank and anti-air weapons, helicopters, armored vehicles, artillery, coastal defense systems.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:49)', 'Speech': 'Before Russia attacked, we made sure Russia had Javelins and other weapons, the strength of the defenses of Ukraine was ready for whatever happened. In the last two months, we continue to move even more resources than equipment at a rapid pace in the Ukraine. We’ve made sure that there are no interruptions in the flow of equipment to Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:09)', 'Speech': 'Since Russia invaded Ukraine just over two months ago, we have sent more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, alone, us, not to counting our allies. And that money is a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself. Because if you don’t stand up to dictators, history has shown us they keep coming. They keep coming. Their appetite for power continues to grow. And every worker in this facility and every American taxpayer is directly contributing to the case for freedom. And that’s something we can all be incredibly proud of, in my view.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:47)', 'Speech': 'Last week, I sent Congress… If you excuse the point of personal privilege talking like an old Senator, but I sent a supplemental budget, a fancy way of saying, “We need more money.” To make sure the United States can continue to send weapons directly to the front lines of freedom and Ukraine, and to continue to provide economic and humanitarian assistance to help the Ukrainian people. And I urge the Congress to pass this funding quickly, to help Ukraine continue to succeed against Russian aggression just as they did when they won the battle of Kiev. And to make sure the United States and our allies can replenish our own stocks of weapons to replace what we’ve sent to Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:25)', 'Speech': 'As I said from the beginning, “This fight is not going to be cheap, but caving to aggression would even be more costly.” We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country, or we stand by as Russia continues its atrocities and aggression. I know what the answer is and I think you all do too. I bet I know what the answer to this plan is.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:48)', 'Speech': 'There’s something else here to be understood. Being the arsenal of democracy also means good paying jobs for American workers. In Alabama and the states all across America where defense equipment is manufactured and assembled 265 people here at this plant are directly employed working on the Javelin program. All told Lockheed Martin has brought nearly 3,000 jobs to Alabama.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:15)', 'Speech': 'The Armed Forces of the United States of America are going to continue to be the best armed, most capable fighting force in the history of the world. In order to do that, we have to make sure our vital defense supplies are getting the inputs and supplies they need to produce and protect and provide the full capacity.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:32)', 'Speech': 'I learned on the tour today that each of the Javelins you produce includes more than 200 semiconductors. I’ve been a broken record, as the press will tell you, on our need to be able to produce more semiconductors in the United States. We invented the sucker, going to the moon, we, the United States, we’re the one that modernized it. We’ve done more than anybody else, but guess what? We stopped investing in ourselves. We stopped investing in ourselves.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:59)', 'Speech': 'And so now we’re what back in the game, making sure that we become, we become, the primary producer of those semiconductors. Computer chips that power much of our modern lives in our phones, our cars, almost anything that has an on-off switch. And the semiconductor is critical to defense production capacity as you all know better than I do. That’s why we’re making it as hard as we can for Russia to get hold of these semiconductors and advanced technologies that it could use to upgrade its military during this conflict. And why we’re taking steps to make it easier to source what we need here in the United States, during a global semiconductor shortage.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:40)', 'Speech': 'And there’s just one more reason why Congress has that quickly to provide the emergency funding of a so-called Chips Act by passing a broader bipartisan Innovation Act so we can produce tens of millions of these chips. There’s something we have to focus on and something I focused on from my early stages of our administration. I’m determined to make sure the United States hold its technological high ground in competition with other nations, especially China, as we move forward.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:09)', 'Speech': 'Folks, you know we used to invest as a nation years ago, 35 years ago, we invested 2% of our entire GDP in research and development. We do half of that now. We do half of that. We used to be number one in the world. Now we’re number 13 in the world. My administration we’re changing that. The United States used to own the innovation field. In fact, it was the Department of Research program that established DARPA for the first development of an anti-tank missile with advanced infrared guidance systems that culminate in today’s Javelin.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:47)', 'Speech': 'The bipartisan Innovation Act is going to help reverse decades long decline in federal research and development investment. And it should create and support entire families and expand US manufacturing and strengthen our national security. Where in God’s name is written that the United States can no longer be a leading manufacturer in the world?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:07)', 'Speech': 'We’ve created just in the last 17 months 465,000 permanent manufacturing jobs in America. We have the best workers, the most competent employees, the best science in the world. And by funding the Chips Act, we’re going to ensure that semiconductors that power of the economy and our national security are made here in America again.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:31)', 'Speech': 'Today, all of the world’s most advanced chips are made overseas, but the events of the past few years have proven beyond a doubt that America’s security should never be held hostage to events overseas. Not a pandemic, not a war, not the politics of ambition or other countries. Fundamentally this a national security issue.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:53)', 'Speech': 'This is one of the reasons why the Chinese communist party is lobbying folks to oppose this bill and it’s an issue that unites Democrats and Republicans. So let’s get it done. Let’s get it done.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:08)', 'Speech': 'In her introduction, Linda said she personally touched every single solitary Javelin, 50,000 that have been manufactured in this plant 20 years ago. I was worried to shake your hand. I thought you might be electrocuted, but that’s where they start right here with American skill, American craftsmanship, American patriotism.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:36)', 'Speech': 'And just a few days ago, The Wall Street Journal quoted a young Hungarian fighter saying, and I quote, “Without the Javelins, it would’ve been very hard to stop the enemy pushing ahead.” End of quote. So these weapons touched by the hands, your hands, are in the hands of Ukrainian heroes making a significant difference. That’s something each and every day you could and should be proud of. And I’m once more urging Congress to quickly pass this supplemental funding bill, over $300 billion to help the Ukrainians so they can keep all of you, very, very busy for a while here.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:15)', 'Speech': 'So again, let me end where I began. I came for a basic reason, from the bottom of my heart to say, “Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you do. Thank you for what you continue to do. Unless you go out in the field and see it, you don’t realize what a difference you’re making.” May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.'}]"

You got it?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:37)', 'Speech': 'Well, good afternoon. Before I begin, let me tell you, I’ll be around to answer questions on a lot of things. But, I got 600 Olympians waiting out there for me. If you keep me too long, they’ll rush the place. And all kidding aside, this week, my administration released new information that contains that we’re on track to cut the federal deficit by another, another $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. The biggest decline in a single year ever in American history. The biggest decline on top of us having a $350 billion drop in the deficit last year, my first year as President. We also learned that for the first time since 2016, the Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt issued to the public this quarter. And for all the talk the Republicans make about deficits, it didn’t happen a single quarter under my predecessor, not once.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:35)', 'Speech': 'The bottom line is the deficit went up every year under my predecessor before the pandemic and during the pandemic. And it’s gone down both years since I’ve been here, period. They’re the facts. And why is it important? Because bringing down the deficit is one way to ease inflationary pressures in an economy where a consequence of a war and gas prices and oil and all food and it all, it’s a different world, right at this moment because of Ukraine and Russia.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:04)', 'Speech': 'We reduced federal borrowing and we help combat inflation. This process is a great deal, is good news, but it didn’t happen by itself. The previous administration increased the deficit every year it was an office, in part because of its reckless two trillion dollar tax cut. I know you’re tired of hearing me say that. But, a two trillion dollar tax cut that was not paid for. Was not paid for and a tax cut that largely benefited the biggest corporations, 55 of which earned 40 billion in profits and paid not a single pending income tax in 2020 and wealthiest Americans like the billionaires who on average pay just 8% in federal taxes. The previous administration, not only ballooned the deficit, it undermined the watchdogs, the inspector generals, whose job it was to keep the pandemic relief funds from being wasted.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:59)', 'Speech': 'Remember, at the time I kept saying, “They’re going to fire this, the inspector generals.” Well, they fired the inspector general and in my administration, those watch dogs are back. The Justice Department has a Chief Prosecutor for Pandemic Fraud who’s going to go after the criminals who stole billions, billions of relief money meant for small businesses and American families, but never got to them. It got in the pockets of criminals.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:24)', 'Speech': 'When I came to office, we took a different approach across the board. With the American Rescue Plan and other actions, we started to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Rescue checks and tax cuts for working families that gave them just a little bit of breathing room and put food on the table and a roof over their heads. Remember the first year, all those long lines of automobiles lined up and going through a parking lot, just to get a box of food in their trunk? All those, all that, we got vaccination shots in arms that helped us go from two million Americans who’d been vaccinated to more than 220 million Americans fully vaccinated.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:02)', 'Speech': 'And we made it easy for millions of Americans to sign up for coverage on the Affordable Care Act, saving them an average of $2,400 a year. As a result of these in other economic recovery plans, we recovered faster than projected, a record 6.7 million jobs created last year, the most in the first year of any President in American history and the fastest economic growth in any year in nearly four decades. And looking ahead, I have a plan to reduce the deficit even more, which will help reduce inflationary pressures and lower everyone’s costs for families.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:38)', 'Speech': 'Look, it’s a plan that lets Medicare negotiate price of prescription drugs. As they do with the Department of Veterans Affairs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 instead of the hundreds of dollars, even a thousand dollars a month for some families.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:54)', 'Speech': 'And my plan provides tax credits to utility companies to generate clean energy. And those companies are required to pass those savings on to families. I met with about a dozen of those utility CEOs here in the White House. And they confirm this plan will lower energy bills for families immediately. My plan includes tax credits for consumers to purchase electric or fuel cell vehicles, new or used, which will say the typical driver about $80 a month, not having to pay for gas at the pump. Tax credits for folks to buy solar panels and heat pumps and more efficient windows and doors for their homes, estimated savings $500 per year on average. And we can do these things by making sure that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single penny more in federal taxes. All we’re asking is that the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations begin to pay their fair share, at least part of their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:54)', 'Speech': 'You’ve heard me say it before. I’m a capitalist. I believe you should be able to make much money as you legally can. But just pay your fair share. There’s no reason why a billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter. That’s in sharp contrast to what today’s Republican party is offering. And if they hadn’t put this in print, you’d think I was making it up.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:19)', 'Speech': 'Senator Rick Scott of Florida, United States, Senator who’s leading the Republican National Senatorial Campaign Committee released what he calls the ultra MAGA agenda. It’s a MAGA agenda all right. Let me tell you about this ultra MAGA agenda. It’s extreme as most MAGA things are. It will actually raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95% of whom make less than a hundred thousand dollars a year. Among the hardest hit? Working families, kids with folks.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:52)', 'Speech': 'Imagine you’re a family of four and you don’t pay-, you don’t make enough money to have federal taxes because you don’t make enough money to pay them. You pay all your taxes, but you just don’t make enough. And under this new plan, this tax plan, the ultra MAGA agenda, while big corporations and billionaires are going to pay nothing more. The working class folk are going to pay a hell lot more. And it goes further than that. This extreme Republican agenda calls for Congress. Now this is, I’m not making this up either. You ought really think about this. It requires a vote, if it were to pass, every five years, the Congress would have to vote to reinstate or eliminate social security, Medicare and Medicaid. Social security is something seniors have paid in for their whole life. And it has to be reauthorized? Has to be reauthorized every five years?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:54)', 'Speech': 'Look, again, it’s hard to make this up, but then again, it’s a MAGA agenda. You know, meanwhile, millionaires and billionaires and corporations skate by. Imagine that. Just imagine that. I think it is truly outrageous. I’ve offered a different plan, a plan rooted in American values of fairness and decency. Wealthy folks and corporations will pay a little more. Billionaires will have to pay a minimum tax. And again, most importantly, no one making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in federal taxes. We’re going to protect the strength in social security and Medicare, not put it on the block every five years. Let me remind you again. I reduced the federal deficit, all the talk about the deficit from my Republican friends. I love it. I’ve reduced it 350 billion dollars in my first year in office. And we’re on track to reduce it by the end of September, by another one, trillion 500 billion, the largest drop ever.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:55)', 'Speech': 'I don’t want to hear Republicans talk about deficits and their ultra MAGA agenda. I want to hear about fairness. I want to hear about decency. I want to hear about helping ordinary people. The bottom line is that for decades, the trickle down economics has failed as income inequity grew to historic levels under the Republicans. The mega Republicans, the MAGA Republicans, excuse me, because I don’t want to mispronounce it. The MAGA Republicans.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:21)', 'Speech': 'This is time to grow the economy, but from the bottom up in the middle out, because here’s the deal. When the poor have a ladder up and the middle class grows, the wealthy always do very well. They do very well. That’s what this is about. That’s what this is about, everybody doing better. And so I want you to understand again, first year, 350 billion reduction in deficit. This year, a trillion five. It’s going to bring some relief. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:51)', 'Speech': 'I’ll take a few questions quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (09:54)', 'Speech': 'Can ask you a question about sanctions?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:55)', 'Speech': 'About what?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (09:55)', 'Speech': 'About the EU … About sanctions against or about further sanctions in Europe. The European Union today announced new sanctions against oil against Russia. What’s the next round for the US and also on a separate issue, what’s the next step on abortion, once this case gets settled?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:12)', 'Speech': 'You don’t want to ask about deficits, huh? We want to make sure this doesn’t get covered. Okay, here we go. I’m going to answer those two questions, then I’m going to go out to talk to the Olympians.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:22)', 'Speech': 'With regard to the additional sanctions. We’re always open to additional sanctions and I’ve been in consultation. I’ll be speaking with the members of the G7 this week about what we’re going to do or not do, number one.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:36)', 'Speech': 'Number two, what was the second one you wanted? Oh look …'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (10:40)', 'Speech': 'The second one was on abortion.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:42)', 'Speech': 'As I said, when I, when this hit as I was getting on the plane to go down to Alabama. This is about a lot more than abortion. I hadn’t read the whole opinion at that time. But this reminds me of the debate with Robert Bork. Bork believed the only reason you had any inherent rights was because the government gave them to you. If you go back and look at the opening comments, of Bork-Biden, when I was questioning him as chairman, I said, “I believe I have the rights that I have not because the government gave them to me, which you believe, but because I’m just a child of God, I exist. I delegate it by joining this union here to delegate some obligat-, some rights I have to the governments for social good.” So the idea that somehow there is a inherent right, that there is no right of privacy, that there is no right.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:41)', 'Speech': 'And remember the debate we, you don’t remember, but we had a debate about Griswold versus Connecticut. There had been a law, saying a married couple could not purchase birth control and the privacy of their own bedroom and use it. Well that got struck down. Griswold was thought to be a bad decision by Bork and my guess is the guys on the Supreme Court now.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:03)', 'Speech': 'What happens if you have state changes the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can’t be in classrooms with other children? Is that legit under the way the decisions written? What are the next things that are going to be attacked? Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history.'}, {'Time': 'Reporter pool: (12:35)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:12:35]'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (12:35)', 'Speech': 'Like you did on voting rights. Mr. President?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 5: (12:37)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, how can you combat it?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 8: (12:48)', 'Speech': 'Okay, guys, give us [inaudible 00:12:48].'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (12:48)', 'Speech': 'Let’s go. Let’s move. I’ll walk you guys directly to the South Lawn.'}, {'Time': 'Reporter pool: (12:49)', 'Speech': 'See you. Thanks.'}, {'Time': 'Reporter pool: (12:49)', 'Speech': 'We’ll come back here and [inaudible 00:12:54].'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 8: (12:54)', 'Speech': 'If you want to take it now, you’re more than welcome to take it now.

Wade 5/03/22 Transcript,"[{'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (00:00)', 'Speech': 'If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, the whole range of rights are in question, a whole range of rights. And the idea we’re letting the states make those decisions, localities make those decisions would be a fundamental shift in what we’ve done. So it goes far beyond, in my view, if it becomes a law and if what is written is what remains, it goes far beyond the concern of whether or not there is the right to choose. It goes to other basic rights, the right to marry, the right to determine the whole range of things. Because one of the issues that this Court, many of the members of the Court, a number of the members of the Court have not acknowledged is that there is a right to privacy in our Constitution.'}]"

So hello, Olympians and Paralympians. Welcome to the White House, Doug and I were so grateful to see your games in Japan, and Tokyo was the first time I had the opportunity to see a three on three women’s basketball game. And I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was everything I love about sports. Oh, you guys can sit down. Oh, I’ll start again. It was everything I love about sports. The moment when the team shows it seems to each other’s thoughts, the air is electric with that connection. When the crowd is breathing with one breath, our heart’s racing to the rhythm of each thump of the ball, every basket, pure joy. As I watched Stefanie, Allisha, Kelsey, and Jackie fly back and forth on that court, only one thing mattered to the crowd. We were all team USA.'}, {'Time': 'Jill Biden: (03:39)', 'Speech': 'That’s the power of what all of you do. You don’t just play a game, run a race, hit a target, or win a competition. With every step, jump, roll, kick, and twirl, you show us the heights of our human potential. You show us how to fail and then get back up. You teach us that hard work and sacrifice and determination can push us beyond what we ever thought was in our reach. When we cheer you on, we are more than our cities or our states or our backgrounds. We are a part of something bigger than ourselves.'}, {'Time': 'Jill Biden: (04:26)', 'Speech': 'You help us believe in the impossible, and leave our differences behind. Now, I know that these games may not have been exactly as you once imagined, with stadiums, packed with people and all of your loved ones, screaming from the sidelines, but you are all champions, just the same. Becoming an Olympian or a Paralympian is a rare accomplishment in a normal time, but you did it during a global pandemic.

You know, as the guy heads up the Veterans Affairs for America, the big guy standing, please sit down guys, knows, I’m glad the Lord didn’t come down and give me a choice between being president and Olympian. I had all those Walter Mitty dreams and they weren’t about being president and being about a great athlete. Thought I was in high school and college, but I’d tell you what you all are incredible. Absolutely incredible. Welcome to the White House. Welcome to the White House. This is your house. This is the people’s house. The Bidens are a big sports fan. We love watching the Olympics.

Between the time it was set and time to go. I mean, you’ve been through so darn much. Been through so much. 600 American Olympians and Paralympians from the summer games in Tokyo and the Winter Games in Beijing, athletes from all across America, from all kinds of backgrounds, including 18 veterans of the United States Armed Forces who are here today. And more than 260 medals across a dozen sports weighing a million pounds.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:05)', 'Speech': 'Thanks for letting me hold those medals, man. Made me feel important for a second. They are something else. Thank you. We also know the pride your families felt, and how hard it was for them and for you that they couldn’t be there in person with you. Our favorite part of Olympics, Jill and my family was watching your families watch you. I’m not joking. Watching your families watch you. Learning about who you are. Because we learn about how big and diverse and talent and how great this nation is. Just how diverse we are. The pandemic made training and competing especially difficult and draining, but you did it. You all did it. We were in awe, not just of your incredible athleticism, but your endurance and your state of mind. But most of all, your character. You all have such incredible character. No matter what event you compete in, you draw inspiration from your work, your hard work, your courage, your discipline.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:05)', 'Speech': 'As you watch it, as we watch you, I’m serious. Whether you’re a would be athlete like me, or you’re never played a sport, I’m serious. Look at you. Look how you handle victory and defeat. It’s just astounding, astounding. And as I was saying to a couple of the Paralympians, you inspire people. You inspire people around the world. You inspire them to pursue their hopes and their dreams. Not just in sport, but in life. I’ve had kids come up to me and say, did you see, did you see? I think I can. Not a joke. You all know it. It’s real. The people you’ll never meet. Witness how hard you competed, trained and pushed yourself. And you help them believe in themselves. You’ve helped them believe that they can do things that, “Maybe, maybe just, maybe I can.” They look at you and see that despite the emotional, mental, and financial and physical toll, you’ve never given up, you just don’t quit. As I said to our foreign leaders, my counterparts, there’s no quit in America. There’s just no quit. And you’re the quintessential example of that. There’s no quit in America. None.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:28)', 'Speech': 'The power of your example gives so many people strength to never give up as well. It matters, particularly matters today because of the pandemic. So much turmoil has occurred. So many people are dealing with problems, particularly little kids in terms of health, mental health problems, and the like. You’ve given people so much hope. In you, I see who we are as a nation. The only nation in the world that can be defined by one word. One word. I was asked when I was in the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping, and he looked at me. I had a simultaneous interpreter, and he had one. And he looked at me and said, “Can you define America for me?” It’s a true story. It’s been published all over the world by now. And I said, “Yes, I can. In one word. Possibilities.” We believe, in America, anything is possible. And you are the explanation of what we mean. It’s all about possibility'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:33)', 'Speech': 'Breaking limits. You represent the very soul of America and that’s not hyperbole. You genuinely do. I’m sure you’ve been told this a thousand times since you’ve been home, when people talk to you and tell you about what they thought when they were watching you know. And as sports does, like few things, you helped us unite the nation. We’ve been a very divided nation, philosophically, of late, but you brought us together. For no matter to divisions, when we see you compete, we feel a common pride in those three letters. USA. I mean that. There’s a common pride that crosses all political spectrums. Through the lows and the highs and the tears and the joy, we were with you every moment. All of you.

This will not be my only speech on inflation I’m sure, but we look at the economy today, it’s clear we’ve made enormous strides and our plans and our policies have produced the strongest job creation economy in modern times. In addition, 8.3 million jobs in my first 15 months in office. Record unemployment rates were down to 3.6%, the fastest decline in unemployment to start a presidential term ever recorded.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:40)', 'Speech': 'And in addition, Americans have applied to start 5.4 million new small businesses last year, 20% more than any other year on record. And as I see it, everything across the country is… As I go across the country, our economy has gone from being on the mend to on the move. But for every worker I met who’s gained a little bit of breathing room to seek out a better paying job, for every entrepreneur who’s gained the confidence to pursue their small business dreams, I know that families all across America are hurting because of inflation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:22)', 'Speech': 'I understand what it feels like. I come from a family where, when the price of gas or food went up, we felt it. It was a discussion at the kitchen table. I want every American to know that I’m taking inflation very seriously and it’s my top domestic priority. And I’m here today to talk about solutions and there’s going to be more we’re going to have to talk about as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:46)', 'Speech': 'But first, I want us to be crystal clear about the problem. There are two leading causes of inflation we’re seeing today. The first cause of inflation is a once-in-a-century pandemic. Not only did it shut down our global economy, but threw the supply change and demand completely out of whack, especially in countries where more effective recovery responses weren’t available. Especially in those sectors that rely on semiconductors. These supply challenges have been further hampered by the onset of Delta and Omicron viruses. And you’ve all seen it. You’ve all felt it. And this year we have a second cause. Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine, we saw in March that 60% of inflation that month was due to price increases at the pump for gasoline. Putin’s war has raised food prices as well because Ukraine and Russia, two of the world’s major bread baskets for wheat and corn are essentially completely stalled. Ukraine has 20 million tons of grain in storage and silos right now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:04)', 'Speech': 'We’re trying to figure out how to get out of the country to market, which would reduce prices around the world. Normally we’d have already begun to export them into the market, but it hasn’t because of Putin’s invasion. So we’re working with our European partners to get this food out into the world so they could help bring down prices. But it’s difficult because, again, of Putin and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And those two major contributors to inflation are both global in nature. That’s why we’re seeing historic inflation in countries all over the world, but here’s the good news. Because of the actions we’ve taken, America’s in the stronger position to meet this challenge than just about any other country in the world. Some of the roots of the inflation are outside of our control, to state the obvious. But there are things we can do and we can address, and we need to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:57)', 'Speech': 'That starts with the Federal Reserve, which plays a primary role in budget inflation in our country. I put forward highly qualified nominees to lead that institution. And I strongly urge the Senate to confirm them without delay. The Fed has dual responsibilities. First is achieving maximum employment, and second is stable prices. And while I’ll never interfere with the Fed’s judgments and decisions or tell them what they have to do, they’re independent, they’re independent. I believe that inflation is our top economic challenge right now. And I think they do, too. We’ve built a strong economy with a strong job market. And I agree with what Chairman Powell said last week, that the number one threat is the strength and that strength that we built is inflation. So the Fed should do its job and it will do its job, I’m convinced, with that in mind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:54)', 'Speech': 'Now, as I said, when I came to what Congress and the President can do to fight inflation, Americans have two potential to paths forward. The first is my plan. The democratic plan put forward by congressional Republicans is a second alternative. Here’s how each of us would tackle inflation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:15)', 'Speech': 'My plan is to lower everyday costs for hard working Americans and lower the deficit by asking large corporations and the wealthiest Americans to not engage in price gouging and to pay their fair share in taxes. Republican plan is to increase taxes on the middle class families, let billionaires and large companies off the hook as they raise prices and reap profits at record amounts. And it’s really that simple. But let me explain why this choice is so important.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:51)', 'Speech': 'Let me start with the Putin price hike, high gas prices and energy prices. My plan is already in motion. I led the world and other countries to be joined with us, to coordinate the largest release of oil from our stockpiles of all the countries in history, 240 million barrels to boost global supply. Here at home, US oil and gas production is approaching record levels. In fact, we produced more oil domestically in my first year in office than my predecessor did in his first year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:28)', 'Speech': 'To further drive down prices, my administration is allowing the sale of gasoline using homegrown biofuels this summer, which wasn’t allowed before. And to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and reckless autocrats like Putin, I’m working with Congress to pass landmark investments, to help build a clean energy future as well. From tax credits for businesses to produce renewable energy, to tax credits for families to make their homes more energy efficient.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:59)', 'Speech': 'I met with nearly a dozen CEOs of America’s largest utility companies and they, to a person, told me that. And then including Southern Company, American Electric Power and 10 others, they confirmed that if we pass the investments I’m talking about, will immediately lower family’s utility bills by as much as $500 a year, according to one estimate, that’s by they’re going to make their homes more secure in terms of heat not getting out and air conditioning not escaping because they have good insulation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:31)', 'Speech': 'Now what’s the congressional Republican plan with respect to energy? First of all, their plan is to give oil companies a free pass. For example, right now oil companies are sitting on 9,000 unused oil leases, which are on the property of the federal government. Under my plan, they would have to pay taxes and if they don’t use those leases to produce more oil, just can’t sit on it. Unlike under the Republican plan, they’d be allowed to continue to sit on the-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:03)', 'Speech': '… under the Republican plan, they’d be allowed to continue to sit on this land without producing, while shipping record profits back to their investors. The fact is, the average cost of a barrel of oil has been steady for weeks, so why do gas prices keep going up so high? Republicans have offered plenty of blame, but not a single solution to actually bring down the energy prices. We have no plan… They have no plan to bring down energy prices today, no plan to get us to a cleaner energy independent future tomorrow so in the future American families are no longer subject to the whims of dictators half away around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:44)', 'Speech': 'The next thing is, let’s compare our plans when it comes to the lowering everyday costs. My plan is to make concrete, concrete, common sense steps to bring down the biggest expenses that families are facing. Let’s take drug prices, my plan will let Medicare negotiate prices for prescription drugs like they do with the military, as it relates to what the administration is able to negotiate for prices for military. And I also call for a cap on the price of insulin, which 200,000 American children rely on because they have type 2 diabetes, at $35 a month. It cost 10 bucks to make the insulin, they make a significant profit, instead of the average price of about $640 a month. Think of the difference it will make in millions of American families, like the family I met with in Virginia about three weeks ago struggling every day, every single month, to afford their son’s insulin. On this and other issues, I’ve laid out specific proposals to Congress to bring down the cost of everyday costs that many American families face. And that’s in addition to the work my administration has already done the lower prices.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:11)', 'Speech': 'Another reason why prices are up for products people need relates to whether or not the manufacturer has access to all the materials they need to build a product. Think of the materials you need to build a house, if you can’t get the materials from the ship to shore, from the shore to the home, the prices are going to go up. That’s why we brought labor and industry together on the West Coast to improve operations at the ports, to speed up the transfer of products from abroad to shore, from shore to the location where they’re going to be used, so those products can move more quickly and cheaply. We haven’t had enough truckers, for example, to deliver the lumber or other goods, that’s why we are executing a plan to get more truckers on the job. It reduces the time it takes to move the goods quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:07)', 'Speech': 'Another problem we face is in some industries, it’s just there isn’t enough competition. And I’ve often said that capitalism without competition, isn’t capitalism, it’s exploitation. So we’re promoting competition for everything from internet services to meat processing. We basically have four meat processors in the whole country, they process the meat that goes into the hamburgers you buy. So they set the price. When there’s no competition, they can set the price higher and higher. So we’re helping smaller companies get into the game to compete and help bring down the overall prices. The bottom line is easing, easing these bottlenecks and making our supply chains more secure is a major focus of my economic strategy, so things move more quickly. Prices go down, not up. Some parts of my plan I’ve been able to get done on my own.I mean, just without congressional approval, some parts are being held up by Congress, but all of my plan is focused on lowering costs for the average family of America, to give them just a little bit of breathing room.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:18)', 'Speech': 'And what’s the Congressional Republican plan? They don’t want to solve inflation by lowering your costs, they want to solve it by raising your taxes and lowering your income. I happen to think it’s a good thing when American families have a little more money in their pockets at the end of the month, but Republicans in Congress don’t seem to think so, their plan is actually going to make working families poor. You don’t have to take my word for it, it’s in writing. They’ve made their intentions perfectly clear. Senator Rick Scott, Wisconsin, a member of the Senate Republic leadership laid it all out in a plan, it’s the Ultra-MAGA Agenda. Their plan is to raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95% of who make less than a hundred thousand dollars a year total income, the average tax increase going to be about $1,500 per family.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:15)', 'Speech': 'They’ve got it backwards in my view. I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires. In recent years, the average billionaire has paid about 8% in federal taxes. Congressional Republicans have proposed increasing taxes on teachers and firefighters. 55% of the largest corporations paid net zero in federal taxes in 2020 on $40 million profits. It just isn’t right. That’s why I proposed a minimum tax for corporations. Their plan would also raise taxes on 82% of small business owners making less than $50,000 a year, but it’ll do nothing to hold big corporations and companies accountable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:01)', 'Speech': 'Think about it, republicans in Congress are so deeply committed to protecting big corporations and CEOs that they would rather see taxes on working American families and try to depress their wages to take on inflation, nevermind the fact that many of these companies are recording record profit margins even as prices as they raise prices record amounts. Look, you’ve heard me say before, I’m a capitalist. I’m not out to punish anybody. I have no problem with companies getting and generating reasonable profits. But in this moment of peril with the war overseas and inflation surging around the world, the last thing we should be thinking about is rewarding companies for exploiting the situation. While families struggle to pay their bills, some corporate executives are on earnings calls with investors on Wall Street cheering their record profits, and explain how they’re using this period of inflation to cover the rise in prices far beyond what they need to do to cover their cost. And all this time they’re not even paying for a fair share of taxes in the first place.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:17)', 'Speech': 'You want to bring down inflation, let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share. My plan, asks those companies to pay their fair share in taxes. The Congressional Republican plan, let them off scot free. And if you weren’t extreme enough from the Congressional Republican agenda, they put it in writing. It also calls on Congress to put Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years. Now, if I hadn’t seen in writing, I’d think somebody’s making this up. Their proposal is every five years all those programs would cease unless they’re revoted, that the Congress…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': '… would cease unless they’re re-voted, that the Congress comes along and says, “Yeah, we want to keep these plans,” affirmatively voting for them. Well, imagine the change that’s going to take place then, man. Imagine all the bargaining that’s going to take place. If Democrats want to maintain Social Security, you got to give up such and such. Look, I want to give Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices and make it stronger and lowers your cost. Republicans in Congress want to make Medicare’s very existence up for a vote over and over again, along Social Security and Medicaid. Really ask yourself, how well are we going to sleep at night knowing that every five years MAGA Republicans, if they’re still Republican? As I said, this is not your father’s Republican Party.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:52)', 'Speech': 'If we’re going to have to vote on whether you will have Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and what amounts you’ll have in each of those programs, you know what they’re likely to do, use them as hostages every five years to get their way in other things. Think about it. Give us another tax cut for billionaires or Social Security gets it. Stop investing in clean energy or you’re going to kiss your Medicare goodbye. It’s outrageous. It’s outrageous. I can’t believe that the majority of Republicans buy on to Scott’s plan, but that’s a plan in writing and he’s in the leadership. Finally, let’s do one more comparison. Let’s compare our two plans when it comes to the deficit. Republicans love to attack me as a big spender as if that’s a reason why inflation’s gone up. Let’s compare the facts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:49)', 'Speech': 'Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year under the Republicans. Under my plan, we’re on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion this year. Let me say it again, $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year, the biggest one year decline in all of history and for America. That’s in addition to last year we cut the deficit $350 billion. My Treasury Department is planning to pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor, not once. Because unlike my predecessor, the deficit has gone down both years I’ve been here. That is not an abstraction. It matters. It matters to families because reducing the deficit is one of the main ways we can ease inflationary pressures. Look, the bottom line is this, Americans have a choice right now between two paths reflecting two very different sets of values. My plan attacks inflation and grows the economy by lowering cost for working families, giving workers well deserved raises, reducing the deficit by historic levels, and making big corporations and the very wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. The other path is the ultra-MAGA plan put forward by Congressional Republicans to raise taxes on working families, lower the income of American workers, threaten sacred programs Americans count on like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and give break after break to big corporations and billionaires just like they did the last time they were in power when their top priority was the reckless $2 trillion tax cut, the majority of them going to the very wealthiest Americans, which ballooned the deficit and not a penny of it was paid for.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:12)', 'Speech': 'Look, I know you’ve got to be frustrated. I know, I can taste it, frustrated by high prices, by gridlock in Congress, by the time it takes to get anything done. Believe me, I understand the frustration, but the fact is Congressional Republicans, not all of them, but the MAGA Republicans, are counting on you to be as frustrated by the pace of progress, which they’ve done everything they can to slow down, that you will hand power over to them so they can enact their extreme agenda. Look at their agenda. We’ll put it up on a webpage somewhere, I think I can do this, the Scott Plan, it’s in writing. We need a government focused on what families actually need so I urge all Americans to think about the path I’ve laid forward. We’re going to have to do more beyond what I laid forward, but then think about what the Republicans in Congress are actually proposing. Which path is right for you and for your family and, quite frankly, for America? Let’s build on the extraordinary process and progress we’ve made instead of tearing it down. Let’s focus on what matters. This really matters to average Americans. I want to thank you all God, bless you, and may God protect our troops.

And do you believe that you and your administration bear some measure of responsibility for the inflation that we’re seeing across the country?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:09)', 'Speech': 'First is we’re in power, that’s the first thing. And you’re justifiably right, we control all three branches of the government. Well, we don’t really. We have 50/50 in the Senate. You need 60 votes to get major things done. I’ve been pushing the things I’ve been proposing here and you’ve heard me speak to today since I got in office. I need to get 60 votes to be able to even pass them, number one. Number two, I think they’re not focused. All they’re focused on understandably is the problem they’re facing. They get a five and a half percent raise, an average raise in their salaries, and yet inflation exceeds that and they look around the world and they know that a lot of it’s extremely complicated. And so they’re frustrated and I don’t blame them. I really don’t blame them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:06)', 'Speech': 'There’s a lot we have to do, but you know as well, I shouldn’t say you, I think what I have to do is explain in simple, straightforward language what’s going on. The reason why 30% of the inflation last year is because automobiles cost more. Why do they cost more? They couldn’t get the computer chips to make them. People are making a lot more money. They wanted to buy the automobiles. They couldn’t buy them because the costs went up so high because there were so few of them. The same way this year the reason why prices are up. They understand, but they don’t. Look, most people, the vast majority Americans are hoping that their government just takes care of their problem and they don’t have to think about it in detail at the kitchen table or at the dinner table. And that’s understandable no matter what their background, but..'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': 'And that’s understandable, no matter what their background. But right now it’s confusing because of the war in Ukraine. And they’re scratching their heads, like what the heck is Russia doing? Should we be helping? I think we should be helping the innocent Ukrainians. But what impact does that have? Do you think the average person, whether they have a PhD or they have any other job sits and thinks, “Wow, there’s thousands of tons of grain in elevators in Ukraine that can’t get out, and Ukraine’s one of the biggest producers of corn or wheat. Huh, I wonder whether that’s the reason my prices are up.”'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (24:37)', 'Speech': 'And do you take any responsibility for the inflation in this country? Do you take any responsibility, your policies?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:43)', 'Speech': 'I think our policies help, not hurt. Think about what they say. The vast majority of the economists think that this is going to be a real tough problem to solve. But it’s not because of spending. We brought down the deficit. The bottom line is how much does America owe? How much in the hole are we going? We’re reducing that.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (25:11)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President [crosstalk 00:25:11].'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:11)', 'Speech': 'One more question.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (25:12)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:25:12] [crosstalk 00:25:12] you had retail gasoline prices and diesel prices at record highs-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:15)', 'Speech': 'Yes.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 6: (25:16)', 'Speech': '… Yet you have yet to ask Americans to consume less. You’re a train guy. Have you ever thought of your administration asking Americans to drive less, to take public transport?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:26)', 'Speech': 'Well, if you ever raised a family like mine, you don’t have to tell them. They’re doing everything in their power to figure out how not to have to show up at the gas pump. That’s why, for example, one of the things that’s going to help a lot, but it’s going to take time, is our infrastructure bill. The truth is they don’t have that many options in terms of transportation around the country right now. If you live in the Northeast Corridor you do, if you’re driving back and forth between Baltimore, Washington, New York, et cetera. But you don’t have many choices. You don’t have a whole lot of choices to deal with other aspects of transportation in terms of local transportation. And so what happens is, and unless they’re electric, we find ourselves the cost of flying and buying a ticket on a plane costs more because of gas prices.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:15)', 'Speech': 'So this is a process, but it’s a process that I’ve been consistent about, wanting to lower prices and shift to renewable energy so we’re not as dependent. I have conversations almost every … Well, that’s an exaggeration, at least twice a week with one of my European counterparts, heads of state on how can we help them, in fact, wean themselves off of Russian oil, because they’re so totally dependent. We’re working like the devil to help them transition because as long as Russia is able to make money selling oil, they’re going to continue to be able to do the bad things they’re doing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:54)', 'Speech': 'So there’s a lot and it’s really complicated.

A caretaker of her husband, bringing him clean clothes, cutting his hair, holding his hand every day she visited him in the nursing home. Heart as big as her head. Pearl Young, 77. A mother, grandmother, missionary of God, a public school teacher who also ran a local food pantry. Loved singing, dancing, and her family.

Both treated with injuries, on a long road to recovery. Individual lives of love, service, and community that speaks to the bigger story of who we are as Americans. A great nation because we’re a good people. Jill and I bring you this message from deep in our nation’s soul. In America, evil will not win, I promise you. Hate will not prevail, and white supremacy will not have the last word. For the evil did come to Buffalo, and it’s come to all too many places, manifested in gunmen who massacred innocent people in the name of hateful and perverse ideology rooted in fear and racism.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:44)', 'Speech': 'It’s taken so much. 10 lives cut short in a grocery store, three other wounded by a hate-filled individual who had driven 200 miles from Binghamton, in that range, to carry out a murderous, racist rampage that he would livestream, livestream to the world. What happened here is simple and straightforward, terrorism. Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:29)', 'Speech': 'A hate that through the media and politics, the internet, has radicalized angry, alienated, lost, and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be replaced, that’s the word, replaced, by the other, by people who don’t look like them and who are therefore, in a perverse ideology that they possess and being fed lesser beings. I and all of you reject the lie. I call on all Americans to reject the lie. And I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain, and for profit, because that’s what it is. We have now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:29)', 'Speech': 'We heard the chants, “You will not replace us,” in Charlottesville, Virginia. I wasn’t going to run as the senator knows, again for President. But when I saw those people coming out of the woods, of the fields in Virginia, in Charlottesville, carrying torches, shouting “You will not replace us,” accompanied by white supremacists and carrying Nazi banners, that’s when I said, “No. No.” And I, honest to God, those who know me, Chuck, you know I wasn’t going to run for certain, but I was going to be darned if I was going to let… Anyway, I don’t want to get going.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:14)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’ve seen the mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina, El Paso, Texas, in Pittsburgh, last year in Atlanta, this week in Dallas, Texas, and now in Buffalo, in Buffalo, New York. White supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison running through… It really is, running through our body politic. And it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more, no more. We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America. None. And look, failure in saying that is going to be complicity. Silence is complicity, it’s complicity. We cannot remain silent.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:19)', 'Speech': 'Our nation’s strength has always come from the idea, it’s going to sound corny, but think about it, what’s the idea of our nation? That we’re all children of God, life, liberty, our universal goods, gifts of God. We didn’t get it from the government, we got it because we exist, and we’re called upon to defend them. The venom of the haters and their weapons of war, the violence in the words and deeds that stalk our streets, our stores, our schools, this venom, this violence cannot be the story of our time. We cannot allow that to happen.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:01)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’m not naïve, I know tragedy will come again. It cannot be forever overcome. It cannot be fully understood either. But there are certain things we can do. We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We’ve done it before. I did it when we passed the crime bill last time. And violence went down, shootings went down. You can’t prevent people from being radicalized to violence, but we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. We just need to have the courage to do that, to stand up.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:43)', 'Speech': 'Look, the American experiment in democracy is in a danger like it hasn’t been in my lifetime. It’s in danger this hour. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America but who don’t understand America. To confront the ideology of hate requires caring about all people, not making distinctions. Reverend, the scripture is seeing that we’re all part of the Divine. “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” That’s the America I know, that Jill knows. And most deserve the most. Look, we are the most multiracial, most dynamic nation in the history of the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:31)', 'Speech': 'Now is the time for the people of all races, from every background, to speak up as a majority in America and reject white supremacy. These actions we’ve seen and these hate-filled attacks represent the views of a hate-filled minority. We can’t allow them to distort America, the real America. We can’t allow them to destroy the soul of the nation. As President of the United States, I travel the world all the time, and other nations ask me, heads of state and other countries ask me, “What’s going on? What in God’s name happened on January 6th? What happened in Buffalo? They’ll ask.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:20)', 'Speech': 'We have to refuse to live in a country where black people going about a weekly grocery shopping can be gunned down by weapons of war deployed in a racist cause. We have to refuse to live in a country where fear and lies are packaged for power and for profit. We must all enlist in this great cause of America. This is work that requires all of us, presidents and politicians, commentators, citizens. None of us can stay in the sidelines. We have to resolve here in Buffalo that from the tragedy, this tragedy, will come hope and light and life. It has to. And on our watch, the sacred cause of America will never bow, never break, never bend. And the America we love, the one we love, will endure.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:20)', 'Speech': 'So, to the families, from your pain, may we find purpose to live a life worthy of the loved ones you lost. From a hymn based on the 91st Psalm I sung at my church, “May He raise you up on eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand.” That’s my wish for us. We can do this if we resolve to do it, if we take on the haters and those who don’t even care, it’s just about profit and politics. May the soul of the fallen rest in peace and rise in glory. And may God guide the United States of America, now and always.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:17)', 'Speech': 'To the families, as my grandpop used to say when I walked out of his home in Scranton, he’d say, “Joey, spread the faith.” And my grandma would yell, “No, Joey.” I mean, he said, “Keep the faith.” And my grandma would say, “No, Joey, spread the faith.” We’re thinking of you. Hold on to each other tightly, stick together, you’ll get through this. And we’ll make Buffalo and the United States a better place to live than it is today.'}]"

That’s to be able to speed up the import of infant formula and start getting more formula in stores as soon as possible.

Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, if it comes to that?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:23)', 'Speech': 'Yes.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (00:24)', 'Speech': 'You are?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:27)', 'Speech': 'That’s the commitment we made. We agreed with The One China Policy, we signed onto it and all the attendant agreements made from there. But the idea that it could be taken by force, just taken by force, is just not appropriate. It’ll dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'Berman: (00:54)', 'Speech': 'The United States already provides defensive weapons to Taiwan, and has previously maintained what is called, strategic ambiguity about intervening militarily in the event of a Chinese attack. The comments this morning seemed a little less ambiguous. As to whether they were strategic, CNN has learned the president’s comments caught his top aids off guard. They are already issuing some clarifications this morning. Beijing issued a response a short time ago as well.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (01:20)', 'Speech': 'The president also announced that 13 nations will be joining a new Asia Pacific economic framework. The goal is to level the economic playing field with China. President Biden also ripping into Vladimir Putin for attempting to eliminate the identity of Ukraine. He says, “Russia must pay a long term price.” When asked about the challenges facing the US economy, the president insisted a recession is not inevitable. CNN Chief White House Correspondent, Kaitlin Collins, traveling with the president. She is live with us now from Tokyo with the very latest here. Kaitlin?'}, {'Time': 'Kaitlin Collins: (01:55)', 'Speech': 'Yeah. There were no conditions when the president made that striking comment about Taiwan, no clarifications that he offered later on, as he was talking about this remarkable position that he had just taken on Taiwan. Somewhere he had gone close to that before, but never this assertive as he was today, during that press conference. Where he said yes, very bluntly, that the United States would come to Taiwan’s aid militarily, should China attack Taiwan. That is of course incredibly significant. It caught some of the president’s own advisors who were in the room off guard, because they did not expect the president to be that unvarnished in his view of what the United States would do if China were to attack Taiwan. Something that the United States obviously has been concerned about, and other allies, including Japan, ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That’s only amplified that. The reason this is so significant is before the United States has warned China against using force in Taiwan, but they’ve been very vague on purpose, purposefully vague, on what they would do if China did, if they did use force in Taiwan.'}, {'Time': 'Kaitlin Collins: (02:58)', 'Speech': 'That has been this purpose, this really intent called strategic ambiguity, where they’re not saying what they would do, what they would not do. President Biden has tiptoed close to that before, only for aides to later walk it back. Shortly after he made these comments today, you did see aides go out and tell CNN, on background of course, which means there is no name attached to it, that the president’s position on Taiwan had not changed. But certainly saying that yes, he would come to their aid militarily is a big change, compared to just simply providing them with defensive weapons, with lethal weapons, like the United States has said they are doing, and would be prepared to do going ahead. So, I think when you look back at what the aides say when they do walk back these comments, there’s only so many times the aides can walk back a comment that the president makes, before it’s very clear what his intent is and what his belief is, should this rise to that matter, if China did attack Taiwan.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (03:50)', 'Speech': 'Yeah. Clearly there’s a shift. I think it’s very obvious as you listen to him, in that case there. It was also really interesting Kaitlin, and I know it was to you as well, Biden’s comments when it came to Ukraine and what President Putin’s goal is there.'}, {'Time': 'Kaitlin Collins: (04:07)', 'Speech': 'Yeah. Of course this was the larger context really of the Taiwan situation, because the president said while he does not believe ultimately that China will invade Taiwan, he was talking about basically how the dynamics have changed. People have been raising the question of the lessons learned from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and what that means. I think that is part of the reason you’ve seen such a strong action by the United States when it comes to arming Ukraine, providing them with all of this weaponry that they’ve been providing them with, is they want it to be a lesson. They know China is watching closely and they want them to be paying attention to how the world is treating Russia. Basically saying, if this is what you do in Taiwan, this is how you will be treated by the rest of the world. The president today, talking about making sure that President Putin is paying a price.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:53)', 'Speech': 'They’re showing bombings of every school. No military purpose. Schools, hospitals, daycare centers, all the things, museums, blowing up all the museums. I believe what Putin’s attempting to do is eliminate the identity of Ukraine, the identity. He can’t occupy it, but he can try to destroy its identity. The reason I bother to mention that is, he has to pay and Russia has to pay a long term price for that.'}, {'Time': 'Kaitlin Collins: (05:28)', 'Speech': 'Those comments there, really showing a lot of the insight into what the president believes is happening here. Saying that he doesn’t believe ultimately Putin will be able to occupy Ukraine, but saying that this goal of what you’re seeing happening on a daily basis, what President Zelensky was just talking about a few moments ago in his address, shows what Putin’s true intent is. Which he said is to eliminate the identity of the Ukrainian people. Of course, this is something that has loomed over almost every conversation the president has had here in Asia.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (05:56)', 'Speech': 'Yeah. Certainly.

The significance?'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Sue Mi Terry: (06:23)', 'Speech': 'Well, it is significant because even the US policy towards China and Taiwan has not changed. We stand by One China Policy. China is not going to take this lightly. This is Biden’s second or third time saying that he might protect Taiwan, or get involved militarily. So, it does send a very strong message, and it is shift. It is a shift because we always practice, US, strategic ambiguity when we’re pressed with this question. So, I’m sure the aides are walking back and they don’t know… They’re trying to manage this because of China.

Not that they don’t believe in… It’s not that China’s vision of Taiwan is different.

If I’m Xi Jinping, I’d think twice about it.'}, {'Time': 'Berman: (08:08)', 'Speech': 'Do you have a sense of how far the United States would be willing to go when it gets involved militarily, as President Biden just promised to do in Taiwan?'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Sue Mi Terry: (08:17)', 'Speech': 'I think for President Biden, it might be different with a different president, but for this president, I think he made it pretty clear.

It’s my pleasure to serve alongside him yet again, ladies and gentlemen, it’s my honor to introduce the 28th United States, secretary defense Lloyd J. Austin III.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (12:54)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, Dr. Biden, vice president Harris, Mr. M. Hoff, fellow members of the cabinet, general Millie and members of the joint chiefs of staff, good afternoon. To our distinguished guests, our service members and my fellow veterans, thank you for letting us share this day with you and to the gold star and surviving families here, you honor us with your presence. I know that when you look across this hollowed ground, you ache for those you have lost your devotion to your loved ones, has never faltered. And in turn America owes all of you support that does not waiver. We renew that dedication every Memorial day.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (14:12)', 'Speech': 'And as we do, we also renew our faith in our democracy and the values of self government that bind us together as Americans. We understand the stakes. In the 21st century, the security of the world hinges again on a survival and success of the American experiment. And in turn that great experiment relies on the American Patriots who volunteer to keep their fellow citizens safe and their nation secure. And these Patriots carry the moral force that can be wielded only by free people defending their inalienable rights and the rule of law.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (15:10)', 'Speech': 'Today on the battle fills of Ukraine, the world, again sees the power of democratic citizens and soldiers to defy tyranny, cruelty, and oppression. Their freedom is under attack. And so is the international order rooted in the rules that we have built since world war II at such terrible costs. We understand the challenge, and we’re determined to meet it. As the president says in the battle between democracy and autocracies, democracies arising to the moment. We draw inspiration from the unity of our allies and partners, and we draw strength from the men and women of the United States military.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (16:04)', 'Speech': 'In the years, since we last gathered on the solemn day, America’s longest war has come to a close. And today we remember the 2,461 American service members and personnel who fell in Afghanistan. And we remember all those who still carry the wounds of that war, to body and to soul, we hold them in our hearts, alongside the Patriots, across generations who gave their lives to defend us all. The heroes here are joined together, united not just by their final resting place, but by their devotion to the values that gave life to our democracy. And they came from every state, from every territory, from every background and from every creed, but they were all Patriots who loved their country, who marched to defend our democracy and who fought to forge a more perfect union. Their sacrifice demands more than even our deepest gratitude.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (17:22)', 'Speech': 'In the words of president Kennedy, who rest nearby, “We must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” So as we honor our fallen today, let us live by their dedication, to democracy, to Liberty, and to the constitution. When choosing between what is easy and what is right, let us live by the example of our fallen warriors. And when the values that we hold dear are put to the test, let us live by the ideals that they gave their lives to defend. Today we hold the fallen in our prayers and every day we strive to make them proud. Thank you again for being here today.'}, {'Time': 'Lloyd J. Austin III: (18:18)', 'Speech': 'And ladies and gentlemen, our commander in chief has been a staunch and steadfast champion, our men and women in of our men and women in uniform. And I know personally how much he values their sacrifice, their commitment, and how devoted he is to our men and women in uniform and to the families who serve alongside him. He has spent a lifetime in public service to advance the democratic ideals for which so many have given so much. It is my honor to introduce the president of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:01)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. They lie here, glory and honor in quiet rose in Arlington, in cemeteries in Europe that I’ve visited. Many of you have been graves across our country, in towns, large and small, America’s beloved daughters and sons who dared all, risked all, and gave all to preserve and defend an idea, unlike any other in human history, the idea of the United States of America, and today as a nation, we undertake a sacred ritual to reflect and remember, because if we forget-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:03)', 'Speech': 'To reflect and remember, because if we forget the lives that each of those silent markers represent, mothers, fathers, siblings, spouses, children, if we forget what they sacrificed, what they made so that our nation might endure strong, free, and united, then we forget who we are, who we are. Ladies and gentlemen, our First Lady, the love of my life, Jill, Vice President Harris, the Second Gentleman, Secretary Austin, General Milley, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Cabinet members, Gold Star families most importantly, and survivors, today we renew our sacred vow. It’s a simple vow, to remember. To remember.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:56)', 'Speech': 'Memorial Day is always a day where pain and pride are mixed together. We all know it, sitting here. Jill and I know it. Today’s the day our son died. And, folks, for those who have lost a loved one in the service of our country, if your loved one is missing or unaccounted for, I know the ceremonies reopen that black hole in the center of your chest that just pulls you in, suffocates you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:36)', 'Speech': 'I said seven years ago today, our son, Major Beau Biden, took his last breath at Walter Reed. A major in the Delaware Army National Guard, he insisted on deploying to Iraq with his unit for a year when he was attorney general. Came home a decorated soldier, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Delaware’s Conspicuous Service Cross. He didn’t die in the line of duty. He came home from Iraq with cancer. It was a horrific cancer that stole us from him, and him from us, but still, it always feels to me on Memorial Day I see him, not as he was the last time I held his hand, but the day I pinned his bars on him as a second lieutenant. I see him with me down at the Delaware Memorial Bridge, hugging all the Gold Star families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:32)', 'Speech': 'Days like this bring back, before your eyes, their smile and their laugh. The last conversation you had, each of you know it. The hurt can be overwhelming, but for so many of you, as is with Jill and me, the hurt is wrapped around the knowledge that your loved one was part of something bigger, bigger than any of us. They chose a life of purpose. Sounds corny, like a Memorial Day speech, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart. They chose a life of purpose. They had a mission, and above all, they believed in duty. They believed in honor. They believed in their country. And still today, we are free because they were brave. We live by the light of the flame of liberty that they kept burning, and so a part of them is still with us, no matter how long ago we lost them. As hard as it is for many to believe, especially those whose loss is still raw, I promise you the day will come when the memory of your loved one, your patriot, will bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. That’s when you know you’re going to make it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:07)', 'Speech': 'Today, American service members stand watch around the world, and, as many of you know, at often a great personal risk. And this Memorial Day, we know the memory is still painful of all the fallen who lost their lives during the last two decades in combat, each of them leaving behind a family, a community, hearts broken by their absence, and lives that will never be the same. We see in the hundreds of graves here in Section 60 at Arlington reminder that there’s nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it. 7,054 American military members gave their lives over 20 years of our Iraq and Afghan conflicts. Untold others died of injuries and illness connected to their service and these wars, and the enduring grief born by the survivors is a cost of war that we’ll carry as a nation forever.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:24)', 'Speech': 'And so to every Gold Star family, to every survivor and family member and caregiver, this grateful nation owes you as well as that person you lost, and we can never repay the sacrifice, but we will never stop trying. We’ll never fail in our duty to remember. With their lives they bought our freedom, and so with our lives, we must always live up to their example, putting service before self, caring for our neighbors as ourselves, working fervently to bring our union just that much closer to fulfilling the founding creed, as the Secretary said, that all women and men are created equal. I’ve often said that, as a nation, we have many obligations, but the only one that is truly sacred, the only truly sacred obligation we have, is to prepare and equip those women and men we send into harm’s way, and care for them and their families when they return home and when they don’t. This is an obligation that unites Americans. It brings us together, to make sure the women and men who are willing to lay down their lives for us get the very best from us in return.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:56)', 'Speech': 'I want to acknowledge that we’re making progress in key areas like comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that is advancing in Congress that will deliver healthcare services and benefits to veterans and their survivors impacted by toxic exposures. We don’t know how many Americans and service members may have died because of what they were exposed to on the battlefield, toxic smoke from burn pits near where they were based, burn pits that incinerated the wastes of war, medical and hazardous material, jet fuel, and so much more. We have a duty to do right by them, and I’m determined to make sure that our brave service families and members that served alongside them do not wait decades for the care and benefits that they deserve, and that’s why. That’s why we’re working so hard to find out what the facts are. Where we can still save lives, we have to act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:59)', 'Speech': 'All of us also have a duty to renew our commitment to the foundational values of our nation in their honor, for those are the values that have inspired generation after generation to service. On Friday, I spoke at the graduation and commissioning of… ceremony of the US Naval Academy. Had an opportunity to do that before as well. It was a remarkable experience again, an honor, looking out at those young men and women, newly commissioned officers embarking on a life of service. They hold before them the example of the heroes who have gone before them, many of your family members, heroes who’ve answered duty’s call at Lexington and Concord, Antietam and Gettysburg, Belleau Woods, the Battle of the Bulge, in Korea and Vietnam and Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many other places around the world, so many of whom never returned home, including the legacy of all those held prisoners of war or who are still missing in action.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:15)', 'Speech': 'To be here today, soon after that joyful celebration at the Academy, is a bracing reminder of all that we ask of our service members and their families, for it’s on the strong shoulders and noble spirits of our service members that our freedom is built, our democracy sustained. And in this moment, when a war of aggression is once more being waged by Russia to snuff out the freedom, the democracy, the very culture and identity of neighboring Ukraine, we see so clearly all that’s at stake. Freedom has never been free. Democracy has always required champions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (30:03)', 'Speech': '… free. Democracy has always required champions. Today, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the front lines fighting to save their nation, but their fight is part of a larger fight that unites all people. There’s a fight that so many of the patriots whose eternal rest is here in these hallowed grounds were part of, a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between appetites and ambition of a few who forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many. A battle for essential democratic principles, the rule of law, free and fair elections, freedom to speak and write and to assemble, freedom to worship as one chooses, freedom of the press, principles that are essential for a free society.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:03)', 'Speech': 'I’ve heard this a lot. I’ve heard this a lot over the years, but we’re now realizing how real it is around the world in so many countries, as I speak. These are the foundations of our great experiment, but they are never guaranteed, even here in America. Every generation has to defeat democracy’s mortal foes, and into every generation heroes are born, willing to shed their blood for that which they and we hold dear. Ladies and gentlemen, today we remember, and we reaffirm, freedom is worth the sacrifice. Democracy is not perfect. It’s never been perfect. But it’s worth fighting for, if necessary, worth dying for. It’s more than just our form of government. It’s part of very soul of America. The soul of America. Our democracy is our greatest gift as a nation, made holy by those we’ve lost along the way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (32:18)', 'Speech': 'Our democracy is how we undertake the constant work of perfecting the union. And we have not perfected it, but we’ve never stopped trying, of opening the doors wider of opportunity and prosperity and justice for people everywhere. Our democracy is how we endure through every challenge, overcome every obstacle we faced through the last 246 years of self-government, and how we’ve come back stronger than before. We must never walk away from that. We must never betray the lives laid down to make our nation a beacon to the world, a citadel of liberty and justice for everybody. This is the mission of our time. Our memorial to them must not be just a day when we pause and pray, it must be a daily commitment to act, to come together, to be worthy of the price that was paid.

With today’s excellent jobs report and unemployment remaining at near historic lows of 3.6%, I want to speak very briefly today about our economy and what we’re doing to lower the cost for American families. I know that, even with today’s good news, a lot of Americans remain anxious, and I understand the feeling.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (00:23)', 'Speech': 'I grew up in a family about 100 miles from here that, if the price of gas went up, you felt it. It was a discussion at the kitchen table. There’s no denying that high prices particularly around gasoline and food are a real problem for people. But there’s every reason for the American people to feel confident that we’ll meet these challenges. Because of the enormous progress we’ve made on the economy, the Americans can tackle inflation from a position of strength, still a problem we can tackle from position of strength. The purpose that we’ve set out to accomplish and the progress we’ve made I think is critical.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (01:00)', 'Speech': 'At the time I took office, about 16 months ago, the economy had stalled and COVID was out of control. Today, thanks to the economic plan and the vaccination plan that my administration put in action, America has achieved the most robust recovery in modern history, just two years removed from the worst economic crisis since The Great Depression. The job market is as strongest it’s been since just after World War II. We’ve got more evidence of that today.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (01:27)', 'Speech': 'We learned that, in May, the economy added 390,000 new jobs, bringing the total sense I took office to 8.7 million new jobs. An all-time record. We learned that more Americans entered the labor force in May. In fact, working age people have come back into the workforce at a faster rate in this recovery than at any point in the last 40 years. That means that the unemployment rate is near historic lows. And the number of Americans on unemployment benefits has gone from record highs to record lows with millions of Americans moving up to better jobs with better pay, and American manufacturing is booming. 600,000 new manufacturing jobs created since I took office. But it isn’t only about jobs.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:12)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, families are carrying less debt. Their average savings are up. A recent survey from the Federal Reserve found that more Americans feel financially comfortable than any time since the survey began in 2013. That confidence and comfortability is part of the reason why Americans applied to start more new small businesses last year than ever before in American history. Because of our historically strong growth, we have strengthened Medicare and social security programs that millions of American families rely on.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:47)', 'Speech': 'Yesterday, I learned that social security and Medicare trust funds will be able to pay benefits for longer than previously projected before we passed the American Rescue Plan. The reason, a faster than expected recovery in jobs, earnings, economic growth. It’s all strengthening the financial prospects for these bedrock programs. In fact, America’s in a stronger economic position today than just about any other country in the world. Independent experts have projected that the US economy could grow faster than China’s economy this year. That hasn’t happened since 1976, nearly one half century ago.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:25)', 'Speech': 'The point is this. We’ve laid an economic foundation that’s historically strong, and now we’re moving forward to a new moment where we can build on that foundation, build a future of stable, steady growth so we can bring down inflation without sacrificing all the historic gains we’ve made. That’s what we’re beginning to see in today’s jobs report. With today’s numbers, the jobs over the last three months have averaged about 400,000 jobs per month. That’s historically robust and a sign we’re beginning to shift to steady growth after rapidly recovering 600,000 jobs per month over the prior six months.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:04)', 'Speech': 'As we move to a new period of stable, steady growth, we should expect to see more moderation. We aren’t likely to see the kind of blockbuster job reports month after month like we had over this past year, but that’s a good thing. That’s a sign of a healthy economy with steady growth, rising wages for working families, everyday cost easing up, and shrinking the deficit. That stability puts us in a strong position to tackle what is clearly a problem inflation.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:35)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been very clear that fighting inflation is my top economic priority. On Tuesday, I spoke about one element of my inflation plan. Giving the Federal Reserve the space they need to operate. Today, I’d like to address the two additional elements of my plan to tackle inflation. One, bringing down the cost of everyday goods for families. And two, bringing down the federal deficit at the same time. Bringing down the cost, here’s where we stand. The two challenges on the minds of most working families are prices at the pump and prices at the grocery store. Both of these challenges have been directly exacerbated by Putin’s war in Ukraine. The price of gas is up $1.40 since the beginning of the year when Putin began amassing troops at the Ukrainian border. This is a Putin price hike.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:29)', 'Speech': 'Putin’s war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world’s major bread baskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world. Ukraine has 20 million tons of grain in storage right now, and it’s been in storage since the last harvest. Normally, that would’ve already been exported into the world market. But because of Putin’s invasion and blockade of the port which they could take that grain out for the rest of the world, it’s not. It’s not.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:03)', 'Speech': 'Look, I understand that families who are struggling probably don’t care why the prices are up. They just want them to go down. “Joe, what are you going to do to bring them down?” But it’s important that we understand the root of the problem so we can take steps to solve it.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:18)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been upfront with the American people from the outset, that there would be a cost here at home of Putin’s decision to brutally and savagely invade a sovereign nation. But as your president, I remain committed to doing everything in my power to blunt the impact on American families. That’s exactly what I’m doing. I led the world to coordinate the largest release of global oil reserves in history, 240 million barrels, to boost global supply and keep prices from rising even more. I directed the sale of gasoline using homegrown biofuels this summer, and I’m working closely with our European partners to get more of the grain locked in Ukraine right now out into the world market which could help bring down prices. There’s ways to do that over land, which we could talk about at another time. But actions have already helped to blunt that what would have been an even larger Putin price hike.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:18)', 'Speech': 'As I said, I’m going to continue to use every tool available to me to further blunt those price hikes as we move forward. But the fact is this. There’s more than one way to solve this problem. If food and gas prices are going to be elevated by Putin’s price hike, one way we can make things a little better for families is by helping them save on other basic items their family needs on a monthly basis. Like their utility bills, their internet bills, their prescription drug bills, and other costs like housing.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:50)', 'Speech': 'My goal is to make sure that the end of the month, families have a little more breathing room than they have now. For example, here’s something we can do right now. Congress would help ease the cost for families right away by passing my clean energy investment proposal that I proposed that’s been sitting there. Things like tax credits for businesses to produce clean energy. The tax cuts for families to make their homes more energy efficient. That’s what it results in.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:19)', 'Speech': 'I met with nearly a dozen CEOs of America’s largest utility companies, such as Southern Company and American Electric Power. They told me that if we pass the investments, they’ll immediately lower the average family’s energy cost by about $500 a year. That would help a lot. That’d make up for a lot. In the long run, it would help families make America truly energy independent. So in the future, American families are no longer subject to the whims of a dictator half a world away controlling oil.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:53)', 'Speech': 'It’s not just utility bills though. I laid out a plan to lower prescription drug cost by giving Medicare the power to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies and how much they can charge just like they do with the Veterans Administration. Right now, they say, “We’re not going to pay more than X amount of dollars for your insulin.” Well, they can decide not to sell it at all, or they can sell it at the price that the government says they’ll pay for it, bringing down the average cost of prescription drugs. By capping that cost of insulin, by the way, at no more than $35 a month. It costs them less than 10 bucks to make it. In some families, it means hundreds of dollars a month, and sometimes hundreds of dollars a year, depending on what ailment they’re trying to deal with. Someone with diabetes, for example, it’s hundreds of dollars per year. Someone with arthritis, it could be thousands of dollars per year.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:45)', 'Speech': 'I’ve laid out a plan to lower rent and mortgage costs. The largest cost most families face, around a third of a typical family’s budget, because we have a shortage of housing. Building more than a million more housing units and closing the shortfall and affordable housing in this country will do that. I’ve laid out a plan to lower the cost of high speed internet by working with the 20 leading internet service providers to cut their prices and raise their speeds for tens of millions of households. This could lower what they have to pay for high speed internet by $50 a month or more. Nearly 40% of households in America qualify for these savings. By the way, you can find out if you’ll be eligible by visiting getinternet.gov. Getinternet.gov. I’ll say it again. Getinternet.gov. See if you qualify.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:39)', 'Speech': 'I’ve laid out a plan to lower the cost of everyday goods that move through our supply chains to stores and families’ doorsteps. For example, at the State of the Union, I called on Congress to crack down on foreign-owned shipping companies that have raised their prices to transport goods by as much as 1000%. 1000%. That obviously raises the cost of the goods on those ships to consumers.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:06)', 'Speech': 'The Senate has passed legislation and I’m hopeful the House can do the same to send me legislation in the coming weeks to crack down on these companies and help lower overall cost. My plan does all this without raising a penny in taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year, and without raising the deficit at all by taxing the super wealthy and big corporations, like the 55 major corporations that don’t pay a single penny in taxes even though they had a $40 billion in profits.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:37)', 'Speech': 'The point is this. I’m doing everything I can on my own to help working families during this stretch of higher prices. I’m going to continue to do that, but Congress needs to act as well. We can do so much more if we come together to lower the cost for American families. But my congressional Republican friends led by Rick Scott have a different approach. He’s actually introduced a plan. He wants to raise taxes on working families by an average of $1,500 a year, put Medicare and social security… Medicaid. Excuse me. Social security and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years. In other words, every five years, they’re going to no longer exist unless they vote them back into existence. I disagree with that. What in God’s name are they doing? I want to work with anyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent, to deliver real solutions and real savings for the American people, not take money out of their pockets.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:36)', 'Speech': 'Now, the other element I’d like to address that has impacts on inflation is to lower the deficit. The reason this matters to families is because reducing the deficit is another way to ease inflation. My friends on the Republican side like to paint me as the big spender. But let’s look at the facts. Facts matter. Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year he was in office. Under my plan, we’re on track to cut the federal deficit this year by $1.7 trillion. You hear me now? This year, by $1.7 trillion. That’s a fact. The largest decline in American history. By the way, those aren’t White House projections. They come from the nonpartisan congressional budget office that you and the press and everyone around the country legitimately quotes all the time. That progress on tackling the deficit was not preordained.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:36)', 'Speech': 'It was my economic strategy, built into our historic recovery, that we didn’t anticipate a war in Ukraine at the time, historic economic growth, and not only to help tens of millions of families move up, it has helped our federal deficit come down. Now, because of that strategy, we’re on track for a deficit to take up a lower share of our economy than it did before the pandemic.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:00)', 'Speech': 'In fact, the Treasury Department is planning to pay down, pay down the national debt this quarter, which never happened under my predecessor. Not once. Not once. Because unlike my predecessor, the deficits come down both years I’ve been here. I propose a plan to keep shrinking that deficit by making common sense reforms to our tax code, leveling the playing field internationally so that the biggest companies no longer have an incentive to shift jobs overseas, to shift them overseas to make their product because they get charged less in taxes and avoid paying their fair share of taxes here at home. We’ve put together a multi nation initiative that I’m hopeful will come into play at the G7. Ending the outrageous unfairness of our tax system allows billionaires… Look, if you can make a billion dollars, I’m all for it. Just pay a little bit of your fair share, you know? Just pay your fair share. Billionaires pay a lower rate than a teacher or a firefighter.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:02)', 'Speech': 'The bottom line is this. Part of the reason I ran for president is because I was tired of trickle down economics. It doesn’t work. My plan is to produce the strongest, fastest, most widespread economic recovery America has ever experienced with record jobs, new record small businesses, and wages rising. It’s the foundation for an economy that works for working families. Because of that foundation, we’re better positioned than any country in the world to overcome global inflation that we’re seeing and reach a new chapter of stable and steady growth.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:38)', 'Speech': 'Let’s come together and focus on what matters. Let’s build on the extraordinary progress we’ve made. Let’s continue to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. When that happens, everybody does well, including the very wealthy. Thank you and God bless you and may God protect our troops. I’ll take a few questions.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (15:58)', 'Speech': 'Are you going to Saudi Arabia?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (16:00)', 'Speech': 'Are you going Saudi Arabia, Mr. President? Are you going to Saudi Arabia?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (16:03)', 'Speech': 'Elon Musk has said that he has a super bad feeling about the US economy’s laying off 10% of his workforce. What do you say to Elon Musk about his feeling about the economy? Jamie Diamond has said similar things.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:15)', 'Speech': 'Well, let me tell you. While Elon Musk is talking about that, Ford is increasing their investment overwhelmingly. I think Ford is increasing the investment in building new electric vehicles, 6,000 new employees, union employees I might add, in the Midwest.

Thanks to all of the lawmakers and advocates who helped make this day possible.'}, {'Time': 'Denis: (00:50)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, thank you for inviting our terrific VA team to the White House for this signing. Like the veterans we serve and the country they’ve defended our team as strong and diverse, I’m proud to be part of that team, which includes importantly, our inspector general tough advocate for vets. And I’m grateful you invited us today.'}, {'Time': 'Denis: (01:10)', 'Speech': 'We VA believe we have the best mission in government. And with veterans like Colonel Gail Halvorsen to serve, you see why. With the signing of today’s bills, Colonel Halvorsen’s story will be memorialized forever. During the Berlin airlift, pilots like Halvorsen established an air bridge into Germany that broke the Soviet effort at isolating West Berlin, and Halvorsen did something more. First with candy from his own ration, then with that of his battle buddies and ultimately with candy donated by Americans back home, Halvorsen took it upon himself to airdrop over 23 tons of candy to the children of Berlin, earning him the affectionate title of [foreign language 00:01:58] or The Candy Bomber. That act of kindness paired with our nation’s advocacy for freedom, helped convince a generation of young Berliners that we would stand with them always and forged a relationship that stands strong to this day.'}, {'Time': 'Denis: (02:15)', 'Speech': 'It’s not hard to see a through line from those days to today’s American led commitment to freedom in Ukraine. Mr. President, the bills you’re signing today not only memorialize Colonel Halvorsen, but help VA better serve vets like him. In your State of the Union, you challenged us to cut through partisanship and get things done for veterans. Well, these bills are the unity agenda in action. This day was made possible because of your leadership and because as our president and the head of a military family yourself, nobody better understands our nation’s sacred obligation to all those we serve.'}, {'Time': 'Denis: (02:56)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my distinct honor and pleasure to introduce to you a great friend of America’s veterans, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:07)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Well, it’s good to see you all. Denis, the secretary, thank you very much for that introduction, but more importantly, as a lot of the senators here know, for me and my friend for a long time, and thank you for joining the administration. When I was forming the administration, I knew Denis could do any job in the administration, but he wanted to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs because it mattered so much to him. And I think the most important thing to have someone in charge of that department was somebody who cares, cares about what he or she is going to do. I knew he’d pull every lever to deliver results to military veterans and their families. And that’s exactly what he’s done.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:06)', 'Speech': 'I also want to thank all the veteran service organizations here today. I’m going to ask you all the stand. I’m not going to read your names out now, but all the organizations of the veterans organizations please stand. Thank you. Before we leave today and we finish, I want to thank each one of you personally, because you just keep it going for us. You are the most valuable thing the veterans have. I mean it sincerely. So thank you. We owe you a great deal and all the families owe you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:44)', 'Speech': 'And the Democratic and Republican sponsors as well, especially the leaders of our veterans committee, Big Jon Tester, Jon, thank you very much old buddy, and Senator Moran. And thank you as well as Takano. And Walsh is also here. Where are you? Where is everybody? There you go. Okay. You guys have four ready across. Okay. I need glasses. When I look out, the only thing I see is Joe Manchin. Hey Joe, how are you? God, I wish I had Joe’s hair.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:22)', 'Speech': 'All Kidding aside, all friends, look, y’all did so much to make this state possible all of you. And you’re critical to the passage of the PAC Act, which is on the floor right now. And the act would extend benefits and services of those exposed to burn pits and toxic substances during military services, service, I should say, and we need your support to get it passed. And in my State of the Union address, I laid out a unity agenda, four big things that all of us Democrats, Republicans and independents could tackle together as a nation. First was the opioid crisis, second was mental health, third was cancer, and the fourth was supporting our veterans.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:01)', 'Speech': 'Today, our administration is delivering on that agenda. In just a moment, I’ll be signing nine different bills with overwhelming bipartisan support that improve care for our veterans and honor their service and their sacrifice. And you’ve heard me say it many times before, our nation has many obligations. It only has one truly sacred obligation. And I mean it and I’ve been saying this for over 35 years, sacred obligation. And that’s prepare and equip those we send them into harm’s way and to care for them and their families when they come home. It’s a sacred obligation, because veterans are the backbone, the spine of who we are as a country. Less than 1% of the population risk everything to defend our nation and our values and everything we hold dear. The 99% of us who don’t, we owe them, we owe them big. And that’s what today’s all about is paying a debt in my view.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:58)', 'Speech': 'The United States and the State of the Union I talked about, we need to talk about burn pits that incinerate waste of war, tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuels and so much more I won’t even mention. Toxic smoke with thick poisons spreading through our bases and into the lungs of our troops. And when they came home, many of the fittest and best trained warriors we’ve ever had were not the same, headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer. My son Beau was one of them.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:29)', 'Speech': 'Under Secretary McDonough leadership, the VA is pioneering new ways to link toxic exposure to diseases and to help more veterans get the care they need. Earlier this year, we expanded the eligibility for veterans suffering from nine rare respiratory cancers. But current law does not entitle at all toxic exposed veterans to mammogram services does now. Until today, the bill I’m signing, the law will ensure the veterans who served near burn pits get the preventative care they need. It’s named after Kate Hendricks Thomas and her husband and her handsome son is here today with two cousins. Two cousins, right? Welcome guys. Thanks for coming.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:15)', 'Speech': 'And I know when you said you had to go and sit in the front row in front of the president and all the pressure on what am I going to do? What am I doing? But I’m really glad you’re here. We really are, because it’s the root of a dad, it’s all about them, it’s all about them. Marie and military police officer who was a deployed in Iraq, diagnosed with stage four breast cancer from a mammogram, she advocated for women and men in the military to have access to such life saving screenings. Sadly, she lost her battle in April. Gone too soon, but her legacy is going to live on forever. Our hearts are with Dr. Hendricks Thomas’s family. And as I said are here today and other survivors, other cancer survivors.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:11)', 'Speech': 'Another bill improves breast imaging services for veterans, regardless of whether they’re exposed to burn pits or not. Another extends the law that sunsets next month to compensate Americans who develop cancer and medical conditions from the nation’s World War II era nuclear programs. Beyond medical support for our veterans, several other bills honor our members in uniform and those who fought tirelessly on their behalf. The congressional gold medal is going to go to US Army Ranger veterans of World War II Rangers, who played a critical role in the D-Day invasion and Normandy which began 78 years ago, yesterday.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:55)', 'Speech': 'This elite group once numbered 7,000, but now it’s down to 12, a dozen left. On behalf of our nation, we want to thank them for their heroism and their service. As a point of personal privilege is my honor to sign a bill that will name the new VA outpatient clinic that will be billed in Hawaii after a dear friend of mine and a former Senate colleague who I work with. And Macy’s here as well. But Danny Kaka, Danny was a great friend. He was an army veteran of World War II and a former chair of the committee and veteran’s affairs. One of the finest people I ever served with. He really was a man of great honor and integrity.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:40)', 'Speech': 'Today, I’m also signing a bill dedicated to veteran center in Utah in honor of Colonel Gail Halvorsen known as The Candy Bomber. You heard about it, as Denis just talked about. And I’m signing a bill that makes it easier to continue honoring veterans who have a building named after them when the VA switches properties. In other words, if there’s a named building and the property’s being abandoned, whatever building they’re moving into, that will take on the same name. We’ll have to go through the process of getting it authorized again.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:10)', 'Speech': 'The remaining bills focus not just on our veterans past, but the success of their future. We’re going to strengthen the oversight of the VA’s activities so veterans get the care they deserve and restoring educational assistance benefits. So veterans displaced by COVID-19 can continue to gain new skills to meet the demands and changing the workforce.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:35)', 'Speech': 'Look, let me close with this. Last week, we commemorated Memorial Day. And a reminder that our veterans and our military families represent literally the best of America. We can never fully repay the debt to all of you, but I promise that my administration will always have your back. I made that commitment when I ran and I commit that now. And the men and women sitting me for me made a similar commitment. We mean it. This is something we Bidens take personally. Every veteran and family member of a veteran who serves has made our lives, our liberty and our very nation possible, we owe you and we thank you. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:20)', 'Speech': 'And with that, now I’m going to go and sign those nine bills. And at some point, I don’t know, I’m no longer doing advanced work, Jon, but I got to get you all up here for the signing. We’ll work that out. So thank you. And again, kids, thank you for being here. Okay. Thank you very much. Maybe I can talk to you afterwards. Will you talk to me later? Okay. All right. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:12:48].'}]"

No! No fossil fuel. [crosstalk 00:00:10].'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (00:09)', 'Speech': 'I follow some difficult acts, but never before have I followed such a difficult act as I’ve seen the last 45 minutes up here. It’s my honor to host my fellow leaders from throughout our hemisphere for the ninth Summit of the Americas. At a moment when we need more cooperation, common purpose, and transformative ideas that have never been a greater need than today. I also want to welcome all the representatives from civil society, the private sector, international institutions, and especially young people from across the Americas who are participating in this summit. Democracy is a hallmark of our region. Our inter-American democratic charter, which grew out in the third Summit of the Americas, captures our unique commitment to democracy as a region. It affirms the right of people throughout the Americas to democracy, and our obligation as governments to promote and defend democracy. As we meet again today in a moment when democracy is under assault around the world, let us unite again and renew our conviction that democracy is not only the defining feature of American histories, but the essential ingredient to America’s futures.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (01:35)', 'Speech': 'Folks, to state the obvious, our region is large and diverse. We don’t always agree on everything, but because we’re democracies, we work through our disagreements with mutual respect and dialogue. At this summit, we have an opportunity for us to come together around some bold ideas, ambitious actions, and to demonstrate to our people the incredible power of democracies deliver concrete benefits and make life better for everyone. Everyone. And no longer is this a question of what will we do? What will the United States do for the Americas? The question is what we can accomplish by working together, as true partners with diverse capabilities, but equal and mutual respect. Recognizing both our individual sovereignty and our shared responsibilities. The COVID-19 pandemic hit our region particularly hard. While we account for just 12% of the global population, we experienced more than 40% reported global pandemic related deaths. It’s an enormous tragedy that has left too many families grief stricken. An ensuing economic crisis triggered by the pandemic ravaged economies throughout the hemisphere, wiping out much of the hard earned progress we had made.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:07)', 'Speech': '22 million more people fell into poverty in just the first year of the pandemic. Inequity continues to rise. Global inflammatory pressures were made worse by Putin’s brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine and making it harder for families to make ends meet. And all these factors are contributing to vastly increased migration flows throughout our hemisphere, with too many people feeling there is no option available to them to provide for themselves and their families. These challenges affect all of us. All of our nations have a responsibility to step up and ease the pressure people are feeling today. In the months leading up to this summit countries have made meaningful and concrete commitments to address these challenges. And the United States is attempting to do our part as well. Yesterday, we launched our Cities Forward Initiative, recognizing the key roles of mayors and local governments, the role they play in delivering for the people where they live. And we’ll host the inaugural City Summoning of the Americas in Denver in 2023.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:28)', 'Speech': 'Earlier today, we announced a new America Health Corp with 50,000 public health and medical professionals being trained in the region over the next five years, to help strengthen our health systems throughout the hemisphere. In the next few days, we’ll be rolling out another new initiative, creating in cooperation with many of your countries. It includes the U.S. – Caribbean partnership to address the climate crisis, which the Vice President Harris will lead for our country. And the collaboration among the United States… The United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Mexico, the hemisphere’s largest exporters of food to increase food production for export as well as increased fertilizer production for transportation, transportation.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:18)', 'Speech': 'Our leaders, all of us, as we discuss ways to better target more than a half a billion dollars of the United States is devoting increasing security for our citizens. Working with partners to disrupt transnational criminal organizations, go after drug traffickers and elicit firearms, advancing anti-corruption efforts, and strengthening the rule of law. And tonight I’m announcing a new economic partnership. The bills on all the work we have done with the region and will guide our engagement going forward. We’re calling it America’s Partnership for Economic Prosperity. And it’s grounded on the same core values that my administration is bringing to our own strong economic recovery and to bolster long-term economic competitiveness in the United States. First, the American partnership will help economies grow from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. What’s true. What’s true in the United States is true in every country. Trickle down economics does not work.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:31)', 'Speech': 'But when we invest in strengthening workers and the middle class, the poor have a ladder up, and those at the top do just fine. That’s how we can increase opportunity and decrease persistent inequity. We need to break the cycle where marginalized communities are hit the hardest by disasters and have the fewest resources to recover from crises and prepare for the next one. Together, we have to invest in making sure our trade is sustainable and responsible in creating supply chains that are more resilient, more secure, and more sustainable. By working with close friends who share our values, we can make sure that we are not left vulnerable to unexpected shocks while generating economic opportunity for the people in our region. The second, the America’s Partnership will foster innovation, help governments deliver for their own people. People everywhere expect their government to help give them just a little bit of breathing room, provide opportunities for work that pays a decent wage, educate children so they can rise as high as their talents can take them, make communities more secure, so families feel safe in their homes and individuals know their rights will be respected.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:05)', 'Speech': 'That means directing investment to help governments deliver on those responsibilities, including modernizing multilateral development banks to better address the challenges of today and the future. For example, many countries in our region have prospered overall, making it harder for them to secure development lending, but they struggle with deep inequity. I’m proposing the fundamental reforms of the Inter-American Development Bank group. And the United States is ready to put our new capital in the bank’s private sector lending arm, the IDP Investment, to help capitalize on the critical flow of private capital in the region, especially to those startup digital connectivity, renewable energy and health. Third, the American Partnership will tackle the climate crisis head on with the same mentality we’re bringing to the work in the United States. When I hear climate, I think jobs. Good paying, high quality jobs will help speed our transition to a green economy of the future and unleash sustainable growth. Jobs in developing and deploying clean energy. Jobs in decarbonizing the economy. Jobs in protecting biodiversity of our hemisphere. Jobs provide dignity of being able to feed your family, give your children a better life and envision a future of possibilities.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:44)', 'Speech': 'That’s what this is all about. Responding to basic human desires that we share for dignity, for safety, for security. And when those basics are absent in one place, that’s when people make the desperate decision to seek them elsewhere. So on Friday we’ll also come together to launch a Los Angeles declaration, a groundbreaking integrated new approach to manage migration and sharing responsibility across the hemisphere. The declaration represents a mutual commitment to invest in regional solutions that enhance stability, increase opportunities for safe and orderly migration through the region, and crack down on criminal and human trafficking, who prey on desperate people.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:39)', 'Speech': 'Safe and orderly migration is good for all of our economies, including in the United States. It can be a catalyst for sustainable growth. But all unlawful migration is not acceptable. We will enforce our borders including through innovative, coordinated action with our regional partners. We’ve come a long way together since the United States hosted the first Summit of The Americas 28 years ago. But the spirit of Miami, as it was known, the sense of hope and new possibilities that define that first summit remains key to facing the challenge of today and unlocking incredible potential that exists in this hemisphere in the Americas. There’s no reason why the Western hemisphere shouldn’t be secure, prosperous, and democratic. From Canada’s Northern most reaches to the Southern tips of Chile. We have all the tools we need right here in our own hemisphere. Our people are dynamic and innovating. Our nations are committed to working in partnership. And our regions forever knit together by the close bonds of family and enduring friendship.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:53)', 'Speech': 'We see here in Los Angeles, as you heard earlier, a city that has been shaped from its earliest as days and strengthened over the decades by the rich and diverse contributions from people of all our nations. It’s written in the murals, the markets, the thoroughfares that crisscross the city. Bearing witness to the history, struggle, and indomitable spirit of the people of the Americans. This city is testament to the connections that bind us and our capacity to achieve great things together. So tonight, let’s enjoy a wonderful celebration. Let us leave here renewed with purpose and a renewed partnership. And tomorrow let’s get to work building the future this region deserve. Thank you all. And again, welcome, welcome, welcome.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (12:47)', 'Speech': 'This country has the most global [inaudible 00:13:10] per capita. Which country? Saint Lucia.'}]"

And in some ways we’ve moved backwards.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:31)', 'Speech': 'Well, in climate change, we’ve actually made some real moves.

But we only have 50, and you can’t get even two, three, four Republicans to vote.

It’s-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:53)', 'Speech': 'Well, it is screwed up, but we are only a few votes away from being able to straighten it out.

How many do you think the tax code is fair anywhere along the line here? No, I’m not being facetious now, I’m being deadly earnest. They don’t pay a penny. So if we had a minimum tax of 15% just on [inaudible 00:14:50] minimum 15, it doesn’t hurt them at all, they make a lot of money still, and we can raise a lot of money to make sure that childcare doesn’t cost you 1,400 bucks a month.'}, {'Time': 'Jimmy Kimmel: (15:04)', 'Speech': 'It all makes perfect sense. And the fact that this makes sense is why it doesn’t make sense, and why it seems so crazy, and that we have so many problems, and that maybe it’s just that Americans aren’t as knowledgeable as they should be.

Look what impact the pandemic has had on people. It has had enormous impact, negative impact. Think of just your kids, how how many of them got to go to a prom?

We’ve been hearing that phrase a lot. And we’re going to hear it some more. But before our next speaker comes out, I want to talk to you about what that really means. Day in, day out, we have a president who understands the issues and the vision of working people. And I know he is a busy man and each day he gets a big briefing book that they hand to him when he gets on the plane and he goes to his meetings and reads up on it.'}, {'Time': 'Liz Shuler: (00:49)', 'Speech': 'This president doesn’t need a briefing memo to talk to the AFL-CIO and 57 unions that represent workers. What it means to be the most pro-union president in the history of the United States means having working people kept front and center in our nation’s plans for recovery and for the future. It means having a union member as Secretary of Labor, a card carrying union member. It means having a task force at the White House dedicated to worker organizing and worker empowerment. Never done before. It means having an NLRB that’s working to ban captive audience meetings.'}, {'Time': 'Liz Shuler: (01:51)', 'Speech': 'And it means having a champion in the Oval Office who knows that working people are the engine of our economy and the heartbeat of our communities and our country. And your work, you work in getting out the vote in 2020 made all of that possible. And his commitment to our shared values made it a reality. Sisters and brothers and siblings, it is my honor, it is my privilege to introduce the most pro-union president in the history of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:44)', 'Speech': 'Hello AFL-CIO. You ain’t labor, you’re union. Makes a difference. It’s good to be home. As they say in Claymont, “Y’all brung me to the dance.” Thank you. Please, please have a seat if there is one.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:34)', 'Speech': 'You’re a gigantic reason why I’m standing here, standing here today as your president. I really mean it. I owe you. From the very beginning of my running for office back when I was a kid, it was labor unions made a difference. At the time. We were a right to work state and we changed that too. I’ve never forgotten, not only what you’ve done for me, but how importantly it meant to me and to the country, to our country, what you’ve done for the country. And I want to thank Liz for being such a good friend for so long. The first woman to lead the AFL-CIO. Born of a union household, started out as an organizer and she never stopped. Congratulations, Liz, congratulations. And congratulations to Fred Redmond, the Secretary Treasurer as well. I hope your daughter-in-law knows she’s married into a union family. Anyway, look, I know this bittersweet for all of us. This is the first convention without Rich Trumka. Rich was not only a legendary labor leader, he literally was a close friend to me and to so many of you, a true friend. Particularly there when things weren’t going well, he was always there. Above all he was an American worker. No matter how high he rose through the ranks, he never forgot where he came from.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:06)', 'Speech': 'We use that phrase all the time, never forget where you came from. He never forgot where he came from or what this work is all about. Before Rich passed, he gave me the highest compliment that I’ve ever gotten in my life, and I mean it sincerely. He called me, which your president just did, the most pro-union president history. I promised you I would be and I commit to you as long as I have this job I will remain that. Folks. Thanks you. I’ve got to tell you, nothing made me prouder than that. That’s why I made sure we put a former union president in Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:15)', 'Speech': 'Marty, he’s going to learn how to speak English, but he’s real. I kid him all the time. I’m joking. He parks his car in a car bond but he knows what he’s doing. Marty was here yesterday and he’s doing a hell of a job, but he fights like hell for us all. And just yesterday I had a conversation, a Zoom conversation with our next Senator from this state, John Fetterman.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:44)', 'Speech': 'If you’re in a foxhole, you want John with you, man. I know he can’t wait to get back on the trail and he’s looking good. And there’s no bigger, stronger voice for working people in this state than John. Certainly no bigger one for that matter. Look, we’re also joined here today by three great members of Congress who flew up with me on Air Force One, Brendan Boyle was labor, labor, labor. Donald Norcross who’s labor, labor, and Mary Gay Scanlon as well. By the way, they’ve all been there when the votes were tough, when the votes were tough to stay with you, they were there. And they’re great champions of unions. And Stacey Abrams is here as well. By the way, I’m going to ask you all a favor, help her in Georgia. Help Stacey Abrams in Georgia.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:44)', 'Speech': 'There’s three things I learned about her early on. One, she’s loyal. Two, she’s capable and three, she’s smarter than you. Me. She knows what she’s doing. So folks, please help her out. And folks, thanks to all of you coming along and we come a long way in a short time. Do you remember when our economy was like, what it looked like before we took office? 3,000 Americans are dying every day from COVID, 20 million Americans had lost their jobs on the last guy. In fact, so many Americans lost their jobs that my predecessor became just the second president in history to leave office with fewer jobs in America than when he took office. But you stepped up. The other one by the way was Herbert Hoover. And just remember, remember those long lines of cars stretching miles back waiting for just a box of food to be put back in their trunk?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:41)', 'Speech': 'Wasn’t just poor folk, it was working class folks, middle class folks. A lot of pretty nice cars in those lines. And while it was going on, America created more billionaires during that crisis in 2020 than any year in history. Talk about a contrast. Ordinary people waiting in line for an hour for a box of food and the policies in the past created more billionaires than ever in American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:13)', 'Speech': 'Folks, it’s hard to believe, but it’s true. That’s what we inherited. And then with your help, we went to work with an economic vision that looks out from Scranton, Pennsylvania, hardworking towns like it all across America, not down from Wall Street. Wall Street didn’t build this country. Middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. I’m not joking, without unions there’d be no middle class. That’s a fact. By the way, there’s a reason. You’re the best trained workers in the world. That’s not hyperbole.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:02)', 'Speech': '… workers in the world. That’s not hyperbole. When you do well, everybody does well. If investment bankers in America, they’re not all bad guys, they’re not bad, but I guess if they went on strike, not a whole hell a lot would happen. But guess what? Guess what? I tell this to my buddy, if the IBW went on strike, everything shuts down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:24)', 'Speech': 'All of you go down the road. I’m serious. No, you guys don’t understand. You don’t talk, you don’t … I don’t think you appreciate how critically important you are. I’m not trying to be nice to you. It’s just a fact. Folks, we need an economy built from the middle out and the bottom up, not to top down. Because I know when the middle class does well, everybody is. The wealthy do very well. They’re never hurt. But I also know too often, we’ve had an economy where the wealthy do better and better while the middle class gets left behind. So we went to work to change that and started with the American Rescue Plan. The law helped 41 million people put food on their table. Remember they were in trouble? Putting food on their table. We put money in the pockets of hardworking Americans who are in trouble. Being thrown out in the street because couldn’t pay the rent through no fault of their own. It gave them, what my dad used to call, just a little bit of breathing room.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:32)', 'Speech': 'The next step was the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And now not only is it infrastructure Week, we’ve arrived at infrastructure decade. And people are going to see a lot of it. We got to remind them where it’s coming from. We announced nearly $3 billion this year to improve more than 3,000 airports across 50 states. This year, this year we announced $5 billion so union workers can get to work building a national network of electric vehicle charging stations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:11)', 'Speech': 'We announced the largest investment in public transit in American history, more than the entire Amtrak system when it started, $20.5 billion. And the people we come from, like when the President Obama used to always give me the good assignments. Well, I remember one day I walked in, not a joke, and said, “Joe, fix Detroit.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:37)', 'Speech': 'I said, “Okay, no problem.” No, you think I’m kidding? You think I’m kidding? What I didn’t realize is I thought I knew a lot about the cities. When I was in Detroit, the vast majority of the people living in the cities, their jobs are out of town, because they’re not doing manufacturing in towns anymore. Out of town. So we got a rail system for them. We got freight, so we got a bus system. It changed it. It’s growing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:03)', 'Speech': 'It’s going to create more good jobs using products that are made in America. And folks, it’s also going to reduce pollution while it’s making it safer and safer for folks to go to work and get to work every day.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:16)', 'Speech': 'What all this means for all of you, it’s a simple proposition. And I remember us having this discussion, old buddy, when I think global warming, I think jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs, good paying union jobs. Jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs you can’t be outsourced.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:36)', 'Speech': 'Look, the infrastructure law is about more than rebuilding our infrastructure. It’s about rebuilding the middle class, and that’s why we made sure that the infrastructure law included significant labor protections.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:49)', 'Speech': 'For example, I insisted that overwhelming majority of the funds I included in the law are subject to Davis-Bacon requirements. Union has to do it. And it’s not just because they want to help unions. It’s simple. We’re the best in the world. If we’re going to build infrastructure, we should have, we know … What I always find we don’t talk enough about, and I’m not going to take the time today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:16)', 'Speech': 'But you know what? You don’t just decide you want to be a pipe fitter or an electrician or whatever else you want to pick. It takes you four or five years hard work. It’s like going to college. Fortunately you can have these union paid … You can get paid to do some of it. But my point is people don’t realize. And I see every place I go and you’ve heard me do it at Chambers of Commerce, the best trained workers in the world. So folks rebuilding our country will earn a prevailing wage. They should.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:50)', 'Speech': 'Another thing the law does, it’s helped expand registered apprenticeships. Remember when the business were saying, “We’ll take care of the apprenticeships.” Bless me father, for I have sinned. Come on, man. Come on. Union partnerships will allow workers to earn while they learn. That matters because laying a strong foundation for the future of this country is about more than having strong roads and bridges. It’s about making sure that here in America, folks who work hard can live their lives with dignity and respect. That’s why I continue to call on Congress to finally pass the PRO Act, which will make it easier for workers to organize.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:56)', 'Speech': 'When Franklin Roosevelt passed the NLRB, it didn’t say you can’t have unions. It said we should encourage unions. That’s the NLRB says. It’s a big difference. And look, I’m not just saying that to be pro-union. I’m saying it because I’m pro-American, folks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:26)', 'Speech': 'That’s the approach I’ve taken to build this economy. What has to be done? Well, we brought down COVID deaths by 90%. We opened schools and businesses that were shuttered. All, it all created the greatest job recovery in American history. People don’t want to talk about these days, but it’s true. Since I become president, we’ve created 8.7 million new jobs in 16 months, an all time record. And even last month, 390,000 jobs and 600,000 new manufacturing jobs. They said manufacturing is dead in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:08)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks. Our unemployment rate is near historic lows and 3.7% and millions of Americans are leaving. I love these guys talking about, “Why did this guy left my employment and went to another job because.” He got paid more. Isn’t that awful? Isn’t that a shame that they got to compete for labor. Better paying jobs for better jobs for them and their families. It’s been a long time since that’s happened in this country, but it’s happening now, and it’s working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:51)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, to your help, families are carrying less debt nationwide. They have more savings nationwide. More Americans applied for new small businesses last year than ever before in American history. 5.4 million new small business applications. Jobs and companies are coming home again. We’re making buy American a reality, not just a slogan.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:20)', 'Speech': 'I award no contracts from the federal government unless they can prove they bought it in America. And by the way, Republicans like to portray me as some kind of big spender. We have spent a lot of money, but let’s compare the facts. Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year, and all of the benefit going to the top 1% basically. Under my plan, last year we cut the by $350 billion doing all this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:01)', 'Speech': 'You know how they talk about Biden wants spend more on schools and all this. Guess what? He’s going to create a deficit. Ladies and gentlemen this year, by the end of the fiscal year, we will have cut the federal deficit by another $1.6 trillion in one year, one year. So when they come to you and talk about big spenders, let them know almost $2 trillion in deficit reduction.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:39)', 'Speech': 'I don’t want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending. We’re changing people’s lives. And because of the facts, this year we’re delivering the biggest drop in deficit in the history of the United States of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:05)', 'Speech': 'Look, the point is this, under my plan for the economy, we made extraordinary progress and we put America in a position to tackle a worldwide problem that is worse everywhere but here, inflation. It’s sapping the strength of a lot of families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:24)', 'Speech': 'I grew up in a household, not far from here, in Claymont, in Wilmington where the price of a gallon of gasoline went up, it was a conversation at dinner table. It mattered. It mattered to my working family. It mattered if the price of food went up. The problem is Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to stop my plans to bring down costs for on ordinary families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:52)', 'Speech': 'That’s why my plan is not finished and why the results aren’t finished either. Jobs are back, but prices are still too high. COVID is down, but gas prices are up. Our work isn’t done, but here’s the deal. America still has a choice to make, a choice between a government by the few, for the few, or a government for all of us. Democracy, for all of us. An economy where all of us have a fair shot and a chance to earn our place in the economy. My plan is simple. First, I’m doing everything in my power to blunt Putin’s gas price hike. Just since he invaded Ukraine, it’s gone up $1.74 a gallon because of nothing else but that. So I have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food. It’s going to take time, but let the world coordinate the largest release, what I’ve been able to do, the largest release of oil and from the global fund in history, a million barrels a day and 240 million barrels to boost global supply when I convince other nations to join us to keep prices from rising even more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:18)', 'Speech': 'And I’m working closely with our European partners to get 20 million tons of grain locked in Ukraine out onto the market to help bring down food prices. Folks, look, what Putin’s war has done is not only tried to wipe out the culture of the Ukrainians, to decimate people and commit numerable war crimes. But he’s also prevented the grain, thousands of tons of grain that are locked up in those silos ready to be exported, but they can’t get out through the Black Sea because they’d get blown out of the water.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:59)', 'Speech': 'So working on a plan to get it out through other countries by rail. But guess what? Ukraine has a system like Russia has, a rail gauge that is different than the gauge of the rest of the tracks in Europe. So we’re going to build silos, temporary silos, in the borders of Ukraine, including in Poland so we can transfer it from those cars, into those silos, into cars in Europe and get it out to the ocean and get it across the world, but it’s taking time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:38)', 'Speech': 'Second. We work to bring down gas and food prices, we can save families money in other items. We can change the dynamic of middle class families. Look, give them a little breathing room my dad said. You’ve heard me say that before. But imagine. What most middle class and working class families do is they look at that monthly bill they have on everything, the rent or the mortgage, the cost of maintaining the car, the food, everything. So if portions of that go up, one of the ways to deal with inflation damage is bring the other costs down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:17)', 'Speech': 'For example, 200,000 people Type 1 diabetes, are paying up to a thousand dollars a month for insulin. We can make sure they pay no more than $35 a month. And by the way, drug companies will still do very well. It’ll cost them 10 bucks to develop that insulin, so they’re making three and a half times their cost. My plan gives Medicare the power to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies, just like the Veterans Administration does. Bringing down the average cost of prescription drugs is a gigantic way. It really does. It affects the total amount of money you got to write out of that checkbook.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:03)', 'Speech': 'So gas is up and food is up, which we’re going to get down come hell or high water. But there’s other things we can do beyond getting the price of insulin down to $35 a month. Imagine the difference it could make. Imagine the difference it could make if in fact you had other things that I’ve been proposing. Imagine, just imagine, if you’re in a situation where you’re in a position to where pay preschool for kids that are three and four years old, increasing exponentially their possibility of going out no matter what kind of family they come from in terms of educational standing to raise a standard for people. Imagine what we could do for childcare in a city like Philadelphia and New York, the big city of Chicago. Cost you 12 to $14,000 a month for childcare. Well, there shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of your income for that. We could easily afford to do it. Look, we could do the same thing. But I really mean it. Think how that would change the families that you represent. Think how change the circumstances for working class people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:16)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, we could do the same thing with utility bills. Congress would ease the cost to families today by passing the clean energy investments I proposed. Things like tax credit for business to produce cleaner energy. Tax cuts for families that make their homes more energy efficient, which would mean a lot more jobs by the way, for some folks in this room. I met with nearly a dozen CEOs of the largest 12 utility companies in America. They said, if you pass that tax cut that, tax credit for modernizing the home, winterizing, et cetera, we will guarantee it will immediately lower the average cost of energy cost $500 a year for the average family.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:01)', 'Speech': 'That’d help a lot. In the long run it would help finally make America truly energy independent. So in the future, an American family is no longer subject to the whims of dictators halfway around the world. We’ve laid out concrete plan for families to save money, not only prescription drugs and utility bills, but on rent and mortgage costs. High speed internet. You guys out there are going to be putting on high speed and we’ve already got the money for it. Billions of dollars. Well guess what? When you get it done, it’s going to lower the cost of high speed internet for every family in America by 30 bucks a month. That’s a lot of money and it’s a lot of jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:46)', 'Speech': 'Look, we can do all this. All I’m asking is for the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans to begin to pay their fair share in taxes. I’m deadly earnest. Anybody out there think the tax system is fair, raise your hand. Look, under my plan I made this commitment in the beginning and nothing’s changed. No one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a single solitary penny more in federal taxes. Nobody.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (28:39)', 'Speech': 'But we’ll no longer have a situation where 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies made 40 billion last each year the last two years and paid zero. Zero in federal income tax on that profit, 40 billion. No, it’s a fact. I know it sounds like I making… I give you my word. It’s a fact. The fact is we’ve got about roughly 790 or so billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is for billionaires? I’m serious now. This is dead earnest. You can check it out. 8%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (29:21)', 'Speech': 'The tax rate for all of you is significantly higher. Two to three to four times higher tax rate. I say it again, 8% in federal taxes. Anybody in this room who thinks, I know you don’t think it’s fair, but we got to do something about it. And by the way, it’s not just labor, organized labor unions and Democrats who think that. The average Republican knows it’s not fair. That suburbanite mom and dad out there, they look around and know it’s not fair. I happen to believe that no billionaires should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or electrician, or a cop.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (30:00)', 'Speech': 'In our cop. Republicans have it all backwards. Their plan literally calls for increasing taxes on middle class and working people and cutting taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans. And I’m not talking about punishing anyone. Just pay your fair share. It’s a matter of decency. It’s a matter of dignity. It’s a matter of fiscal responsibility. Look, I believe in bipartisanship, but I have no illusions about this Republican party, the MAGA party. I’ve been able to bring some Republicans along on parts of my plan, but the fact is Republicans in Congress are still in the grip of the ultra MAGA agenda. They still refuse to consider changing any part of the Trump tax cuts, which delivered massive windfalls to billionaires and others. And they weren’t paid for. They still refuse to consider a minimum corporate tax, a 15% minimum tax.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:06)', 'Speech': 'They seem to think that the problem in America today is the working families aren’t paying enough. Congressional Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida, as my mother would say, God love him, he laid out a plan. I think you have it on your desks. I just took one page of that plan. This is published. It says all… This is just one of their ideas. All federal legislation sunsets in five years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress could pass it again. Now, guess what that is? Social Security. Not a joke. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. That’s not a joke. Every five years will be put on the chopping block. Every five years. And if it’s not reinstated by a vote in the Senate of a 60 or more, guess what? It automatically has got existence. That’s what they’re proposing. Unless the Congress affirmatively votes back that bring them back into existence. Think about that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (32:23)', 'Speech': 'Social security you paid for your whole life. Medicare, Medicaid. Not a joke. Really ask yourself, how are you going to sleep at night knowing that every five years Ted Cruz and the other ultra MAGA Republicans are going to vote on whether you’ll have social security, Medicare, Medicaid. It’s unlikely they’ll be able to wipe it out, but any one of you doubt for a second they’ll find ways to cut benefits and programs in order to keep anything going? That’s what this is about. They’ve always wanted to cut social security. They’ve always wanted to cut Medicare. They’ve always wanted to cut Medicaid. But if you have to start from scratch, the gentleman from Wisconsin, Senator Ron Johnson is back at it again, trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, including its protections for preexisting conditions. A hundred million people have preexisting conditions. The only reason insurance company has to cover it is because of that law. And they’re never going to stop going after it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (33:34)', 'Speech': 'So now the plan that Senator Scott’s trying to walk back, but it’s clear, the last thing they want to see is workers with power in this country. The bottom line is this. I truly believe we’ve made extraordinary progress by laying a new foundation for our economy, which becomes clear once global inflation begins to recede. There’s so much at stake, but the truth is I’ve never been more optimistic about America than I am today. I really mean it. I travel the world, trying to put things back together. You know, Trump did not leave a very good situation. You think I’m kidding? No matter where I go in the world, whether it was the Inter-American Conference we just had for this hemisphere, or NATO, or dealing with the ASEAN countries or the Far East, guess what? They look at me, and I say, “America’s back.” And they look at me and they say, “For how long?” This is America, we can do any damn thing we put our minds do. And guess what? We’re not going back to the false promises of trickle down economics. We’re going forward. We’re going forward.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (34:54)', 'Speech': 'I really mean this. I know I’m called a cockeyed optimist, but this is based on history. We’re the most unique country in the world. We’re organized on one notion. Every other country’s organized based on ethnicity, religion, geography, but the United States is based on idea. Only country in the world based on an idea. Think about it. Look to your right, look to your left. See if you and everybody all shares the same backgrounds. We’re so diverse. Why are we doing it? Because we said, “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their creator with certain in alienable rights. Life, liberty.” We’ve never met the goal, but we’ve never, other than the Trump administration, tried to walk away from that goal. And it gets better every time we push.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:56)', 'Speech': 'And unions, unions are going to play a critical role in that future. America’s always counted on union workers. Giving us half a chance you have never ever, ever, ever let the country down. We’re counting on you again to build this country for all of us, help build an economy that works for working people. And I promise you, I’m going to keep fighting for you. Are you prepared to fight with me? Well, let’s build it together. Let’s continue to give working families a fighting chance, face our challenges head on. And let’s keep building a better America because we can do it. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.'}]"

And we made a promise then that our next pride celebration would be on the south lawn of the White House. And now, here we are once again, but it was just a little too hot and humid out there to be on the lawn. So every year that we gather here in our nation’s capital is a reminder of just how far we’ve come, that we have LGBTQ leaders at some of the highest levels of government, that we can gather to celebrate all of you, that your president and I are proud to stand with you and fight beside you.'}, {'Time': 'Jill Biden: (01:15)', 'Speech': 'But we know that this progress hasn’t reached everyone in the same way. We know that in places across the country, like Florida, Texas, or Alabama, rights are under attack. And we know that, in small towns and big cities, prejudice and discrimination still lurk. It shouldn’t take courage to be yourself. It shouldn’t take courage to go to school and walk down the halls as the person you know you are. It shouldn’t take courage to hold the hand of the person you love on a bus, to kiss them goodbye on the sidewalk, to share one of the most fundamental and beautiful connections that any one of us could have in this life. It shouldn’t, but too often and in too many places, it still does.'}, {'Time': 'Jill Biden: (02:16)', 'Speech': 'And in some way, all of you here today have called on that courage and you’ve used your voice to say, we will not go back. We will not let the progress that we fought for slip away. Pride is a celebration of the courage it takes to stand up for what’s right, to become the leaders we need to live an authentic life. We recognize it as an act of bravery and beauty, of daring and defiance, and we look forward to a time when that courage is no longer needed, when all people in all places can feel the freedom and the joy that we feel here today.'}, {'Time': 'Jill Biden: (03:22)', 'Speech': 'What Joe said 10 years ago was right. Love is love. Joe and I are grateful for all of you and we will never stop working for that future. So now, I’m so proud to introduce our next speaker. I’m always impressed when young people are brave enough to come to the White House and speak in front of so many leaders, but after organizing a walkout at his high school to protest the Don’t Say Gay bill, leading a rally of his peers and publicly sharing his own story, I’m pretty sure that speaking at today’s celebration is nothing he can’t handle. Please welcome Javier Gomez. We dressed alike.'}, {'Time': 'Javier Gomez: (04:59)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Dr. Biden. I’m honored to be with you today, an educator who champions students, as well as with the President, Vice President, and Second Gentleman. My name is Javier Gomez. I use he/him pronouns and I’m honored to be here with you all today. I’m an 18-year-old proud, gay, Venezuelan American from Miami, Florida. I graduated high school last week and, next fall, I will attend the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Oh, my god. The Vice President told me it was a big deal. Oh, my god.'}, {'Time': 'Javier Gomez: (06:14)', 'Speech': 'When I was five years old, I knew I was different. I knew I liked boys, but I didn’t know the words for it. I was mocked and bullied for being too gay, too feminine or too outgoing. Those words silenced me, but I had an escape from this, my only gay fifth grade teacher. He created a classroom that made me feel welcomed. I even remember noticing his rainbow socks. It was a small, but big symbol that gave me hope.'}, {'Time': 'Javier Gomez: (06:59)', 'Speech': 'As I grew older, coming out was a rocky process, but my fifth grade teacher provided me the support I needed to understand my identity. I fear other students in Florida and across the country will not be able to get the same support because of hateful legislation, like the Don’t Say Gay Bill, but my presence here is a testament that we are fighting back because our lives are glorious, beautiful, and worthy. We deserve respect and love. And until we have that, we will fight. We will continue to fight, to fight for liberation.'}, {'Time': 'Javier Gomez: (08:00)', 'Speech': 'For months, I’ve been proud to work side by side with fellow students and allies in the community to fight back against this legislation that seeks to make schools in my state a more dangerous and hostile place to be LGBTQ+. We have traveled endless hours to Tallahassee to advocate and testify against the Don’t Say Gay bill. We organized school-wide walkouts and rallies and we looked into the eyes of those pushing this cruel and dangerous legislation and said, “It’s okay to be gay.”'}, {'Time': 'Javier Gomez: (08:47)', 'Speech': 'I’m fighting for the next little Javier, so he doesn’t have to cry himself to sleep every night, aching that he wakes up normal. To all the supportive parents, youth activists, teachers, and allies, I am proud to stand here today with you and with a true leader, a leader who is not just speaking up for us, but standing up for us with action against these extreme attacks. While the governor of my state has turned his back on young LGBTQ+ people and our families, I’m proud to stand here today with a leader who does have our back. It is my greatest honor and greatest honor to introduce the 46th President of the United States of America, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:26)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. My name is Joe Biden. I’m Joe Biden’s husband and Valerie Biden’s brother. And let me start off by saying, Javier, when you’re president and they say, “Joe Biden’s out in the waiting room,” promise me you won’t say, “Joe, who?” Thank you for that introduction, Javier, and for your incredible leadership at such a young age down in Florida. Who knows? Maybe, as I said, someday you’ll be standing here. And Jill just mentioned, along with Kamala and Doug, t’s great to see so many friends, and I mean that, friends here in Pride Month, here in the White House.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:29)', 'Speech': 'Speaker Pelosi is here. God love her. Thank you, [inaudible 00:11:39]. [inaudible 00:11:39] Chuck Schumer from New York. Senator Tammy Baldwin is here, too. Congressman Dave Cicilline is here, and the senator who took my seat in the United States Senate, a guy named Chris Coons, with other members of the equality caucus. There are too many other people to mention by name. I shouldn’t probably have started, but I want to say I acknowledge Judy and David Shepard, parents of Matthew Shepard. We spent some time together at a very difficult time, at the time. And what you’ve done and what Matthew did and what all of us are … I mean, look what’s happened, in no small part because of you. I mean that sincerely. It’s good to see you both again. It really is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:49)', 'Speech': 'By the way, it’s almost exactly seven years since the Supreme Court affirmed marriage equality in America. And Jim, you called me on the steps of the Supreme Court after that. Where’s Jim? There you go. You called me. I got this phone call when the court decision came down. And Jim was standing on … I think you were on the steps of the Supreme Court when you called me and said, “Well, we did it, we did it, we did it.” The victor is not just for you and John, but for the whole country, the whole country.” Jim, it’s good to see you, pal. It really is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:25)', 'Speech': 'And as a point of personal privilege, I want to acknowledge Sarah McBride. Sarah, where are you? Sarah used to work for our deceased son, Beau, in Attorney General’s Office in Delaware. She’s the first transgender state senator in history and, when I served as Vice President, served as an intern in the White House, as well. That’s why I kept my office going [inaudible 00:13:57]. As I said, she also worked for our beloved son, Beau, the Attorney General, and they passed … Anyway, they did a lot. They did a lot together. Sarah, wonderful to see you, kiddo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:11)', 'Speech': 'Look, last year, we hosted this event. The message is simple. Pride is back at the White House. From day one, this has been the most pro-equality administration in history, led by guys like Pete Buttigieg and so many others. I think we have more LGBTQ+ people than any administration or every administration combined. No, I really mean it. I really mean it because I promised when I got elected I wanted my administration to look like America, look like America across the board. And we’ve done that, record number of out and proud appointees at every single level of our government. And as I said, Secretary Buttigieg, who needs no introduction, is doing an outstanding job of rebuilding America. And I mean that in a literal sense and not just in terms of what he’s doing in transportation, but he’s helping rebuild pride in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:22)', 'Speech': 'And my public spokesman, Karine Jean-Pierre, is making history [inaudible 00:15:34]. We’re also joined by the Assistant Secretary of Health and Education and Human Services, Admiral Rachel Levine, and under Secretary of Defense, Sean Steele. Where is he?

Thank you very much, the first and second transgender Americans to be senate-confirmed in American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:11)', 'Speech': 'Let me say, as Commander in Chief, I’m proud to have ended the un-American ban on transgender Americans serving in our military. And just last week, the Department of Defense announced new policies allowing HIV-positive service members to finally be able to deploy and commission. I’m also proud to have signed at executive order on my first day in office to combat discrimination against LGBTQLI, excuse me, plus Americans in housing, in healthcare, in education, in employment, financial service and the criminal justice system. First thing I signed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:03)', 'Speech': 'No one knows better than the people in this room, we have a lot more work to do, a lot more work to do. I don’t have to tell you about the ultra MAGA agenda attacking families and our freedoms. 300 discriminatory bills introduced in the states across this country. In Texas, knocking on front doors to harass and investigate parents who are raising transgender children. In Florida, going after Mickey Mouse, for God’s sake. That struck close to home. No, but think about this. All of you in this room know better than anyone that these attacks are real and consequential for real families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:44)', 'Speech': 'Just look at what happened in Idaho last weekend. 31 white supremacists stopped just before they reached the pride celebration where they apparently planned to unleash violence on people gathering peacefully in a show of their pride. I’m grateful for the swift response of law enforcement and they responded. They responded. Violent attacks on community, including ongoing attacks on transgender women of color, make our nation less safe because the attacks are more than ever last year and they’re on pace again this year. They’re disgusting and they have to stop.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:20)', 'Speech': 'Right now, there are young people sitting in their bedroom, doors closed, silent, scrolling through social media, staring at the ceiling, wondering if they’ll ever be loved, ever marry, ever have a family, be accepted by their own family sometimes. Our son started an organization before he died to make sure that people understood what it meant, going all around the country, letting people know, trying to train families, the mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, of LGBTQ+ people that they have to reach out, embrace and love their blood, to allow them to be themselves, or whether they should even be here on earth, a lot of folks wonder.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:08)', 'Speech': 'I found my friends, some of my gay friends, I’ve asked them, “What was it like as a kid?” I can’t imagine what it’s like, locking yourself in that room and wondering, just staring at the ceiling, just wondering. And I would note parenthetically that we owe an awful lot to those early, early folks who had the courage to stand up. No, I really mean it. The message then was not only could you be physically beaten, but you’d lose your job. We owe so many people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:54)', 'Speech': 'My message to all the young people, just be you. You loved, you are heard, you are understood, you do belong. And I want you to know that, as your president, all of us on this stage have your back. We have your back. Receive who you are [inaudible 00:20:25] of God and deserving dignity, respect, and support. Today, I’m about to sign an executive order that directs key federal agencies to protect our communities from those hateful attacks and advance equality for families. My order will use the full force of the federal government to prevent inhumane practices of conversion therapy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:46)', 'Speech': 'This is the first time the federal government is leading a coordinated response against this dangerous, discredited practice. The executive order will also support mental health for children by addressing bullying and suicide and making our schools safer. Addressing the nation’s mental health crisis is a key pillar of the unity agenda I announced in the State of the Union address.

And we’ll do so on the shoulders of so many people who are no longer with us, but who paved the way for us, people like Gloria Allen, known as Mama Gloria, who transitioned in 1950s and who passed away just two days ago, people like the legendary advocate, Mr. Vad.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:44)', 'Speech': 'You know what I mean?

https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-remarks-on-the-supreme-court-decision-6-24-22-transcript,2022-06-26,President Biden Delivers Remarks on the Supreme Court Decision 6/24/22 Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:00)', 'Speech': 'Today is a, it’s not hyperbole. It suggests a very solemn moment today. The Supreme Court of the United States expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people that it had already recognized. They didn’t limit it. They simply took it away, and it’s never been done to a right so important to so many Americans, but they did it. It’s a sad day for the court and for the country. 50 years ago, Roe V. Wade was decided and has been the law of the land since then. This landmark case protected women’s right to choose, her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from the interference of politics. It reaffirmed basic principles of equality, that women have the power to control their own destiny, and it reinforced a fundamental right of privacy, the right of each of us to choose how to live our lives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:07)', 'Speech': 'Now with Roe gone, let’s be very clear. The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk. As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as Vice President, now as President of the United States, I’ve studied this case carefully. I’ve overseen more Supreme Court confirmations than anyone today, where this case was always discussed. I believe Roe V. Wade was the correct decision, as a matter of constitutional law and application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy. It was a decision on a complex matter that drew a careful balance between a woman’s right to choose earlier in her pregnancy and the state’s ability to regulate later in her pregnancy, a decision with broad national consensus, that most Americans of faith and backgrounds found acceptable, that have been the law of the land for most of the lifetime of Americans today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:17)', 'Speech': 'It was a constitutional principle upheld by justices appointed by Democrat and Republican Presidents alike. Roe V. Wade was a seven to two decision, written by justice appointed by a Republican President, Richard Nixon. In the five decades that followed Roe V. Wade, justices appointed by Republican Presidents from Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, George W. Bush were among the justices who voted to uphold the principles set forth in Roe V. Wade. It was three justices named by one President, Donald Trump, who are the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake. This decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset balance of our law. It’s a realization of an extreme ideology in a tragic error by the Supreme Court, in my view.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:23)', 'Speech': 'The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right, that is so fundamental to so many Americans, that had already been recognized. The court’s decision to do so will have real and immediate consequences. State laws banning abortion are automatically taking effect today, jeopardizing the health of millions of women, some without exceptions, so extreme that women can be punished for protecting their health, so extreme that women and girls were forced to bear their rapist’s child, or the child of consequence. It just stunt me. So extreme that doctors will be criminalized for fulfilling their duty to care. Imagine having a young women having to carry a child of incest, as a consequence of incest. No option. Too often the case. The poor women are going to be hit the hardest. It’s cruel.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:40)', 'Speech': 'In fact, the court laid out state laws, criminalized abortion that go back to the 1800s as rationale. The court literally, taking America back 150 years. This is a sad day for the country in my view, but it doesn’t mean the fight’s over. Let me be very clear and unambiguous. The only way we can secure women’s right to choose, and the balance that existed, is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe V. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the President can do that. If Congress, as it appears, lacks the vote to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard. This fall, you must elect more Senators and Representatives who will codify a women’s right to choose into federal law once again, elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level. We need to restore the protections of Roe as law of the land.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:51)', 'Speech': 'We need to elect officials who will do that. This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality, they’re all on the ballot. Until then, I will do all in my power to protect a woman’s right in states where they will face the consequences of today’s decision. While the Court’s decision casts a dark shadow over a large swath of the land, many states in this country still recognize a woman’s right to choose. So, if a woman lives in a state that restricts abortion, the Supreme Court’s decision does not prevent her from traveling from her home state to the state that allows. It does not prevent a doctor in that state from treating her.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:47)', 'Speech': 'As the Attorney General has made clear, women must remain free to travel safely to another state to seek care they need. My administration will defend that bedrock right. If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack. My administration will also protect a woman’s access to medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, like contraception, which is essential for preventative healthcare, Mifepristone, which the FDA approved 20 years ago to safely end early pregnancies, and is commonly used to treat miscarriages.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:38)', 'Speech': 'Some states are saying that they’ll try to ban or severely restrict access to these medications, but extremist governors and state legislators are looking to block the mail or search the person’s medicine cabinet or control the woman’s actions by tracking data on her apps she uses, are wrong and extreme and out of touch with the majority of Americans. The American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote to me and Vice President Harris stressing that these laws are not based on evidence, and asking us to act to protect access to care. They say, by limiting access to these medicines, maternal mortality will climb in America. That’s what they say.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:29)', 'Speech': 'Today, I’m directing the Department of health and Human Services to take steps to ensure these critical medications are available to the fullest extent possible, and the politicians cannot interfere in the decisions that should be made between a woman and her doctor. My administration will remain vigilant as the implications of this decision play out. I’ve warned about how this decision risked the broader right to privacy for everyone. That’s because Roe recognized the fundamental right to privacy that has served as a basis for so many more rights that we’ve come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this country, the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control, a married couple in the privacy of their bedroom for God’s sake, the right to marry the person you love. Now, Justice Thomas said as much today. He explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality, the right of couples to make their choices on contraception.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:45)', 'Speech': 'This is extreme and dangerous path the Court’s now taking us on. Let me close with two points. First, I call on everyone, no matter how deeply they care about this decision to keep all protests, peaceful, peaceful, peaceful, peaceful. No intimidation. Violence is never acceptable. Threats and intimidation are not speech. We must stand against violence in any form, regardless of your rationale. Second, I know so many of us are frustrated and disillusioned that the Court has taken something away that’s so fundamental. I know so many women are now going to face incredibly difficult situations. I hear you. I support you. I stand with you. The consequences and the consensus of the American people, core principles of equality, liberty, dignity, and the stability of the rule of law demand that Roe should not have been overturned.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': 'With this decision, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court shows how extreme it is, how far removed they are from the majority of this country. They’ve made the United States an outlier among developed nations in the world. But this decision must not be the final word. My administration will use all of its appropriate lawful powers, but Congress must act. With your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over. Thank you very much. I’ll have more to say this in weeks to come.'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (11:43)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, [inaudible 00:11:50]'}]"

Earlier this year, we surged 20,000 additional US forces to Europe, to bolster our Alliance in response to Russia’s aggressive move, bringing our force total in Europe to 100,000. We’re going to continue to adjust our posture based on the threat, in close consultation with our allies.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:30)', 'Speech': 'Here in Spain, we’re going to work with our ally to increase US Navy Destroyer Station in Spain’s Rota Naval Base, from four to six destroyers. In Poland, we’re going to establish a permanent headquarters, the US 5th Army Corps, and strengthening our US NATO interoperability across the entire Eastern flank.

Thanks for doing this. Thanks. Leave it to you? I open it up, okay.'}, {'Time': 'Jennifer Klein: (00:11)', 'Speech': 'You open it up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:13)', 'Speech': 'I know you’re all busy as I am. Thank you for making the time, but I need not tell any of you we’re in a really an important area here and we have to act. I’m joined by a group of Democratic governors. We work closely to protect women’s rights after this tragic reversal of Roe v. Wade, a terrible extreme decision in my view, upending lives and impacting on the health and safety of millions of women. And I share the public outrage at this extremist court that’s committed to moving America backwards with fewer rights, less autonomy, and politicians invading the most personal decisions that not only women, but we’ll find if they expand on this decision men as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:01)', 'Speech': 'But as I’ve said last week, this is not over. Last week I announced two specific actions. First, if extremist governors try to block a woman from traveling from her state that prohibits her from seeking medical help she needs to a state that provides that care, the federal government will act to protect her bedrock rights through the Attorney General’s Office. Second, if states try to block a woman from getting medication the FDA has already approved and has been available for more than 20 years, my administration will act to protect that woman’s right to that medication.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:38)', 'Speech': 'And there are many other unlawful actions in my view that states are preparing to take that we’ll have to address as well. But ultimately, Congress is going to have to act to codify Roe into federal law. As I said yesterday, the filibuster should not stand in the way of us being able to do that, but right now we don’t have the votes in the Senate to change the filibuster at the moment. That means we need two more votes now, not now, when we vote, probably after November, more Senators and the House majority elected November to get this bill to my desk.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:17)', 'Speech': 'So the choice is clear. We either elect federal Senators and Representatives who will codify Roe, or Republicans who will elect the House and Senate who will try to ban abortions nationwide. Nationwide. This is going to go one way or the other after November. So let’s remember, the reasoning of this decision has an impact much beyond Roe and to the right to privacy more generally. Justice Thomas himself said that under the reasoning of this decision, that the court should reconsider marriage equality and contraception.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:55)', 'Speech': 'And there’s a lot at stake here. In the meantime, I want to hear what the Governors are doing. Talk about my plans and discuss what we can do until Congress acts. This is not over. It’s not over. Now I’m going to turn it over to Jen Klein, the head of the White House Gender Policy Council, and we’ll proceed with the discussions. Jen?'}, {'Time': 'Jennifer Klein: (03:16)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I’d like to add my thanks to each of you for joining, and for your leadership. We’d, as the President just said, really like to hear from you about both what you’ve done and further action that you’re planning to take. So we’re going to start with you, Governor Hochul from New York. Over to you.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (03:36)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Jen. And thank you, Mr. President for convening us with the sense of urgency that I feel that you are conveying because this is a frightening time for women all across our nation. Lot of fear and anxiety out there, and I hear it from women all across the state. They come up to me at subway stops in New York City, at farmers markets. Literally young women who never even had to think about this right are coming up and putting their arms around my neck and sobbing. So there is such stress out there.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (04:04)', 'Speech': 'So in the state of New York, this came the day after the Supreme Court also told us that we did not have the right to protect our citizens from people carrying concealed weapons in places like subways, and Times Square, et cetera. So what I had to do is convene an extraordinary session because they weren’t due back until January. I brought them back, and literally at 2:00 A.M. this morning while we’re still working on the gun legislation I changed my proclamation to say we’ll also include to give further protections for women in the state, what we call the equality agenda.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (04:38)', 'Speech': 'This will prohibit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare, and autonomy. So we’re one step closer as of this afternoon, I think it’s going to be passed by both Houses to enshrine abortion rights in our State Constitution. So as long as I’m Governor, these rights will not be rolled back, but we also are prepared to serve as a destination for women who’ll be looking to a place like New York and other states of my colleagues on the call as a safe harbor.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (05:08)', 'Speech': 'So even before the Supreme Court decision, I knew I had to beef up our opportunities for women to come from other states. We allocated $35 million right off the bat to go to providers so they could hire more people, expand their space, and make sure that they can keep their staff safe from violence as well. And we also decided to mandate all insurance companies doing business in the state of New York now have to cover abortion. And I signed six bills related to protecting our providers after the decision came down.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (05:41)', 'Speech': 'We will stop the extradition of any search for one of our providers or a woman who’s in our state who are wanted under criminal charges, that’s not happening in New York. And we’re also defending our abortion providers from malpractice and other lawsuits. We also launched a public awareness campaign because there’s a lot of misinformation. Women in New York are seeing the national news, they don’t know whether their rights are protected here in New York. So we’re going to continue to be leaders in this fight. Protect our providers, protect them from the vigilante justice which has been unleashed by the states that are going to allow these private rights of action, where they’re going to hunt down women and providers.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (06:21)', 'Speech': 'This is chaos, it’s frightening, but also we’re doing what we can to make sure that we are protected. But what’s happening now, the rights of millions of women across this country are now falling on the shoulders of just a handful of states. Just a handful of states are now going to have to take care of the healthcare of women from other states. So we believe as you do Mr. President, that what’s available to New Yorkers and the other enlightened states should be available to all Americans. And no one should have to travel.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (06:51)', 'Speech': 'And that’s why, as you agree with us, Congress has to act. And we sent a letter way back to Congress saying, “Please pass the Women’s Health Protection Act. Let’s get it through the Senate.” So what we’re doing at the state level is key. But I completely agree with you and I commend you, Mr. President, for standing up and talking about the fact that it is the filibuster that’s preventing the majority of Senators, and it is the majority of Senators, who want to speak on behalf of the majority of Americans.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (07:21)', 'Speech': 'But we understand our options are limited until next January with a new Senate, and we’re all going to be focusing very hard on that outcome because it is a matter of life and death for American women. Because we do not want to go back to the days anywhere in this country of the back alley abortions, which are real. I talked to one of my neighbors down the hall whose husband used to perform these abortions before abortion was legal in New York State in 1970.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (07:48)', 'Speech': 'And so this is not just hyperbole, it is real. So what we’re asking to help continue at the federal level, we believe that more can be done to fund family planning services more broadly to allow the providers and their clinics to have federal resources for these services and they can focus on private dollars for abortion services. And I’m really grateful that you’re putting an emphasis on what’s going happen for women to be able to continue to receive abortion services by mail. I mean, this is going to be a battle that people would not have foreseen. We want to make sure that there’s no unlawful interference, and we have to do that to ease public concerns.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (08:27)', 'Speech': 'And also Mr. President, we’d ask that you consider your ability to use federal facilities. What am I talking about? Veterans hospitals, military bases, and other places where the federal government controls the jurisdiction in some of the states that are hostile to women’s rights and make sure that those services can be available to other women. So those are just a few of the ideas that we encourage you to look at, an idea of what we’re doing at the New York State level. But literally before close of business today, we will have the first step toward a process of changing our Constitution, which is the boldest step we can take. And we just started that today.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (09:02)', 'Speech': 'So thank you for convening us. We are there to stand with you to do something that… Protect a right that my mother’s generation had to fight for, I fought for, my daughter, who’s in her 30’s, had to fight for. And now, Mr. President, I have a brand new granddaughter, and thank you for your note acknowledging that. I didn’t think we’d have to fight this battle for her generation as well, but apparently we do. But we are ready to take on that fight, so thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:27)', 'Speech': 'Well, I didn’t think we would either. I was worried we would, but I think that a lot of the folks don’t understand what this decision means. It means if you got a 11 year old child who’s a victim of incest and finds herself pregnant, which occurs, that she can’t get choice. Her health can’t be protected. You find if you’re raped, there’s no exception. I mean, there’s so many things that people really haven’t focused on yet beyond the fundamental right of a woman to be able to choose.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:02)', 'Speech': 'And so I just think that as you pointed out, Kathy, it’s just going to be a big deal that we get people out to vote. Because here’s what’s going to happen, I predict. If we don’t keep the Senate, increase it in the House, we’re going to be in a situation where the Republicans are going to pass a nationwide prohibition consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled. And so there’s a lot at stake here, but I’m sure glad you’re leading New York. For real.'}, {'Time': 'Kathy Hochul: (10:35)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:36)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Jennifer Klein: (10:36)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Governor Hochul. I’m now going to turn to Governor Cooper.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (10:41)', 'Speech': 'Thanks, Jen. Thanks Mr. President for convening this call and for your leadership, particularly on the filibuster. And unlike Governor Hochul in New York, our Republican legislature is not going to amend the constitution, but this Democratic Governor is going to hold the line to protect women’s reproductive freedom in our state. It has really been devastating for so many as reproductive care really has been halted in its tracks in many places across the country. That constitutional right that women have relied on for five decades has been ripped away.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (11:20)', 'Speech': 'And for now at least, where you live will determine your rights. So for now it’s up to the states to determine whether women can get reproductive healthcare. And in North Carolina, they still can. And I’m determined to keep it that way. Because of our location in the Southeast, Mr. President, North Carolina’s already seeing an influx of patients coming to our state for safe care. According to Planned Parenthood of the South Atlantic, their clinics in North Carolina have scheduled 192 patients from out of state for the next week alone. That means about 10,000 extra patients from out of state coming to North Carolina in the next year, mostly from states that have bans and tighter restrictions.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (12:13)', 'Speech': 'And those, Mr. President, are just the numbers from Planned Parenthood, that doesn’t include our state’s other trusted providers. So we know those numbers will be a lot higher. Your zip code should not determine your rights. North Carolina has a law that’s gonna prevent obstructing access to these clinics, and we’re working with law enforcement to make sure that law is enforced. Women and doctors should not have these politicians in the exam room with them looking over their shoulders. And I’m going to continue to trust women to make their own medical decisions.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (12:51)', 'Speech': 'Now a large part of that, at least for North Carolina, Mr. President, is keeping enough Democratic state legislators in our state to sustain my vetos as they have a time and again before. And it also means keeping and electing more Democratic Governors across the country this November. And that is my mission as Chair of the Democratic Governors Association this year. Because Mr. President, right now Governors really are the last line of defense, and they’re also the first chance at progress, which you’re going to hear today. Especially with this Supreme Court on such a destructive path.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (13:31)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President the stakes are high, but they have never been clearer. We are not, we are not backing down. We are ready to do what is needed to protect women’s health. And Mr. President, I urge you to do everything you can on the federal level while we work hard in the states. Thanks. Thanks for this opportunity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:54)', 'Speech': 'Well look, Roy, you’re doing a heck of a job, and a lot of your colleagues on this call are as well. I got off the phone today with the Attorney General before I… As a matter of fact, that’s one of the reasons I was, excuse me, a few minutes late. And we’re going to do everything within the power of the federal government to make sure that any attempt to obstruct anything from travel to access to medicine does not occur. We also, by the way, I think we’re going to have to see, and this relate to Governor Hochul as well, that funding for family planning, not for abortion but for family planning…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:36)', 'Speech': 'And there’s a lot we have to do because a lot of women… For example, a lot of the family planning has to do with whether or not a woman gets access, poor women get access to cancer care or things unrelated to choice. And so there’s a lot we have to do. I think we can get it done. I think the American people are with us. And again, I thank you for your leadership. And I’m not being solicitous, but you’re always there. So thanks, pal. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Roy Cooper: (15:07)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Grateful for you.'}, {'Time': 'Jennifer Klein: (15:10)', 'Speech': 'And now we’re going to turn to Governor Lujan Grisham.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (15:14)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Jen. And thank you Mr. President, and I’m delighted frankly to join the fight with my incredible Democratic Gubernatorial colleagues. That we are in fact that brick wall against this horrific Supreme Court decision. I also, Mr. President, really appreciate that you’ve continued to lean in, that this privacy right debate extends far beyond choice. And what we do today in the space for protecting reproductive rights absolutely should move in the direction to prepare to protect everyone’s additional privacy rights, including making sure that we don’t roll backwards on same sex marriage and other related issues.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (16:08)', 'Speech': 'So New Mexico certainly saw this coming as a potential. A year ago, I signed into a law repealing an antiquated unconstitutional law that could criminalize abortion care and abortion providers. That is now repealed, we did that last year. And in doing that, we also increased resources for family planning, contraceptives, reproductive care, abortion, abortion care services through all of our network of providers and through state funds. We’ll continue to do that.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (16:48)', 'Speech': 'Most recently, we signed an Executive Order following the same kinds of efforts you’re seeing now across the country. Joining Massachusetts as an example, but now New York, this is not a place where the draconian efforts by neighboring states, such as Texas, who have stated that they will in fact criminalize providers. They’re looking for providers that have multiple-state operations and licenses. And this whole notion that you can criminalize the patient, including asking your neighbors and churches to turn your loved ones, family members, and neighbors in.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (17:29)', 'Speech': 'We will not cooperate as a state in any of those efforts or investigations. We will not extradite. We will provide coverage and protection for all of our providers and any individual seeking abortion care and abortion services in the state of New Mexico. Like my colleagues, we are seeing an increase and we are working diligently to make sure that when we say and we mean that abortion is legal, safe, and accessible that in fact it is.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (18:01)', 'Speech': 'So as you talk about what we can do given this Supreme Court decision, and given that my colleague like Chairman Governor Roy Cooper, not every state has a Democratically led legislature. We are going to need the feds to think about ways, not just the FDA protection for making sure that telemedicine is available for contraceptives and abortion care, but in fact we are going to need to make sure that through a public health vehicle that we are in fact doing family planning. We should educate people, that should be a national campaign.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (18:39)', 'Speech': 'We should talk about access points. We should be using school-based health centers. There’s a number of things that we could use your assistance and your leadership. And you’re already leaning in that direction, not just on preventing the criminalization but making sure we’re talking about where resources can in fact go that would protect women in states that have signaled that they have no interest in their wholesale bans in protecting women and other populations and keeping government out of their personal autonomous decision making, too.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (19:13)', 'Speech': 'I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Hochul that there are more federal opportunities. And she mentioned several. I think that our Indian health service clinics could be another effective vehicle. I will tell you that I’ve been reached out by a number of sovereign nations who I think would be very supportive and interested. Certainly can’t speak to that across the country, but they’re clear that even a new recent Supreme Court decision limiting sovereignty has the same draconian absolute right unfairness that is looking at being applied through the Supreme Court to them.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Grisham: (19:54)', 'Speech': 'So I think that may be yet another vehicle that we could expand that would protect women, and particularly minority populations, all across the country. We stand ready to fight hard across the country in making sure that you have what you need in Congress so that we can codify Roe v. Wade. So that your states that stand as that safe haven and brick wall will continue to do that. And support as many women and their families all across America who are going to need us as we fight to win this battle.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:33)', 'Speech': 'Well, Michelle, you’re already standing up for folks on your neighboring states. It matters, it matters a lot. And one of the things that I’m finding is that we are looking, beginning the process, or in the process of looking at all the alternatives, including the sovereign nation question. But there’s gonna be a lot more that’s going to come through. I mean, I think people are going to be shocked when the first state that tries to arrest a woman for crossing a state line to get health services. And I don’t think people believe that’s going to happen, but it’s going to happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:18)', 'Speech': 'And it’s going to telegraph to the whole country that this is a gigantic deal that goes beyond… I mean, it affects all your basic rights. So anyway, I thank you for all you’re already doing. And we’re going to take a quick little hesitation here. The press is about to leave so we can continue. If you all have a few more minutes, I want to talk to all of you if you can. And while we’re waiting, think about what you think I should be doing if you’re sitting in my seat. That I should be considering that we haven’t already considered, and it’d be useful.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 7: (22:02)', 'Speech': 'One second, sir.'}]"

Mighty one, oh, ancient of days. You have commanded us to be strong and courageous in life or in death because you are always with us. Receive your servant’s most humble prayer as we gather today to remember, honor, and celebrate four selfless exemplars of unquestioned strong and courageous valor. Staff Sergeant Edward Kaneshiro, Specialist Dwight Birdwell, Specialist Dennis Fujii, and Major John Duffy’s strong and courageous actions in Vietnam inspire us all. Each of these men distinguished himself at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty.

The care of a combat medic to preserve life and the character of a special forces warrior to free the oppressed. When our nation asked who will go? Each of these men declared, “Here, am I. Send me.” Today, a grateful nation bestows its highest honor to these men of valor who look not only to their own needs, but to the needs of others in time of extreme crisis. Almighty God, be present with us during this ceremony as we recognize the intrepid service of these heroes. Richly bless the recipients we honor today along with the many family members, comrades in arms, and dear friends who support them. May the actions of these men in the crucible of combat inspire others to acts of personal courage and selfless service. Guide our nation and leaders. Preserve us all into the canopy of your everlasting love and care. It is in your majestic and mighty name I pray. Amen.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:16)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, general. Please be seated. Please be seated.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:23)', 'Speech': 'Well, welcome to the White House. This is a day that I quite frankly think being president is inadequate because there’s so many brave women and men in here, and so many people we are honoring today. Mr. Secretary, chairman of the joint chiefs, senior military officers. Thank you all for being here. Yesterday marked the 246th anniversary of this nation’s independence. 246 years of struggle and sacrifice to uphold the principles so dear to the character of our nation. Liberty, democracy, God given rights of every individual. It’s a journey that has never finished and it never will be fully finished. It’s a work that requires us to look ahead to the future, the future we want to build and to look carefully at our past. To understand fully where we’ve come from.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:28)', 'Speech': 'For each of those 246 years, American patriots have answers our nation’s call to military service. They stood in the way of danger, risked everything, literally everything to defend our nation and our values. However, not every service member has received the full recognition they deserve. Today, we’re setting the record straight. We’re upgrading the awards of four soldiers who performed acts of incredible heroism during the Vietnam conflict to respect the conspicuous gallantry and intrepid ability of their service. I mean, it’s just astounding when you hear what each of them have done. They went far above and beyond the call of duty. It’s a phrase always used, but it takes on life when you see these men.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:21)', 'Speech': 'To the late staff sergeant, Edward M. Kaneshiro, Specialist 5 Dwight W. Birdwell, to Specialist 5 Dennis M. Fujii, and to Major John Duffy, I’m proud to finally award our highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor to each of you, one posthumously. It has been a long journey to this day for those heroes and their families. And for more than 50 years have passed, 50 years since the jungles of Vietnam where as young met these soldiers first prove their medal, but time has not diminished their astonishing bravery, their selfness in putting the lives of others ahead of their own, and the gratitude that we as the nation owe them.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:08)', 'Speech': 'December 1, 1966, Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro was an infantry squad leader. His platoon was navigating toward what seemed to be a peaceful village. It was an ambush, a vastly superior force of north Vietnamese troops was concealed within the village protected by fortified bunkers, underground tunnels, and a big trench that ran through the entire village. As Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro led his squad to the east of the village, two other squads headed straight in where the enemy opened fire on them with machine guns and small arms fire, killing the platoon leader, the point man, and pinning down two squads.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:49)', 'Speech': 'Hearing the battle unfold, Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro moved his squad toward the sound of the firing, where he quickly jumped into action. The machine gun fire suppressing his platoon mates was coming from a big trench. It had to be stopped. He ordered his men to take cover. And then he advanced alone toward the enemy position. Armed with six grenades in his M16, lying flat on the ground, Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro hurled his first grenade. It sailed directly through the aperture of the bunker, taking out the machine gunner in the first throw. He then jumped into the trench alone, moving along the trench for 35 meters, clearing the enemy as he went, as his head would emerge above the trench as he yelled, “Grenade.” Then his platoon would lose sight of him and hear it explode.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:45)', 'Speech': 'By the time he was done, the two other squads were able to stand up, collect their dead and injured and reorganize the fight and successfully withdraw from the village. According to the eyewitnesses account of the battle from Staff Sergeant Hasket, Kaneshiro’s bravery and singlehandedly clearing the trench averted what might have been “a disaster for the whole platoon.”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:10)', 'Speech': 'Born and raised in Hawaii, the son of Japanese immigrants, a proud husband and father of four, Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro continued his service with his unit in Vietnam until he was killed in action by hostile gunfire in March 6th, 1967. Today, his memory lives on in the lives he saved, in the legend of his fearlessness, and the hearts of the family he left behind. John, Naomi, Tom, thank you for being here today and thank you to, for your sister, Doris as well, who could not be with us. And John, thank you for your military service. Your family sacrificed so much for our country. I know that no award can ever make up for the loss of your father for not having him there as you grew up. But I hope today that you take some pride and comfort in knowing his valor is finally receiving the full recognition it has always deserved.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:10)', 'Speech': 'January 31, 1968. It was an opening assault that would come to be known as the Tet offensive, particularly bloody period of the Vietnam War. North Vietnamese forces launched an attack on a strategically located airbase near Saigon. The first American unit call to respond was that of Specialist 5 Dwight Birdwell. Unknown to approximately 100 men in sea troop, they were moving to be taken on a full regimen of [inaudible 00:08:44] likely be more than 1,000 strong. They arrived. The troop engaged the [inaudible 00:08:51] forces. Specialist Birdwell’s unit took the main brunt of the attack with many tanks and vehicles disabled.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:57)', 'Speech': 'When his tank commander was hit and gravely wound, Specialist Birdwell got him to a place of safety and then took command. He knew his vehicle was on the first line of defense. So Birdwell stood in his commander’s hatch at times, half exposed. At times, standing entirely out of the tank, fully exposed, laying down suppressive fire on the enemy. He used the tank’s cannon. He used the tank’s machine gun. He used his personal rifle. He sustained fire, drove back the attackers, and created a place of relative safety for injured men behind the tank to take cover. He provided battlefield updates to his commanders until the enemy shot the communication system right off of his helmet.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:45)', 'Speech': 'When he ran out of ammunition, he ran to retrieve an M60 machine gun and ammo off the helicopter that had been downed in a flight to keep firing on the enemy. And even when that M60 was hit by enemy fire causing it explode and send shrapnel into Birdwell’s face, chest, arms, and hands, he remained on the battlefield. When he was ordered to load onto the medevac helicopter, he complied. This I find amazing, only to crawl right back off the other side, and to keep on fighting. That’s your call taking orders and causing trouble. God love you. Only after reinforcement arrived and only after he helped treat the evacuates, his fellow wounded, did Specialist Birdwell agree to evacuate himself. At the time, Birdwell received a Silver Star for his outstanding heroism on the battlefield. It took decades for his commanding officer, then General Glen Otis to realize Birdwell had not received the full honor he had earned. But in retirement, General Otis made sure to correct the record and fully document Birdwell’s actions to make this day possible. A member of the Cherokee Nation, Birdwell credits the Cherokee-'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': 'A member of the Cherokee nation, Birdwell credits the Cherokee veterans who came before him, and encouraged him to serve when called. I might note, Native American communities, a larger percentage serve in the United States Armed Forces, at a higher percentage rate than any other cohort in America. After leaving the army, Birdwell continued to build a legacy of service in his community in Oklahoma. He started his own law firm, served for 12 years on the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court, and he passed that legacy of service down to his daughter, Stephanie Birdwell, who’s with him today, and who serves as the director of the Office of Tribal Relations at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Specialist Five Birdwell, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And, to your wife, Virginia, who I know wishes could be here with you today, give her our love as well. I’m grateful for all that you’ve given to our country, and that at long last, your story’s being honored, as it should have been always.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:06)', 'Speech': 'February 18th, 1971, Specialist Five Dennis Fuji, who was serving a second tour in Vietnam as a crew chief on a helicopter ambulance, conducting a rescue operation in Laos. They were there to evacuate wounded, allied Vietnamese military personnel, but as their chopper attempted the land, it became the target, sustaining heavy damage that caused them to crash land in the middle of the conflict. When a second American helicopter managed the land nearby minutes later, he was able to evacuate all the downed crewmen except specialist Fuji. Rather than risk the lives of his crew mates, Specialist Fuji waved off the helicopter, told him to depart, remaining behind as the only American on the battlefield. Several attempts were made to rescue him before Specialist Fuji could find a radio and call off further attempts. It was too dangerous, he said.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:03)', 'Speech': 'He stayed behind, ignoring his own wounds, while helping tend to wounded Vietnamese allies on the field. The next night, the enemy force renewed their assault on the allied lines, with heavy artillery. For more than 17 consecutive hours, Specialist Fuji called in American gunships to help repel the attack. He repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire in order to better observe enemy positions, and direct air strikes against them. On the radio, as fellow Americans knew him as Papa Whiskey, a clear eyed, levelheaded soldier, directing airstrikes so precisely they were able to drive back the forces that had come within 15 to 20 meters of a friendly camp. When an American helicopter was finally able to retrieve him, wounded and severely fatigued two days after his air ambulance had crashed, he made it only about four kilometers before it crash landed.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:02)', 'Speech': 'Specialist Fuji had to wait two more days, for another South Vietnamese base, before he was able to leave the area, and receive medical assistance for his wounds. Speaking to the press shortly after his experience, Specialist Fuji downplayed his own contributions, and honored the skills of the allied Vietnamese troops he fought with, simply saying, “I like my job. I like to help other people who need help out there.” It’s amazing. Today, Specialist Five Fuji, we remember, and we celebrate just how many people you helped. I want to thank you and your wife, Ray, who couldn’t be here with you today, and your brother Edwin, for all your family has done for this nation. We will forever honor your commitment to your crew, your allies, and to your country.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:55)', 'Speech': 'April 14th, 1972, The Battle of Fire Support Base Charlie. The lone American on the base, serving as a senior advisor to the army of the Republic of Vietnam, was Major John Duffy. They called him Dusty Cyanide. That was his call name. Those days leading up to April 14th, the battalion command post had been destroyed. Major Duffy had already been twice wounded, refusing evacuation. Efforts to resupply the base had failed, and FSB Charlie was surrounded by the battalion-sized element. For hours, American gunships guided by Dusty Cyanide took airstrikes on enemy positions. Major Duffy repeatedly exposed himself to danger, in order to direct the gunships’ fire, and keep the battalion from being overrun. He even called in one strike, an extreme danger, close to his own position, in order to drive back the advancing attack. When he was wounded again, he again refused evacuation. He worked side by side to organize the defense of the base with the Vietnamese commander. Major Miley, who is here today… Major, where are you? Major, thank you for being here. Thank you for your service. It’s honor to have you here.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:27)', 'Speech': 'When they finally had to abandon in the base, Major Duffy volunteered to lead the rear squad, and cover their retreat. When the withdrawing soldiers were ambushed early on April 15th, and many of the injured troops scattered, Major Duffy remained with those who were wounded, rallying them to make it to an established evacuation zone, despite being constantly pursued by the Viet Cong. Upon reaching the exfiltration site, Major Duffy again made sure he was the last to board the helicopter. When finally, the air ship was ready to depart, one of his Vietnamese allies was shot in the foot, causing him to fall backwards out of the helicopter. Major Duffy caught him, and dragged him back in on board with him, saving one more life along the way.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:19)', 'Speech': 'Major Duffy served in the Army until 1977, completing three tours in Vietnam, numerous special forces assignments, and 20 years of faithful service to our country, after which, he went on to a successful career as an author, and was even nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for poetry. He is the definition of a warrior poet, enduring devotion to those he served with, and those who serve our nation still. Thank you Major Duffy for all that you’ve inspired in others. As Commander in Chief, I know this is not only for those who wear the uniform of our nation who serve, it’s your families as well. Mary, thank you for all that you’ve sacrificed over the years as well. To Marcus and Jud, I want to emphasize what you already know. Your grandpa’s a hero, a flat out, unadulterated hero.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:13)', 'Speech': 'We’re able to take these actions today, to upgrade the awards that properly honor the duty and devotion of those soldiers, thanks to individual dedication of those who served with them, and because of a congressionally ordered review of the heroic action of Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders awarded the Distinguished Service Cross during the Korean and Vietnam wars, to make sure we properly honor the contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and their service they’ve made over the years.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:44)', 'Speech': 'We did a similar view of World War II era awards. That resulted in 22 Medal of Honors being awarded Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders service members who had previously been under-recognized, including a very close friend of mine, one of my closest friends and benefactors in the United States Senate, Danny Inouye, United States Senator. I want to also thank the members of Congress who helped make this possible, to ensure that the United States lives up to our promises, that for those who give their best for our country, we will always give our best to you. I also want to take a moment to recognize three other Medal of Honor recipients, awarded for their heroic actions in Vietnam, who are with us today. Walter Martin. Walter, where are you? There you go, stand up Walter. James McCloughan. Brian Thacker. Thank you for being here, to help us recognize these newest honorees. I want to also note that last week, we lost a giant in this community. Herschel Woody Williams passed away at the age of 98, the last Medal of Honor recipient of World War II. Honored by President Harry Truman for his valor during the battle of Iwo Jima, Woody Williams will soon lie in honor in the United States Capital. His passing is a reminder of what so many Americans of our greatest generation sacrificed to preserve liberty and democracy, for our nation and for the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (20:36)', 'Speech': 'Now, it’s my great honor to ask for the citations to be read, as we award the Medal of Honors to the late Staff Sergeant Edward N.

Sensing the opportunity to ambush the infantry squads, the entrenched enemy force erupted with machine gun and small-arms fire against the two squads at the center of the village, killing the platoon leader and the point man, wounding four others, then successfully suppressing the surviving Soldiers.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (22:51)', 'Speech': 'Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro moved with his men to the sounds of the fire. Swiftly reading the situation, seeing that fire from the trench had to be stopped if anyone was to survive, he first deployed his men to cover, then crawled forward to attack the enemy force alone. He began by throwing grenades from the parapet while flattened to the ground, successfully throwing the first grenade through the aperture of the bunker, eliminating the machine gunner who had opened the action. With five grenades remaining and his rifle to sustain the assault, Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro jumped into the trench to sweep its length where it fronted the two pinned squads. Over the distance of about 35 meters, he worked the ditch alone, destroying one enemy group with rifle fire and two others with grenades.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (23:37)', 'Speech': 'By the end of his sweep, the able bodied survivors of the two squads were against standing and preparing to move the dead and wounded. Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro’s actions enabled the orderly extrication and reorganization of the platoon, which ultimately led to a successful withdrawal from the village.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (23:55)', 'Speech': 'Staff Sergeant Kaneshiro’s conspicuous, gallantry and uncommon heroism under fire are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (24:08)', 'Speech': 'Signed Joseph R.

Birdwell, United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry, and intrepidity at the risk of his own life, above and beyond the call of duty. Specialist 5 Dwight W. Birdwell distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving with C Troop, 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 25th Infantry Division, in the Republic of Vietnam on 31, January, 1968. On this date, C Troop was ordered to move south to help repel an enemy attack on Tan Son Nhut Air Base. As the C Troop column of tanks and armored personnel carriers approached the west gate of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, it became under intense enemy fire from a building at its right.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (26:19)', 'Speech': 'Unbeknown to C Troop, it had driven directly into an enemy force consisting of three battalions. The column tried to push through the initial attack, but the lead tank, crippled by rocket propelled grenade explosions, was blocking the way forward. C Troop immediately came under heavy enemy fire from both sides of the road. Specialist 5 Birdwell, upon seeing that his tank commander was wounded by enemy fire, immediately went to his aid. Under intense enemy fire, he lowered the injured tank commander to the ground and moved him to safety.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (26:50)', 'Speech': 'Specialist 5 Birdwell then, with complete disregard for his own safety, mounted the tank and assumed the tank commander’s position. Standing in the tank commander’s hatch with the upper half of his body exposed to heavy enemy fire Specialist 5 Birdwell used the enemy tank’s 50 caliber machine gun and 90 millimeter main gun to suppress the enemy attack. With ammunition for the 90 millimeter main gun exhausted, he continued to fire the 50 caliber machine gun until it overheated. At this point, Specialist 5 Birdwell, rather than abandoning his position, continued to engage the enemy with his M16 rifle, sometimes exposing his entire body to fire in order to engage the enemy from a better vantage point.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (27:33)', 'Speech': 'When a US helicopter crashed nearby, Specialist 5 Birdwell, under withering enemy fire, dismounted and moved to the helicopter where he retrieved two M60 machine guns and ammunition. After giving one M60 and ammunition to a fellow soldier, he remounted his tank and used the other M60 to again engage the enemy. Specialist 5 Birdwell continued to engage the enemy with complete disregard for his own safety until the M60 he was firing was hit by enemy fire. Specialist 5 Birdwell, now wounded in the face, neck, chest, and arms, dismounted the tank but refused to be medically evacuated. Instead Specialist 5 Birdwell, under enemy fire, rallied fellow soldiers to advance toward the front of the armored column, where they set up a defensive position by a large tree. From this position. He and the other soldiers engaged the enemy with M16 fire and grenades.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (28:26)', 'Speech': 'As the enemy fire lessened, Specialist 5 Birdwell gathered ammunition from disabled vehicles and helped wounded soldiers moved to safer positions.

The aircraft’s primary approach, the bullet infested landing zone, was thwarted by heavy volumes of enemy fire directed at the Specialist’s helicopter.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (31:23)', 'Speech': 'As the pilot made a second landing attempt, the enemy concentrated a barrage of flack at the air ambulance, which damaged the craft and caused it to crash in the conflict area. Injuring Specialist 5 Fujii. Moments later, another American helicopter successfully landed near the wreckage of the Specialist air ship and extracted all the down crewmen except for Specialist 5 Fujii, who was unable to board the helicopter due to intense enemy fire directed at him.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (31:49)', 'Speech': 'Rather than further endanger the lives of his comrades aboard the second helicopter, Specialist 5 Fujii waved the craft out of the combat area and remained behind as the only American on the battlefield. Subsequent attempts to rescue the Specialist were aborted due to violent anti-aircraft fire. Specialist 5 Fujii finally secured a radio and informed the aviators in the area that the landing zone was too hot for further evacuation attempts.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (32:14)', 'Speech': 'During the night and all through the next day, Specialist 5 Fujii disregarded his own wounds as he administered first aid to the allied casualties. On the night of 19 February, the allied perimeter came under ruthless assault by a reinforced enemy regimen supported by heavy artillery. Once again obtaining a radio transmitter, Specialist 5 Fujii called in American helicopter gunships to assist the small unit in repelling the attack.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (32:40)', 'Speech': 'For a period of over 17 consecutive hours, Specialist 5 Fujii repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire as he left the security of his entrenchment to better observe enemy troop positions and to direct airstrikes against them. At times, the fighting became so vicious that Specialist 5 Fujii was forced to interrupt radio transmissions in order to place suppressive rifle fire on the enemy while at close-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (33:03)', 'Speech': '… in order to place suppressive rifle fire on the enemy while at close quarters. Though wounded and severely fatigued by 20 February, the specialist bore the responsibility for the protection and defense of the friendly encampment until an American helicopter could land and attempt to airlift him from the area. As his air ambulance left the battlefield, it received numerous hits and was forced to crash-land at another South Vietnamese Ranger base approximately four kilometers from the specialist’s original location. The totally exhausted Specialist 5 Fuji remained at the allied camp for two more days until yet another helicopter could return him to Foul Bay for medical assistance on 22, February. Specialist, 5 Fuji’s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in the keeping of the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army. Signed, Joseph R. Biden, the President of the United States. Major John J. Duffy. Attention to orders, the President of the United States of America, authorized by act of Congress, March 3rd, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress, the Medal of Honor to Major John J. Duffy, United States Army, for conspicuous gallantry, and intrepidity at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty. Major John J. Duffy distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as the senior advisor to the 11th Airborne Battalion, 2nd Brigade Airborne Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam, during the period of 14 to 15, April 1972. In the two days preceding the events of 14 to 15, April 1972, the commander of the 11th Airborne Battalion was killed the battalion command post was destroyed, and Major Duffy was twice wounded but refused to be evacuated. Then on 14 April Major Duffy directed the defense of Fire Support Base Charlie, which was surrounded by a battalion-size enemy element, in the morning hours after a failed effort to establish a landing zone for resupply aircraft, he moved close to the enemy anti-aircraft positions to call in airstrikes. At this time, Major Duffy was again wounded by fragments from a recoilless rifle round, and again refused medical evacuation. Shortly thereafter, the enemy began an artillery bombardment on the base, and he remained in an exposed position to direct gunships onto enemy positions, which eventually silenced the enemy fire.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (36:37)', 'Speech': 'Following the bombardment, Major Duffy assessed the conditions on the base and personally ensured the wounded friendly foreign soldiers were moved to positions of relative safety and the remaining ammunition was appropriately distributed to the remaining defenders. Shortly thereafter, the enemy resumed in direct fire on the base expending an estimated 300 rounds. Nevertheless, he remained in an exposed position to direct gunship fire on the enemy positions. In the late afternoon hours, the enemy began a ground assault from all sides of the fire base and Major Duffy moved from position to position to adjust fire, spot targets for artillery observers, and ultimately to direct gunship fire on a friendly position, which had been compromised.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (37:19)', 'Speech': 'As the evening wore on, it became clear that the defenders could not withstand the overwhelming enemy forces and he began to organize an evacuation of the fire base under the cover of night. With the goal of a complete withdrawal, Major Duffy was the last man off base, remaining behind to adjust covering fire from gunships until the last possible moment. When the acting battalion commander was wounded, he assumed command of the evacuation and maintained communication with available air support, to direct fire on the enemy. In the early morning hours of 15 April, the enemy ambushed the battalion, inflicting additional casualties and scattering some of the able-bodied soldiers. Major Duffy organized defensive positions during the ambush and ensured the friendly foreign forces could successfully repulse the enemy. After withstanding the ambush, he led the evacuees, many of whom were significantly wounded, to an established evacuation area, despite continually being pursued by the enemy.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (38:19)', 'Speech': 'Upon reaching the exfiltration site Major Duffy directed gunship fire on the enemy positions and marked a landing zone for the helicopters. Only after ensuring all of the evacuees were on board, did Major Duffy board while also assisting a wounded friendly foreign soldier in with him. Once on board, he administered aid to a helicopter door gunner who had been wounded during the evacuation. Major Duffy’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness, above and beyond the call of duty, were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army. Signed, Joseph R. Biden, President of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'General: (39:50)', 'Speech': 'Please join me in receiving this blessing as we depart. Most holy God, thank you for the lives of these men who inspire and challenge us to extraordinary acts of service. May each of us dare to follow the examples of the warriors in the face of seemingly insurmountable moments of danger and crisis and be like them in kind. Bless Specialist Birdwell, Specialist Fuji, Major Duffy, and the Kaneshiro family. As the names of these men are forever etched into our nation’s proud history, and the Pantheon of heroes who have gone before, may their legacies be the true north for us to seek and may we all strive to be strong and courageous in the face of a myriad of challenges that life may bring our way. Keep the lamp of liberty burning bright and our nation strong. It is in your holy and mighty name, I pray. Amen.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (40:54)', 'Speech': 'I think we’re dismissed.

I would like anyone to come to an Iron Worker’s Local 17 meeting. Talk about upbeat. It’s more than that. I’ll guarantee you.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (00:19)', 'Speech': 'Good afternoon. My name’s Bill DeVito. I’m a retired iron worker out of local 17 Cleveland, Ohio. I’ll get some flack for this one. I joined the iron workers in 1973 and worked in the trade for nearly 40 years. Been retired from about 2012. I get teased about that.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (00:51)', 'Speech': 'At that time, our pension plan was in trouble in 1912, things were having problems. Local 17 funds were barely surviving the last recession. And just like a lot of people, we were struggling. Our pension plan was failing and if we didn’t take action, funds would be expected to run dry within the next handful of years. Members of Local 17 came together and made some very tough decisions and we voted to take significant cuts to our monthly benefits.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (01:30)', 'Speech': 'This was tough. In order to prolong along the life of the plan. No one expected the cuts to be 20 to 40%. This was devastating. Anybody that was married with kids trying to help out college. Retirement dreams gone, but we could save the plan, not just for ourselves, but for the younger iron workers coming up behind us. We took the cut. So that’s what we did. We kept the fund afloat, but we sank the retirement plan.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (02:15)', 'Speech': 'And that, with so many of our union brothers and sisters had dreamed about, our retirement. But we never stopped fighting. So with the lives disrupted, we needed to pass the Butch Lewis Act and to restore the retirement of the hardworking people like me, even when people said it was impossible, we never gave up hope. And neither did the friends like Sherrod Brown, Marcy Kaptur, Marty Walsh, Joe Biden. I just about shook their hands off when they were back there. And we won against all odds. We won a president and a Congress that believes in keeping promises to working people. As president, Joe Biden has done more for unions than any president that I can recall and I’ve been around a long time. Just look at this gray hair.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (03:41)', 'Speech': 'Workers like me and unions like Iron Workers Local 17 have been promised quite a bit over the years, but no other administration has done anything to help our pension funds regardless of any promises that they’ve made. The American Rescue Act is important for working families, just like mine. Here in Cleveland and across the country, we work hard for every dollar we earn, but some days it feels like the odds are stacked against us.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (04:22)', 'Speech': 'Even in retirement, we hear about banks, big corporations getting huge tax cuts and breaks or collecting a bailout when they get into any kind of trouble. But the blue collar guy like me, people in this room, we don’t get breaks like that. It’s pretty incredible that it’s not something you heard about such a happy ending with the act that had been passed.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (05:04)', 'Speech': 'I am a recipient of ARPA support for multi-employer pension plans. And I may be the front man here today, but so many people, our President, Joe Biden, Senator Sherrod Brown, Representative Marcy Kaptor, they’re the force behind this. Thank you. Thank you. And the hardworking men and women of the American labor movement have worked for so many years. They are the real heroes.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (05:53)', 'Speech': 'And now it’s my great honor to introduce the man who made this day possible. Many politicians promised, dangled and delayed pension rescue; Joe Biden delivered life changing aid, so many people like me, please welcome to the stage true friend of labor, let’s hear it Cleveland, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:51)', 'Speech': 'Hello Cleveland. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to the orchestra. Thank you very much. Well, let me start off by saying I’d get in trouble with my mother were she here if I didn’t say it, excuse my back when I’m speaking. I apologize. Number one. You have my…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:14)', 'Speech': 'Hello Cleveland. Before I begin though, I want to make one serious comment about the shooting and death of Jayland Walker. The Justice Department and Civil Rights Division of the FBI field office in Akron, Ohio, and the local US Attorney’s office are closely monitoring and reviewing what happened. And the FBI continues to coordinate with state and local partners to provide resources and specialized skill. If the evidence reveals potential violations of federal criminal statutes, the Justice Department will take the appropriate action and I just want you to know what’s going to happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:51)', 'Speech': 'Now for today’s program. Thank you Bill for that introduction and for the welcome on behalf of the Iron Workers Local 17 here in Cleveland. Iron workers.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (09:03)', 'Speech': 'We have the iron workers, Local 17 here in Cleveland. Iron workers were with me the first time I ran 29-year-old kid in the Senate, and you’re all crazy. You got a guy named Tommy Shrank was the president of the local in Delaware. And he said, “Let’s go out and meet some of the guys and women.” We went out to a building construction site. We went up a makeshift elevator. We went up to 13 floors. They’re sitting on 18-inch beams eating their lunch. I’m thinking myself, my God, these guys are supporting me. But they’re the guys I grew up with.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (09:35)', 'Speech': 'You know, the people you heard speak earlier today, and I apologize, I’m going to repeat some of what they said. But you know, we all come from the neighborhood. We all come from… No, I mean it. I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which was a union town, mostly coal mine, union town, a lot more. My great-grandfather was a, was worked in the mines was a mining engineer. And everybody there, there was only one word you heard most often in my family, not a joke, most important word wasn’t unions, it was dignity. Dignity. Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (10:17)', 'Speech': 'My dad, then we moved to a little town. When coal died, we moved to a town called Claymont, Delaware, just across the line from Pennsylvania where the Delaware River bends. And you know, used to have over 6,000 steel workers. We’re steal. It’s all gone, now. All of it gone. Used to be a company town, literally. The Hills were all company stores, company buildings, but it’s gone. And the union movement began to just crumble in Delaware and in Claymont.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (10:56)', 'Speech': 'And my dad never belonged to a union, but I say this to the front end, my dad was a salesperson and he came down from Scranton, when coal died, he wasn’t a coal miner, but he worked in sales up there. And I’ll never forget. We lived in a three bedroom split level home, like a lot of suburban areas developing in the early ’50s, mid ’50s. And there were I think 38, 40 homes. And we had four kids in the family and a grandpa living with us and mom and dad. And the walls were thin. And my dad, one night I could tell he was really restless. I could hear him and sort of not banging, but leaning up against the wall, in the room, in my room. Next morning, I asked… My dad had an expression. He said, “Joey, you never complained and never explain. Just get up. Just get up.” And I was wondering what was wrong. And asked my mom. She said, the company says, “No pensions.” No pensions.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (11:54)', 'Speech': 'And so, a lot of you come from families like mine. A lot of the people stood behind me. Richie Neal from the state of Massachusetts. He is, as my uncle would say, Richie is, he is union from belt buckle to shoe sole, man. But all the folks you heard speak today, care about it. Because we know what it’s like to be deprived of your dignity. We know what it’s like to have a father or a mother have to put their head down, and know they can’t afford a thing for their kid that they need, whether it’s a prescription or whether it’s just plain being able to go off to school.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (12:32)', 'Speech': 'And to a point I want to make is this. We all understand this. And when I ran for office this time and I’ve been a union supporter for my whole career, but I made a promise. I mean it sincerely, and Marty knows this. I guaranteed when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed and back in the ’30s and Roosevelt came along, it didn’t say unions were okay. It says we should encourage unions. Encourage unions. Because when unions do well, everybody does well. Everybody does well. Not a joke. Not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (13:15)', 'Speech': 'So here’s the deal. The deal was quite simple. When I ran, I was criticized for the basis upon which I ran. I said, I’m running for three reasons. One to restore the soul of America, the decency and honor of this country. And two to rebuild the backbone of the country. The backbone of the country are the working women and men, the middle class, and you know, there’s a middle class for one reason, American unions. That’s the only reason there’s a middle class. Not a joke. That’s a fact, not a joke. And when the middle class does well, everybody does well. People have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. And so folks in the third reason I ran was to unify the country. To unify. That’s been the harder part of it right now. No, I’m serious because we’ve become so divided. So divided in this. But one thing we were divided on when we ran and I want to thank Mayor Bibb for the passport of the city, but we were divided on the question we’re celebrating today.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (14:24)', 'Speech': 'And folks, how about actually having a union guy as Secretary of Labor. Isn’t that something. Thank you, Marty. And I know we have a fantastic Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Cleveland’s own Marsha Fudge. She wish she going to be here. I’m also honored to be here with Senator Sherrod Brown, a great champion of working folks. He really is. He really is. And thank you also for the incredible democratic members of Congress here, Marcy Kaptur. God love you, Marcy. You are the best. She does it all, unions and foreign policy. You think I’m joking. I’m not joking. She really knows more about foreign policy. She’s forgotten more than most members of Congress know. And Shontel Brown can just remembered me when you’re president. Okay. All right. Congratulations.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (15:20)', 'Speech': 'Look. And Richie Neil is not only a strong, strong union supporter and been a great supporter of this legislation, but he’s chairman of the most powerful committee in the United States Congress, the House of Ways and Means Committee, the guys with the money. The guys and the money. And he’s led on labor issues for decades. While they couldn’t be here, I also want to thank Senator Tim Ryan, future Senator Tim Ryan, and Senator Patty Murray, the state of Washington for their incredible work on this legislation. With everyone’s leadership and with their votes, and most of all, with the unrelenting commitment of labor and all of you this historic day is made possible. And it really is historic. This was $90 billion, okay? But it’s small in comparison to the bailouts of businesses and major corporations and banks.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (16:20)', 'Speech': 'And folks, I’m here today to talk about the issue that affects every single American in their retirement. People around the country, wake up every day, wondering whether they’ve saved enough to provide for themselves and their families before they stop working. Working a job that provides basic dignity, a good middle class job. You can raise a family on a job that provides a dignified retirement and will give you peace of mind.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (16:46)', 'Speech': 'Think of all the people. And many of you went to bed at night, putting your head in the pillow and saying, am I going to be all right? Is my family going to be all right? Is my wife or my husband or my child, they going to be okay? It’s a dignified retirement with your spouse or the home and your community, you worked and lived for your whole life. But the reality is for so many people, the goal post keep moving. Unfortunately, that’s probably Trump calling me. [inaudible 00:17:19] I hear that sound there.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (17:24)', 'Speech': 'Unfortunately, this happens to people who need it most, working people in this country. A lot of politicians like to talk about how they’re going to do something about it. Well, I’m here today to say we’ve done something about it. And I’ve kept a promise. I campaigned to restore the backbone of this country, the middle class in unions, because I know this, the middle class built American, unions built the middle class, and today I’m keeping a promise. One of the most significant achievement union workers in retirees have received in over 50 years. And that’s not hyperbole.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (18:02)', 'Speech': '… Over 50 years and that’s not hyperbole. For years and years, union workers have been driving trucks from factories to stores, bagging your groceries, constructing the buildings, bridges, roads we need and so much more. The iron workers, brick layers, carpenters, laborers, plumbers, truck, drivers, musicians. I might add food workers and so much more. And with each paycheck you earn, their employers, putting money into their pension plans. These workers work hard today to secure retirement for tomorrow. That’s what it’s all about. Now, a lot of businesses aren’t able or willing to run their own pension plans. And some industries workers are employed by several different employers over the course of a year or longer. For example, we see that in transportation, construction, and entertainment. So working with a union that represents their employees, businesses in the same industry often come together to form what’s called a Mueller employer union.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (19:01)', 'Speech': 'I know you know this, but people listening to this on television, may not know this. Pension plans that serve 11 million Americans across the country. And to make sure these pensions are managed responsibly and to protect the participating workers and retirees, the federal government oversees, then ensures the plans. But we’ve seen the risk that millions of workers face as they watch their hard earned pensions turn into broken promises. We saw it before the pandemic and the economic crisis that followed. Millions of retirees were at risk of losing their retirement security through no fault of their own, based on conditions and unrelenting attacks on unions that were taking place. Two hundred Mueller employee pension plants for two to 3 million workers and retirees were going in solvent. What that means to those two or 3 million workers, they faced painful cuts to the benefits they had counted on and for the dignified security retirement. You just heard from Bill what it’s like.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (20:08)', 'Speech': 'Work 30, 40, 50 years, working hard every single day, doing everything to provide for your family, track every dollar on that paycheck for groceries, mortgage, and hopefully for family vacation, maybe one day. And knowing when it’s time to retire, your pension you earn will be there. Knowing that together with your social security benefits that pension will continue a good middle class life for you in retirement. For some, my dad would say, “Just a little peace of mind.” But for folks at home, imagine losing 50 or 60% of that pension through absolutely no fault of your own. Imagine what it does financially and emotionally, what it does to your dignity. Also here is David Grubbs, retired Teamster, truck driver from North Carolina, who faced nearly 70% cutting his pension. And now, also joining me today as Rita Lewis. Where are you Rita? Rita’s here somewhere. I’m told she stepped out. I don’t blame her.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (21:19)', 'Speech': 'No, she’s Butch’s widow. Their anniversary is coming up in a couple days. Childhood sweethearts. Butch was a ball player drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of high school, but he enlisted the United States Army instead. Special Forces, Army ranger, served in Vietnam. Earned, like my son, the Bronze Star. My son did not earn the Purple Heart, but earned the Purple Heart. Came back home to [inaudible 00:21:45] settle in Cincinnati. Became a trucker represented by the Teamsters, and then president of his local. Known as an honorable, honest and decent labor leader, Butch faced severe cuts in his pension and he became a fierce advocate of protecting the pensions of those fellow workers. Butch died more than six years ago, and Rita has carried on his legacy ever since.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (22:11)', 'Speech': 'And with… And Democrats in Congress, I might add, and Marty Walsh’s leadership, we brought the Butch… We fought for the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions for millions of workers and retirees. As candidate for president, I argued for its passage and promised when it passed I would sign it. And that’s the promise I’ve kept when I included the Butch Lewis Act in the American rescue plan. Now, Mueller employee plans will remain solvent for decades and come at least until, guaranteed till 2051. These retirees, those retirees that have lost their benefits will have them restored retroactively. We turned a promise broken into a promise kept. It matters to workers. It matters to their families. It matters to the country. You all remember what the economy was like when I was elected. A country in a pandemic with no real plans how to get out of it. Millions of people out of their jobs, families in cars, remember? Backed up for literally miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. Just a box of food to be put in their trunk because they didn’t have enough to eat.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (23:31)', 'Speech': 'Previous administration lost more jobs in its watch than any administration since Herbert Hoover. That’s a fact. All based on failed trickle down economics that benefit the wealthiest Americans, and hit the middle class and working people the hardest. But we came in with a fundamentally different economic vision. An economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out is good for everyone because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. And that’s why we designed the American Rescue Plan based on the belief that a recovery should help all Americans prosper. A belief that working, building power and unions are good for workers and for the economy, a plan that led to the most jobs created in the first period of a presidency than any time, and over… In all American history. Now we’ve seen in the past how economic crisis can leave so many Americans in tough straits for years, sometimes for the rest of their lives. Economists call it the scarring effect. A lasting bad effects of economic hardship, including folks unemployed for a long time. Remember when we started this, a lot of people were equally as qualified, but they’d been an unemployed for 8, 10, 12 months. They wouldn’t even be considered. Two people put in an application. The person may be more qualified, been employed… Out of work for longer. It’s called the scarring effect. People not able to get back to work, period. But we changed that. And young people who have faced a weak labor market, they’re back. Losing a big part of your income late in life, that’s a scar though that doesn’t heal well. Not this time. Long term unemployment, youth unemployment dropped at a record pace. With today’s actions, millions of workers will have the dignified retirement they earned and they deserve. And folks, let’s be honest.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (25:39)', 'Speech': 'I’d love to tell you, everyone here, that this policy that honors hard work and ensures dignified retirement was universally supported regardless of political party. But this is an important point. And this really matters. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Not one single Republican. Not… No. This is just, I mean, this is what I’m talking about. Not one single solitary Republican voted for the Butch Lewis Act or this legislation. And folks, I can tell you those of us in the, were… I was in the Congress a long time, and the people that are still in the Congress. There’s ones who wanted to, but they’re afraid to afraid to. Because the Trumpers would literally take them out. Not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (26:27)', 'Speech': 'That’s how bad it’s gotten. We’ve got to change it. We’ve got to change it. In fact, when this bill was moving through Congress, Republicans called it, called these pensions quote, “rat holes.” That was their… No, that was the phrase on the floor. Rat holes. Who do they think they are? Who do they think you are, for God’s sake? And my predecessor had a chance to act, but he didn’t have a commitment to you or the courage to stand up to his own party, to get things done, dismissing and ignoring the forgotten people he promised to help.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (27:00)', 'Speech': 'Remember how he was going to help working class folks? But tax-'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (27:03)', 'Speech': '… promise to help. Remember how it’s going to help working class folks. But tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, he had no trouble passing that. They passed a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for, increased the debt by $2 trillion. The vast majority of people making the top 1% of income, the biggest corporations and their biggest cheerleaders in that $2 trillion tax cut. Again, disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. Protecting the system in which, for example, the 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies in America pay zero in taxes. Zero. They made $40 billion, didn’t pay a single penny. The party that chose to make life more comfortable for the already comfortable, disparage and oppose retirement security for working people. And now when Republicans actually do offer a plan, they finally…'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (27:59)', 'Speech': 'I’m not joking. Ask yourself this question. What is the Republican platform going into this campaign? No, I’m being deadly earnest. I’m not trying to be… Just a fact. Well, they have a guy, Rick Scott from Florida, who heads up the Republican Campaign Committee. He put out the plan. What does the plan do? It makes the tax system less fair by wanting to tax everybody making under a 100 thousand dollars significantly more on average, a lot more money. It actually raises taxes on those working families, because he thinks you don’t pay enough in taxes already. No, not a joke. I should have brought along the actual copy of the plan. You can go online and get… No, for real. It’s been published. They published it.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (28:48)', 'Speech': 'They think we’re freeloaders. But he’s got a problem with the tax code that allows billionaires… Not at all, no problem. Billionaires in America, there’s 789 or thereabouts. You know what the average federal income tax they pay? 8%. Every one of you that have a job pays more than 8%. Every single one of you. If you’re a cop, a teacher, a firefighter, a union worker, you probably pay two to three times that. Now after refusing to protect your pension, they’re going after your Social Security. Look. I would’ve thought, had I not seen it on paper and heard them talk about it, that I was making this up. Not a joke. There’s big idea is to put Social Security in the chopping block every five years. That is, every five years, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have to be reauthorized, or they go out of existence.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (29:40)', 'Speech': 'Social Security you paid in from the day you started working. It’s your other pension. You paid it in every single paycheck. You earned it. It’s your money, just like your pension. And he adds in Medicare and Medicaid for the chopping block every five years. Unless Congress explicitly votes to extend those programs, they go away. You know how they work the rules in the Senate. The ability to slow this up and keep that from happening is real. You know how hard it is to get anything done in Congress. Imagine what it would mean if Republicans had their way.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (30:15)', 'Speech': 'Look, the ultra-MAGA Republicans. Congress is deciding every five years, whether your promise of your hard earned Medicare, Social Security would be continued or discontinued, or slashed. It’s shameful, but Rick Scott’s not alone. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is talking…'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (30:35)', 'Speech': 'No. He has a proposal to cut Social Security. And by the way, I might note, parenthetically, as president… The first year I was as president, I cut the federal deficit by 350 billion dollars. And you know how much I cut it this year? By the end of September, I will have cut the federal budget by 1 trillion, 400 billion dollars. Cut the deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (31:08)', 'Speech': 'So they start talking about you being big spenders, there’s a point to that. But here’s the point. Republicans are talking about privatizing Social Security. No, this is not a joke. We used to hear this stuff and think they didn’t mean it, but they’ve written it down. The Senator of Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, promised again that if they regained power, they’re going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. What does that mean? It means that any of you having a preexisting condition will automatically lose insurance, because the insurance company won’t be able to… Right now, because of the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied insurance because they have a preexisting condition. By the way, we’re talking 90 million people with preexisting conditions, gone. Gone. They tried to do it about 17 times under Trump. We were able to stop them. But folks, this is a different world. I don’t know where they live. No, I’m not joking. That’s why elections have consequences. That’s why they matter. And that’s why what we’re doing here is so important.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (32:19)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. We made incredible progress on the economy from where we were a year and a half ago. We got a long way to go because of inflation, because of… I call it, the Putin Tax increase. Because of gasoline and all that grain he’s keeping from being able to get to the market. Now I’m fighting like hell to lower costs on things that you talk about around your kitchen table. My dad used to say, “At the end of the day, it’s just when you sit at that table, do you have enough money to pay for everything you need? Not a lot over. Do you have enough money to pay for everything you need?”'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (32:55)', 'Speech': 'Well, Republicans do nothing to obstruct our efforts to lower your gas taxes. I’ve proposed that. I’ve asked the Congress to eliminate the Federal Gas Tax as long as this crisis goes on. Lower food prices, lower healthcare costs, hopefully, soon, lower your prescription drug cost.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (33:12)', 'Speech': 'By the way, you got a Republican leader of the United States Senate. I was able to work out something with Intel. They’re going to provide for over 7,000 jobs in this state, out of Columbus, making computer chips. Well, there’s another bill that if we get it passed, and my guys are working like hell to pass it, it’ll create another hundred million dollars in investments in Ohio, creating more jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (33:51)', 'Speech': 'But you know what the Republican leader is saying? If in fact we pass the law that says Medicare can negotiate drug prices like they can for the military. If in fact we pass the plan that says, “We’re going to raise taxes on multimillionaires, so as they start paying their fair share,” that he’s going to block the passage of the legislation that will provide for another a hundred billion dollars invested in this state.'}, {'Time': 'Bill DeVito: (34:23)', 'Speech': 'Folks, this is not right. And that’s why this election is going to be so darn important. The key is that we just have to remember who built this country. I know I remember. Tomorrow, I’ll be awarding the highest honor that can be given to a civilian, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to our dear friend, the late Rich Trumka, who fought so damn hard for the protection of these pensions. He once said, “We do America’s work. Unions do America’s work.” This 4th of July, let’s remember who is the backbone of this country. It’s you, the American worker. I promised you I’d be the most pro-labor, pro-union, pro worker president of our history, and that’s another promise I’m going to be keeping as well. So let me tell you something. There’s no other place I want to be than right here with the workers in this room and the workers that build America. I see you. I hear you. And I’ll always have your back, I promise. God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

Before I speak to the Supreme Court extreme decision overturning Roe, I want to comment on one piece of good news, economic good news today. Today, the Labor Department reported that we added 372,000 jobs last month, 372,000.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:23)', 'Speech': 'Here’s why it’s important: Our private sector has now have recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic and added jobs on top of that. We have more Americans working today in the private sector than any day under my predecessor, more today than any time in American history, today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:43)', 'Speech': 'In the second quarter of this year, we created more jobs than any quarter under any of my predecessors in nearly 40 years before the pandemic. Think about that. At a time when our critics said the economy was too weak or having already added more jobs in my … we had already added more jobs my first year as President of any president in history, we still added more jobs in the past three months than any administration in nearly 40 years. Now, look, I know times are tough. Prices are too high. Families are facing a cost-of-living crunch. But today’s economic news confirms the fact that my economic plan is moving this country in a better direction. The unemployment rate is near a historic low of 3.6 percent. Private sector jobs are at a record high. Gas prices, still way too high, have fallen now 25 days in a row, and this week we saw the second-largest single-day decrease in gas prices in a decade. We still have a lot of work to do. I’m not suggesting … There’s a lot more work to do. But I am suggesting we’re making progress. The program is working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:51)', 'Speech': 'Now, with the Vice President, Secretary Becerra, and Deputy Attorney General Monaco, I want to talk about an executive order I’m signing to protect reproductive rights of women in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s terrible, extreme, and, I think, so totally wrongheaded decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. In both formalized actions I announced right after the decision, as well as adding new measures today. Let’s be clear about something from the very start. This was not a decision driven by the Constitution. Let me say it again: This was not a decision driven by the Constitution. And despite what those justices in the majority said, this was not a decision driven by history. You’ve all probably had a chance to the read the decision and the dissent. The majority rattles off laws from the 19th century to support the idea that Roe was historical anomaly because states outlawed abortion in the 1880s, toward the end. But that’s just wrong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:52)', 'Speech': 'The truth is today’s Supreme Court majority is playing fast and loose with the facts. Even 150 years ago, the common law and many state laws did not criminalize abortion early in pregnancy, which is very similar to the viability line drawn by Roe. But the Dobbs majority ignores that fact. And the Dobbs majority ignores that many laws were enacted to protect women at the time when they were dying from unsafe abortions. This is the horrific reality that Roe sought to end. The practice of medicine should not, let me emphasize, should not be frozen in the 19th century.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:34)', 'Speech': 'So, what happened? The dissenting opinion says it as clear as you can possibly say it. And here’s the quote: “Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reason to reach a different result than Roe and Casey did.” And that’s has changed, excuse me, and “All that has changed is this Court.” End of quote. “All that has changed is this Court.” That wasn’t about the Constitution or the law. It was about a deep, long-seething antipathy towards Roe and the broader right to privacy. As the justices wrote in their dissent, and I quote, “The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them.” End of quote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:20)', 'Speech': 'So, what we’re witnessing wasn’t a constitutional judgment. It was an exercise in raw political power. On the day the Dobbs decision came down, I immediately announced what I would do. But I also made it clear, based on the reasoning of the Court, there is no constitutional right to choose. The only way to fulfill and restore that right for women in this country is by voting, by exercising the power at the ballot box. Let me explain. We need two additional pro-choice senators and a pro-choice House to codify Roe as federal law. Your vote can make that a reality. I know it’s frustrating and it made a lot of people very angry. But the truth is this, and it’s not just me saying it; it’s what the Court said. When you read the decision, the Court has made clear it will not protect the rights of women. Period. Period.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:17)', 'Speech': 'After having made the decision based on a reading of a document that was frozen in time in the 1860s, when women didn’t even have the right to vote, the Court now practically dares the women of America to go to the ballot box and restore the very rights they’ve just taken away. One of the most extraordinary parts of the decision, in my view, is the majority writes, and I quote, “Women …” It’s a quote now, from the majority. “Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who registered to vote and cast a ballot is consistently higher than the percentage of the men who do so.” End of quote. Let me repeat the line: “Women are not without electoral and/or political …” or let me be precise; not and/or, ” … or political power.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:10)', 'Speech': 'That’s another way of saying that you, the women of America, can determine the outcome of this issue. I don’t think the Court or, for that matter, the Republicans who for decades have pushed their extreme agenda have a clue about the power of American women. But they’re about to find out, in my view. It’s my hope and strong belief that women will, in fact, turn out in record numbers to reclaim the rights that have taken from them by the Court. And let me be clear: While I wish it had not come to this, this is the fastest route available. I’m just stating a basic, fundamental notion. The fastest way to restore Roe is to pass a national law codifying Roe, which I will sign immediately upon its passage at my desk. And we can’t wait.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:59)', 'Speech': 'Extreme Republican governors, extreme Republican state legislatures, and Republican extremists in the Congress overall, all of them have not only fought to take away our rights, but they’re now determined to go as far as they can. Now the most extreme Republican governors and state legislatures have taken the Court’s decision as a green light to impose some of the harshest and most restrictive laws seen in this country in a long time. These are the laws that not only put women’s lives at risk, these are the laws that will cost lives. What we’re witnessing is a giant step backwards in much of our country. Already, the bans are in effect in 13 states. Twelve additional states are likely to ban choice in the coming weeks. And in a number of these states, the laws are so extreme they have raised the threat of criminal penalties for doctors and healthcare providers. They’re so extreme that many don’t allow for exceptions, even for rape or incest. Let me say that again: Some of the states don’t allow for exceptions for rape or incest. This isn’t some imagined horror. It’s already happening.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:08)', 'Speech': 'Just last week, it was reported that a 10-year-old girl was a rape victim in Ohio, 10 years old, and she was forced to have to travel out of the state to Indiana, to seek to terminate the presidency and maybe save her life. The last part is my judgment. Ten years old. Ten years old, raped, six weeks pregnant. Already traumatized. Was forced to travel to another state. Imagine being that little girl. I’m serious, just imagine being that little girl. Ten years old. Does anyone believe that it’s the Ohio’s majority view that that should not be able to be dealt with, or in any other state in the nation? A 10-year-old girl should be forced to give birth to a rapist’s child? I can tell you what: I don’t. I can’t think of anything that’s much more extreme.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:14)', 'Speech': 'The Court’s decision has also been received by Republicans in Congress as a green light to go further and pass a national ban. A national ban. Remember what they’re saying. They’re saying there’s no right to privacy, so therefore it’s not protected by the Constitution, so left it up to the state and the Congress, what they want to do. And now my Republican friends are talking about getting the Congress to pass a national ban. The extreme positions that they’re taking in some of these states. That will mean the right to choose will be illegal nationwide if, in fact, they succeed. Let me tell you something: As long as I’m President, it won’t happen, because I’ll veto it. So the choice is clear. If you want to change the circumstances for women and even little girls in this country, please go out and vote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:13)', 'Speech': 'When tens of millions of women vote this year, they won’t be alone. Millions and millions of men will be taking up the fight alongside them to restore the right to choose and the broader right to privacy in this nation, which they denied existed. And the challenge from the Court to the American women and men, this is a nation. The challenge is: Go out and vote. Well, for God’s sake, there’s an election in November. Vote, vote, vote, vote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:48)', 'Speech': 'Consider the challenge accepted, Court. But in the meantime, I’m signing this important executive order. I’m asking the Justice Department that, much like they did in the Civil Rights era, to do something, do everything in their power to protect these women seeking to invoke their rights. In states where clinics are still open, to protect them from intimidation. To protect the right of women to travel from a state that prohibits seeking the medical attention that she needs to a state to provide that care. To protect a woman’s right to the FDA-approved, Federal Drug Administration-approved medication that’s been available for over 20 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:31)', 'Speech': 'The executive order provides safeguards to access care. A patient comes into the emergency room in any state in the union. She’s expressing and experiencing a life-threatening miscarriage, but the doctor is going to be so concerned about being criminalized for treating her, they delay treatment to call the hospital lawyer who is concerned the hospital will be penalized if a doctor provides the lifesaving care. It’s outrageous. I don’t care what your position is. It’s outrageous, and it’s dangerous. That’s why this executive order directs the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to ensure all patients, including pregnant women and girls experiencing pregnancy loss to get emergency care they need under federal law, and that doctors have clear guidance on their own responsibilities and protections no matter what state they’re in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:32)', 'Speech': 'The executive order protects access to contraception, that I’m about to sign. Justice Thomas himself said that under the reasoning of this decision, this is what Justice Thomas said in his concurring opinion, that the Court should reconsider the constitutional right to contraception, to use contraception even among married couples. What century are they in? There used to be a case called Connecticut v. Griswold, which was declared unconstitutional in the late ’60s. It said a married couple in the privacy of their bedroom could not decide to use contraception. Right now, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the Affordable Care Act guarantees insurance coverage for women’s health services, including free birth control. The executive order directs HHS to identify ways to expand access to reproductive health services, like IUDs, birth control pills, emergency contraception.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:43)', 'Speech': 'And equally important, this executive order protects patient privacy and access to information, which looking at the press assembled before me, probably know more about it than I do. I’m not a tech guy. I’m learning. But right now, when you use a search engine or the app on your phone, companies collect your data, they sell it to other companies, and they even share it with law enforcement. There’s an increasing concern that extremist governors and others will try to get that data off of your phone, which is out there in the ether, to find what you’re seeking, where you’re going, and what you’re doing with regard to your healthcare. Talk about no privacy, no privacy in the Constitution. There’s no privacy, period. This executive order asks the FTC to crack down on data brokers that sell private information to extreme groups or, in my view, sell private information to anybody. It protects private health information in states with extreme laws.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:50)', 'Speech': 'And the executive order strengthens coordination at the federal level. It establishes a task force, led by the the Department of Human Services, focused specifically on using every federal tool available to protect access to reproductive healthcare. Let me close with this: The Court and its allies are committed to moving America backward with fewer rights, less autonomy, and politicians invading the most personal of decisions. Remember the reasoning of this decision has an impact much beyond Roe and the right to privacy generally. Marriage equality, contraception, and so much more is at risk. This decision affects everyone, unrelated to choice, beyond choice. We cannot allow an out-of-control Supreme Court, working in conjunction with the extremist elements of the Republican Party, to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:53)', 'Speech': 'The choice we face as a nation is between the mainstream and the extreme, between moving forward and moving backwards, between allowing politicians to enter the most personal parts of our lives and protecting the right to privacy. Yes, yes, embedded in our Constitution. This is a choice. This is a moment, the moment. The moment to restore the rights that have been taken away from us and the moment to protect our nation from an extremist agenda that is antithetical to everything we believe as Americans. Now, I’m going to sign this executive order. The executive order is Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (17:03)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, what does Prime Minister Abe’s death last night say about the security situation in Japan? And can you give us an update on your thinking about lifting China tariffs, please?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:15)', 'Speech': 'Let me … I tried to put a call in the present Prime Minister. It was very late there at night. I’ll be talking there in the morning. I’m going to be stopping to sign the condolence book at the Japanese embassy on the way to the CIA. This hasn’t happened to Japan in decades and decades, I’m told, all the way back to the late ’30s or mid-’30s. And it’s a homemade weapon. I’ve only seen a photograph of it. The Justice Department is going to be going in and giving me more detail later as they find out the detail.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:02)', 'Speech': 'But the fact is that one thing did get my attention: that this is the first use of a weapon to murder someone in Japan. And I think we have thus far have 3,000, don’t hold me to the number, 688 or, I mean, between 3 and 4,000 cases. They have one. One. One. And so, but we’re going to learn more, as time goes on, about motive, about the whole. But Fumio, the present Prime Minister, is a very solid guy. Japan is a very, very stable ally. And I do not believe it’s likely to have, but I don’t know yet, likely to have any profound, destabilizing impact on Japanese security or Japanese solidarity. Thank you all so very much.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (19:08)', 'Speech': 'Can we move on to tariffs as well, sir. Can you just give us your thoughts on lifting China tariffs?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:12)', 'Speech': 'I haven’t made that decision. We’re going through them one at a time.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (19:15)', 'Speech': 'Would you recommend-'}]"

Guerrero: (00:00)', 'Speech': 'Good morning.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (00:00)', 'Speech': 'Good morning.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (00:02)', 'Speech': 'My name is Dr. Roy A. Guerrero. I’m a pediatrician, and most importantly, I’m a born and raised Uvaldian. It is an honor to be here and celebrate the first major gun legislation in 30 years.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (00:22)', 'Speech': 'It’s been 40 days since the massacre and now the makeshift memorial in downtown Uvalde consisting of wooden crosses, children’s pictures, candles, and colorful ribbons has been taken down. The dried white roses and the sun bleach Teddy bears have been taken away and stored. What remains is the hollow feeling in our gut, as we drive through our sleepy downtown, which quickly turns to pain and anger, as we sometimes accidentally approach the grounds of Robb Elementary School, a place no one likes to visit. I’m using this pain to speak to you today as a Uvaldian and to speak for the parents and victims who seek the truth, transparency, and ultimately accountability.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (01:16)', 'Speech': 'These parents seek a safe and secure environment for their children. It’s been tough being a pediatrician in a community where children do not want to return to school and parents don’t want to send them there with the fear of a future attack. I see children daily with PTSD and anxiety that’s now leading to depression. I spend half my days convincing kids that no one is coming for them and that they’re safe. But how do I say that, knowing that the very weapons used in the attack are still freely available. Let this only be the start of the movement towards the banning of assault weapons. As I have said before, adults are stubborn. We’re resistant to change even when the change will make things better for ourselves. But especially when we think we’re immune to the fallout. As we have seen, no community is immune to the fallout. Rather, the fallout is landing in our backyard on a weekly basis.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Roy A. Guerrero: (02:23)', 'Speech': 'I commend the bipartisan legislators who work tirelessly to pass this bill. I thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for always standing with the community of Uvalde and allowing our voices to be heard. I invite everyone to move forward from this start of the change that will allow all of our children to make it to the end of our fight, which is a world where safety in schools is never doubted and weapons of war are not allowed in our communities. The Uvalde community thanks you for your love and support. And I’m honored to introduce our great champion, the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (03:16)', 'Speech': 'Good morning. Thank you, Dr. Guerrero for the introduction and for your courage and your compassion. You have been such a source of strength to the families of Vivaldi. And I know that is not without personal sacrifice. Thank you for your leadership. To our President, Joe Biden members of Congress, members of our administration, friends and fellow Americans, today is indeed an historic day. For 30 years, our nation has failed to pass meaningful gun violence legislation. Again and again, the American people have called for common sense action to protect our communities. Last month, Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (04:29)', 'Speech': 'Because, of our president’s leadership and because of so many of you, we have passed a law that will make communities around our nation safer. For my whole career, addressing gun violence has been one of my top priorities, first as a courtroom prosecutor, then as district attorney of San Francisco, where we created a gun specialist unit to go after violent offenders.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (04:56)', 'Speech': 'Then of course, as attorney general, where our office worked closely with the California bureau of firearms to investigate and seize firearms from those who unlawfully possess them. As a United States Senator, together with my former colleagues in the Senate, we supported various pieces of legislation to address this crisis. So I knew, and I know now, as so many of you do, that we are overdue in getting this work done, and I know it will save lives. Together, we gather with many of the leaders who made this law a reality. To the friends and family members of the victims of gun violence, in the face of so much pain, you have shown incredible strength, and it is a profound honor to stand with you today. To the members of Congress who are here with us in the face of so much pessimism, you passed a bipartisan law, you worked across the aisle and the product of that work will make our communities safer.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (06:15)', 'Speech': 'And that deserves applause. But as all of us know gathered here today, we would not be here, were it not for the vision, the courage, the unwavering determination of one particular individual, Joe Biden. Our president Joe Biden has fought for decades to end the terror of gun violence. He has taken on the gun lobby and won. As a Senator, Joe helped pass… Then I would’ve called him Joe, now I call him Mr. President… The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which as we know is a background check system that has prevented more than 3 million firearms from falling into dangerous hands. And he passed a 10 year ban on assault weapons in high capacity magazines. As vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama/Biden administration’s efforts to reduce gun violence. President Joe Biden knows the tremendous pain of gun violence. He has seen it up close. He has held hands with parents.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (08:03)', 'Speech': 'He has seen it up close. He has held hands with parents who lost children and with children who lost parents. President Biden knows the urgency of this fight and he will continue to do all in his power to protect the people of our nation. And now it is my honor to welcome Garnell Whitfield Jr., who I spent time with, and his family, mourning the loss of his beloved mother. Mr. Whitfield.'}, {'Time': 'Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (08:37)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Good morning.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (08:47)', 'Speech': 'Good morning.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:47)', 'Speech': 'Good morning.'}, {'Time': 'Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (08:48)', 'Speech': 'I’m at the wrong place. Madam Vice President, thank you for your kind introduction. But more importantly, on behalf of my sibling, Robin, Angela, Raymond, our father Garnell Sr. and our entire family, many of them whom are here today, but on behalf, especially my mom, we are eternally grateful and comforted by you and the second gentleman’s sincere expression of compassion and love shown by your attendance at our mother’s memorial service. As we shared with you then, she was a big supporter of you, and we are certain that she is still dancing around heaven all day just knowing that you were there.'}, {'Time': 'Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (09:40)', 'Speech': 'My name is Garnell Whitfield, Jr., and I’d like to begin my remarks by saying the names of the victims of the Buffalo massacre. Roberta Drury, Celestine Chaney, Andre Mackneil, Heyward Patterson, Katherine Massey, Margus Morrison, Aaron Salter, Geraldine Talley, Pearl Young and Mrs. Ruth E. Whitfield, our 86 year old mother, all of whom went to the only supermarket in their community on May 14th to pick up groceries, believing that they were safe, but they were not. The devastating reality is that an individual armed with a weapon of war walked in with cameras rolling and massacred them in the name of a hateful ideology. My family, our families and our community are devastated, but their intent to divide us and to promulgate further violence within our community has failed miserably, for we have instead chosen to love over hate, to speak out rather than stay silent and to stand with those courageous enough to lead us.'}, {'Time': 'Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (11:07)', 'Speech': 'To the signing of the most impactful gun legislation in over 30 years, we’re truly grateful for this day, but we know that this is only the first step. This new law will undoubtedly help and in some cases prevent future tragedies, but there is much more to do. We must address white supremacy and direct domestic terrorism. They’re the leading threat to our homeland and our way of life. So we must continue to fight.'}, {'Time': 'Garnell Whitfield Jr.: (11:42)', 'Speech': 'And because we are led by a president who understands and has characterized this fight as one for the soul of our nation, a president who, through his own trauma and vast set of experiences understands and empathizes with all of us, and I’m not just saying that to be saying it because in the midst of our pain, he and the first lady showed up and they put their arms around us and promised to not only see that our immediate needs were met, but to work every day to mitigate the gun violence and divisiveness that is plaguing our nation. So we believe that we are well prepared for the road ahead, but it is just the beginning of that journey. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct honor to introduce the person that we, the people, but more importantly, God, has chosen to lead us as such a time as this, President Joseph R.

Your heroism in treating wounded children in Uvaldi, many of whom you’ve known their whole lives and treated them with normal child problems as a pediatrician. It’s something we’ll never forget.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:35)', 'Speech': 'Garnell, it’s good to see you again. I know how tough it is. A lot of people in here have been victims of gun violence, lost sons, daughters, husbands, wives. They understand your pain. And every time you stand up to talk about it, even for a good cause, it brings it all back like it happened yesterday, but thank you for the courage to do it. Jill and I will never forget the time we spent with you and your families.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:08)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank the Vice President Harris and the second gentleman, members of the cabinet, eight of whom are here today, as well as mayors and elected officials from across the country. I want to particularly thank the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Highland Park for being here. We’ve had, no I mean it sincerely, we had a number of conversations immediately after the attack in Highland Park, and I’ve been impressed with the way they’ve handled things. It’s been extraordinary. And as the three of us have discussed, we have more to do. I also want to thank the bipartisan group of senators who worked so hard to get this done, especially senators Murphy, Sinema, Cornyn, and Tillis. Hope it doesn’t get you in trouble mentioning your name, thank you for your courage. As well as all the members of Congress who have worked on these issues for a long time, 80 of whom are with us today. And I’m sorry Senator Schumer and Blumenthal can’t be here today, but they’re working from home overcoming mild cases of COVID.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:22)', 'Speech': 'I know how hard it is to get things done because I know how hard it was to write the first gun legislation, at least the first one in my career, that was passed nearly 30 years ago. That’s how long ago it was. And as I look out in this crowd, I see so many advocates and families, many of whom have become friends, whose lives have been shattered by gun violence and who have made it their purpose to save other lives. I’ve spent so much time with so many of you over the years that we’ve actually become personal friends. I can’t thank you enough for your willingness to continue to fight for other families. Another.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': '… and is to continue to fight for other families. Nothing can bring back your loved ones, but you did it to make sure that other families don’t have to experience the same loss and pain that you’ve experienced. And you’ve felt, and you feel the price of an action that this has taken too long, with too much of a trail of bloodshed and carnage.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:25)', 'Speech': 'And I know public policy can seem remote, technical, and distant from our everyday lives, but because of your work, your advocacy, your courage, lives will be saved today, and tomorrow, because of this. What we’re doing here today is real. It’s vivid. It’s relevant. The action we take today is a step designed to make our nation the kind of nation we should be. It’s about the most fundamental of things; the lives of our children, of our loved ones.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:03)', 'Speech': 'We face, literally, a moral choice in this country. Moral choice with profound real world implications. Will we take wise steps to fulfill the responsibility to protect the innocent, and while keeping faith with the constitutional rights? Will we match thoughts and prayers with action? I say yes, and that’s what we’re doing here today.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:29)', 'Speech': 'Today is many things. It’s proof that despite the naysayers, we can make meaningful progress on dealing with gun violence, because make no mistake… Sit down, you’ll hear what I have to say. If you think-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (17:43)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:17:43].'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (17:50)', 'Speech': 'President Biden, yeah.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:53)', 'Speech': 'We have one. Let me finish my comments.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:56)', 'Speech': 'Let him talk. No one… Okay.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:59)', 'Speech': 'Because make no mistake about it, this legislation is real progress, but more has to be done. The provision of this new legislation’s going to save lives. And it’s proof that today’s politics, we can come together on a bipartisan basis to get important things done, even on an issue as tough as guns.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:21)', 'Speech': 'And one more thing. It’s a call to action to all of us to do more, to take away from the legislature, that’s not what we can do. The takeaway from this is that now, now we’re of opening to get much more done. Senator Murphy has said, when you look at the biggest social issues America has faced throughout our history, “Success begets success.” And that’s when you, “Finally move that mountain.” You can ignite a movement when you do that, for more progress to follow. We finally moved that mountain, a mountain of opposition, obstruction, and indifference that stood in the way and stopped every effort of gun safety for 30 years in this nation.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:11)', 'Speech': 'Now’s the time to galvanize this movement, because that’s our duty to the people of this nation. That’s what we owe those families in Buffalo, where a grocery store became a killing field. It’s what we owe those families in Uvalde, where an elementary school became a killing field. That’s what we owe those families in Highland Park, where on July 4th, a parade became a killing field. That’s what we owe all of those families represented here today and all over this country, the past many years, across our schools, places of worship, workplaces, stores, music festivals, nightclubs, and so many other everyday places that have turned into killing fields. And that’s what we owe the families all across this nation, where every day, tragic killings that don’t make the headlines are more than passing mention, little more than passing mention in the local news. Neighborhoods and streets have been turned into killing fields as well.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:09)', 'Speech': 'Today’s legislation is an important start, and here are the key things that it does; provides $750 million in crisis intervention and red flag laws, so the parent, a teacher, a counselor can flag for the court that a child, a student, a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening class space, or experiencing suicidal thoughts that makes them a danger to themselves and to others.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:34)', 'Speech': 'Fort Hood, Texas, 2009, 13 dead, 30 more injured. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 1918, 17 dead, 17 injured. In both places, countless others suffering with invisible wounds. In both places, red flag laws could have stopped both those shooters.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:59)', 'Speech': 'This new law requires young people, who are 21, to go on enhanced background checks before purchasing a gun. How many more mass shootings do we have to see, where a shooter is 17, 18 years old, and able to get his hands on a weapon and go on a killing spree?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:18)', 'Speech': 'It closes a so-called boyfriend loophole. If you’re convicted of assault against your girlfriend or boy… You can’t buy a gun, you can’t do it. According to a recent study, over 50% of mass shootings, the shooters shot a family member or a partner. So if we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, we can save the lives of their partners, and we can also stop more mass shootings.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:43)', 'Speech': 'One, this law includes the first ever federal law that makes gun trafficking and store purchase explicit federal crimes. It clarifies, who needs to register is a federal licensed gun dealer, and run background checks before selling a single weapon, and to invest in anti-violence programs, and work directly with the communities most at risk for gun crimes. And this law also provides funding vital for funding to address the youth mental health crisis in this country, including the trauma experienced by the survivors of gun violence.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:26)', 'Speech': 'It will not save every life from the epidemic of gun violence, but if this law had been in place years ago, even this last year, lives would’ve been saved. It matters. But it’s not enough, and we all know that.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:42)', 'Speech': 'In preparation for today’s signing, I asked to people to send me their stories about their experience with gun violence. I received over 2,500 responses in 24 hours. Didn’t get to read them all, but I read some. A 17 year old wrote me saying, ” A school shooting sophomore year had shattered every sense of normalcy I’ve ever felt. Almost three years later, I still have nightmares.” 24 year old wrote about growing up in what was “Seemingly endless era of gun violence.” A 40 year old wrote me about two friends shot and killed by abusive partners and former partners. Someone else wrote me about a six year old child who’s sitting near his father’s coffin, was asking “Why is daddy in that scary box? Wake up, daddy. Wake up, daddy.” His father had been gunned down. I read these stories and so many others.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:37)', 'Speech': 'And I see the statistics. Over 40,000 people died from gunshot wounds last year in the United States. 25,000 by suicide. I think, can this really be the United States of America? Why has it come to this? We all know a lot of the reasons. Gun…'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': 'How does it come to this? We all know a lot of the reasons. Gun lobby, gun manufacturers, special interest money, and the rise of hyperpartisan tribal politics in the country where we don’t debate issues on the merits, but we just rather turn on each other from our corners and attack the other side. Regardless, we’re living in a country awash in weapons of war, weapons that were designed to hunt are not being used. The weapon’s design that they’re purchasing, they’re designed as weapons of war, to take out an enemy.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:35)', 'Speech': 'What is the rationale for these weapons outside war zones? Some people claim it’s for sport or to hunt, but let’s look at the facts. Most common rounds fired from an AR-15 move almost twice as fast as that from a handgun, a couple of smaller, lighter bullets, these weapons maximize the damage done coupled with those bullets and human flesh and bone is just torn apart. And as difficult as it is to say, that’s why so many people in some in this audience, and I apologize for having to say it, need to provide DNA samples to identify the remains of their children. Think of that.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:17)', 'Speech': 'It’s why trauma surgeons who trained for years for these moments. No, it’s unlikely that someone shot with a high-powered assault weapon will make it long enough for the ambulance to get them to the hospital. It’s why these scenes of destruction resembling nothing like a weekend hunting trip for deer or elk. And yet, we continue to let these weapons be sold to people with no training or expertise.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:44)', 'Speech': 'Case in point, America has the finest fighting force in the world. We provide our service members the most lethal weapons on Earth to protect America. We also require them to receive significant training before they’re allowed to use these weapons. We require extensive background checks on them and mental health assessments on them, require that they learn how to lock up and store these weapons responsibly. We require our military to do all that. These are common sense requirements, but we don’t require the same common sense measures for a stranger walking into a gun store to purchase an AR-15 or some weapon like that. Makes no sense.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:25)', 'Speech': 'Assault weapons need to be banned. They were banned. I led the fight in 1994. Then, under pressure from the NRA and the gun manufacturers and others, that ban was lifted in 2004. In that 10 years, it was law. Mass shootings went down. When the law expired in 2004, and those weapons were allowed to be sold again, mass shootings tripled. They’re the facts. I’m determined to ban these weapons again and high capacity magazines that hold 30 rounds and to let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes. I’m not going to stop until we do it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:05)', 'Speech': 'Here’s another thing we should do. We should have safe storage laws requiring personal liability for not locking up your gun. The shooter in Sandy Hook came from a home full of guns and assault weapons that were too easy to access, weapons he used to kill his mother and then murdered 26 people, including 20 innocent first graders.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:33)', 'Speech': 'If you own a weapon, you have a responsibility to secure it and keep it under lock and key. Responsible gun owners agree. No one else should have access to it. So, lock it up, have trigger locks. And if you don’t and something bad happens, you should be held responsible. I have four shotguns, two are mine, and two are my deceased son’s. They’re locked up, lock and key. Every responsible gun owner that I know does that.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:16)', 'Speech': 'We should expand background checks to better keep guns out of the hands of felons, fugitive, and those under domestic violence restraining orders, expanded background checks are something that the vast majority of Americans, including the majority of gun owners agree on.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:34)', 'Speech': 'My fellow Americans, none of what I’m talking about infringes on anyone’s Second Amendment rights. I’ve said it many times. I support the Second Amendment, but when guns are the number one killer of children in the United States of America … Let me say that again. Guns are the number one killer of children in the United States, more than car accidents, more than cancer. And over the last two decades, more high school children have died from gunshots than on-duty police officer and active duty military combined. Think of that. Then, we can’t just stand by. We can’t let it happen any longer. With rights come responsibilities. Yes, there’s a right to bear arms, but we also have a right to live freely, without fear for our lives in a grocery store, in a classroom and a playground, at a house of worship, in a store, at a workplace, a nightclub, a festival, in our neighborhoods, in our streets.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (29:35)', 'Speech': 'The right to bear arms is not an absolute right to dominates all others. The perennial price for living in a community with others as being neighbors, of being fellow citizens, is that we obey the laws and customs that ensure that frame what the framers call domestic tranquility. That’s what civilization is. That’s what we have been at our best. That’s what America must always be, a place where we preserve the rights, but fulfill our responsibilities.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:04)', 'Speech': 'I know this. There can be no greater responsibility than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families, our children, and our fellow Americans. When I spoke to the nation after Uvalde, I shared how a grandmother who had lost her granddaughter gave me and Jill a handwritten letter. We spent four hours and almost five hours with them. And I read it. It reads, quote, “A race, the invisible line that is divided in our nation, to come up with a solution and fix what is broken and to make the changes that are necessary to prevent this from happening again.” End of quote.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:48)', 'Speech': 'That’s why we’re here. That’s why we’re here. Today, I want to thank those in Congress, both Democratic and Republicans who erase that invisible line dividing our nation and moved us forward on gun safety. It’s an important step. And now, we must look forward. We have so much more work to do, and I might add there’s $75 million in there for mental health reasons, a whole range of other things I’m not going to take time to go into today, but it’s important.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (31:17)', 'Speech': 'May God bless all of us with the strength to finish the work left undone. And on behalf of the lives we’ve lost and the lives we can save, may God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

Yes, and this has resulted in the inflationary spiral that the entire world is suffering. Therefore, President Biden, I have come to see you to express on behalf of the Mexican people our disposal, our willingness to work together for the wellbeing of our nations. This will not be the first nor the last location at which we close ranks to help each other win. In spite of our differences and also in spite of our grievances that are not really easy to forget with time or with good wishes, they’re not easy to forget.'}, {'Time': 'Translator: (13:55)', 'Speech': 'However, on many occasions we’ve been able to coincide and we’ve been able to work together as good friends and true allies. During President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration, we were able to see a policy that we believe it was a very efficient and very fraternal policy. Those were other times, however, we had circumstances that were quite similar to our existing circumstances. And from those policies, we should be extracting good lessons because history is the master of life. When President Roosevelt took office March 4th, 1933, the United States was going through one of the most profound social and economic crisis of its history.'}, {'Time': 'Translator: (15:53)', 'Speech': 'That’s why with great definition, determination, and [inaudible 00:16:09], since the first 100 days of its administration, he launched a whirlpool of initiatives that changed the country and gave new hopes to its inhabitants. Throughout his administration, he also applied. He enforced a policy, a good neighbor’s policy, and this is something that was enforced and applied throughout the American continent. Authenticity of this policy had, as its best example, respect for the sovereignty of Mexico. At that time, President Lázaro Cárdenas’ administration was also launching very deep, very important reforms. So then, in 1938, that’s when the oil expropriation took place in Mexico. However, differences were addressed and solved through a dialogue and collaboration with dignity. This policy of respect for the sovereignty of our country of the nations, in general, gave us very good fruit. Yes, for instance, it created conditions which were very favorable conditions for the governments of the United States and Mexico to act as partners, as allies throughout the Second World War. This alliance went beyond, over and beyond, mere corporation in this [inaudible 00:18:55] effort. When the United States went into the Second World War, thousands of Americans were recruited by the armed forces, and this meant that the agriculture field was left with non-labor force. Farmers urgently needed labor force. As it also happens now in restaurants, factories, the construction works, and out in the countryside as well. At that time, under those circumstances in 1943, President Roosevelt recognized reality and he decided to support the Bracero program. Through which thousands of Mexican agricultural laborers came into the United States legally to help in the production of good stuff. Even during the construction [inaudible 00:20:43] system in the United States, 1943 through 1946, 130,000 Mexican workers, farm workers, were hired through this agreement signed by both governments.'}, {'Time': 'Translator: (21:20)', 'Speech': 'Certainly, the program was not exempt from respect, abuses, and non-compliance. However, there is no doubt that there were very good results at the projective and labor levels. It was a more secure framework with less human rights violations. Especially, if we compare that to current migration provisions. Today, we’re proposing something similar to this program. It is true that the USMCA is a treaty that’s already uniting and integrating our three countries. Our three countries, Mexico, the United States, and Canada. However, there’s still margins for us to intensify our bilateral relationship.'}, {'Time': 'Translator: (22:53)', 'Speech': 'For instance, high inflationary rates have to do with misadjustments of the world economy. Because of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. However, we should also recognize that for some time now, we haven’t been producing what we should be producing.

Therefore, we decided that while we’re waiting for prices of gasoline to go down in the United States … And I hope that Congress approves or passes your proposal, Mr. President.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (27:17)', 'Speech': 'It’s come down for [inaudible 00:27:21].'}, {'Time': 'Translator: (27:21)', 'Speech': 'Lowering prices.

Right now a gallon of regular costs $4.78. Average, on this side of the border. And in our territory, $3.12. Let me clarify something. And I also want to take advantage of this opportunity to thank you, Mr. President. Most of this gasoline, we are producing it in the Pemex refinery that you’ve allowed us to buy in Deer Park, Texas. We are putting at the disposal, or setting at the disposal, of your administration over 1000 kilometers of gas pipelines, throughout the southern border with Mexico, to transport gas from Texas to New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your patience of sitting out here. I appreciate it. Please have a seat, if you have one.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (00:11)', 'Speech': 'Hello, Massachusetts. It’s an honor to be with your outstanding members of Congress today. Senator Ed Markey, Ed? There you go. Senator Elizabeth Warren. Congressman Jake Auchincloss. Where is he? There you go, Jake. Bill Keating, Congressman. And your great former members, and one of my dearest friends, John Kerry’s doing a great job leading our international Special Presidential Envoy on Climate, traveling the world and talking with an awful lot of people. He’s talking into moving more than they’ve been doing. And another great Massachusetts native Gina McCarthy, Gina. There she is. My National Climate Advisor is leading our climate efforts here at home. It’s an honor to be joined by your neighbor from Rhode Island. He’s not a bad guy at all. I live in his house, Sheldon Whitehouse, a great champion, a great champion in the environment. He’d been banging away. I come here today with a message. As President and I have a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve when our nation faces clear and present danger.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (01:31)', 'Speech': 'And that’s what climate change is about. It is literally, not figuratively, a clear and present danger. The health of our citizens in our communities is literally at stake. The UN’s leading international climate scientists call the latest climate report nothing less than “code red for humanity”. Let me say it again. Code red for humanity. This is not a group of political officials, elected officials. These are the scientists. We see it here in America, in red states and blue states, extreme weather events costing $145 billion, $145 billion in damages just last year. More powerful and destructive hurricanes and tornadoes. I’ve flown over the vast majority of them out west and down in Louisiana, all across America. It’s amazing to see. Ravaging, hundred year old droughts occurring every few years, instead of every hundred years. Wildfires out west that have burned and destroyed more than five million acres. Everything in its path. That is more land than the entire state of New Jersey, from New York down to the tip of Delaware.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (02:43)', 'Speech': 'It’s amazing. five million acres. Our national security is at stake as well. Extreme weather is already damaging our military installations here in the States and our economy is at risk. So we have to act. Extreme weather disrupts supply chains, causing delays and shortages for consumers and businesses. Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world. So my message today is this, since Congress is not acting as it should, and these guys here are, but we’re not getting many Republican votes. This is an emergency, an emergency. And I will, I will look at it that way. I said last week, and I’ll say it again, loud and clear, as President I’ll use my executive powers to combat the climate crisis in the absence of Congressional action, not withstanding their incredible action.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:36)', 'Speech': 'In the coming days, my administration will announce the executive actions we have developed to combat this emergency. We need to act. We just take a look around. Right now, 100 million Americans are under a heat alert, 100 million Americans. 90 communities across America set records for high temperatures just this year, including here in New England, as we speak. And by the way, records have been set in the Arctic and the Antarctic, temperatures that are just unbelievable. Melting the permafrost. It’s astounding, the damage that’s being done, and this crisis impacts every aspect of our everyday life. That’s why today I’m making the largest investment ever. $2.3 billion to help communities across the country build infrastructure that’s designed to withstand the full range of disasters we’ve been seing up to today. Extreme heat, drought, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes. Right now, there are millions of people suffering from extreme heat at home.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (04:41)', 'Speech': 'So my team is also working with the States to deploy $385 million right now for. The first time, States will be able to use federal funds to pay for air conditioners in homes, set up community cooling centers in schools where people can get through these extreme heat crises. And I mean, people and crises that are a hundred to 117 degrees. An infrastructure law that you’re members of Congress have delivered includes $3.1 billion to weatherize homes and make them more energy efficient, which will lower energy cost while keeping America cool in the summer and warm in the winter and not using too much energy. And my Department of Labor led by a guy named Marty Walsh. He talks funny. He’s a hell of a guy, but all kidding aside, Marty was a great mayor. And I know he knows how to get a job done, and he’s doing two things for me.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:36)', 'Speech': 'First of all, sa Secretary of Labor, he’s developing the first ever workplace standards for extreme heat saying under these conditions to hit this, you cannot do the following. You cannot ask people to do certainly. Second. He’s sending folks out from the Labor Department to make sure we hold workplaces to those standards that are being set. They’ve already completed over 500 heat related inspections of workplaces across 43 states. And the end of the day, it’s going to save lives.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:07)', 'Speech': 'Now let me tell you why we’re here at Brayton Point. Five years ago, this towering power plant that once stood with cooling towers 500 feet high closed down. The coal plant at Brayton Point was the largest of its kind in New England. 1,500 megawatts of power, enough to power one in five Massachusetts homes and businesses. For over 50 years, this plant supported this regions economy through the electricity they supplied, the good jobs they provided, and the local taxes they paid.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:43)', 'Speech': 'But the plant, like many others around the country, had another legacy. One of toxins, smog, greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of pollution that contributed to the climate emergency we now face today. Gina McCarthy, a former regulator in Massachusetts was telling me on the way up how folks used to get a rag out and wipe the gunk off of their car’s windshields in the morning just to be able to drive. Not very much unlike where I grew up in a place called Claymont, Delaware, which has more oil refineries than Houston, Texas had in its region, just across the line in Pennsylvania. And all the prevailing winds were our way. I just lived up the road. Just an apartment complex when we moved to Delaware. And just up the road a little school I went to, Holy Rosary Grade School. And because it was a four lane highway that was accessible, my mother drove us rather than us able to walk.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:40)', 'Speech': 'And guess what? The first frost you knew what was happening. You had to put on your windshield wipers to get literally the oil slick off the window. That’s why I, and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer. And why for the longest time Delaware had the highest cancer rate in the nation. But that’s the past. And we’re going to build a different future. One with clean energy, good paying jobs. Just 15 years ago, America generated more than half its electricity from coal, coal-fired plants. Today that’s down to 20% because there’s a big transition happening. Many of these fossil fuel plants are becoming sites for new clean energy construction. Others are switching to new clean technologies. Look at Brayton Point. Today, Brayton is one of the frontiers on the frontier of clean energy in America. On this site, they’ll manufacture 248 miles of high tech heavy duty cables. Those specialized subsea cables are necessary to tie offshore wind farms to the existing grid. Manufacturing these cables will mean good paying jobs for 250 workers, as many workers as the old power plant had it as peak.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:59)', 'Speech': 'And the port, the port here, 34 feet deep, was used to carry coal into the power plant. Now we’re going to use that same port to carry components for wind power into the sea. The converter station here, and the substation nearby are the assets that move energy across the power lines. They’ll now move clean electricity generated offshore by the wind. Enough power to power hundreds of thousands of homes onto the grid, putting old assets to work delivering clean energy. This didn’t happen by accident. It happened because we believed and invested in America’s innovation and ingenuity. One of the companies investing in the factory here joined me at the White House this month. Vineyard Winds, whose CEO told me about the groundbreaking project labor agreements they’ve negotiated will create good paying union jobs. And I want to compliment Congressman Bill Keating for his work in this area. I’m also proud to point out that my administration approved the first commercial project for offshore wind in America, which is being constructed by Vineyard Winds.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:12)', 'Speech': 'Folks, elsewhere in the country, we are propelling retrofits and ensuring that even where a fossil fuel plant retires, they still have a role in powering the future. In Illinois, for example, the State has launched a broad effort to invest in converting old power plants to solar farms, led by Governor Pritzker. In California, the IEBW members have helped turn a former oil plant into the world’s largest battery storage facility. The world’s largest facility. In Wyoming, innovators have chosen a retiring plant as the next site for the next generation nuclear plant. And my administration is a partner in that progress, driving federal resources and funding to the communities that have powered this country for generations. And that’s why they need to be taken care of as well. I want to thank Cecil Roberts, a friend and President of United Mine Workers of America, and so many other labor leaders who we worked with on these initiatives.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:11)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, we’ve invested more than $4 billion in federal funding to the 25 hardest hit coal communities in the country from West Virginia to Kentucky, to Wyoming, to New Mexico. Through the infrastructure law, we’re investing in clean hydrogen, nuclear and carbon capture with the largest grid investments in American history. We’ve secured $16 billion to clean up abandoned minds and wells protecting thousands of communities from toxins and waste, particularly methane. And we’re going to seal leaking methane pollution, an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas that’s 40 times more dangerous to the environment than carbon dioxide. And folks, with American leadership back on climate, I was able to bring more world leaders together than… We got a hundred nations together to agree at the major conference in Glasgow, Scotland, to change the emissions policies we have. We’ve made real progress, but there’s an enormous task ahead.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:21)', 'Speech': 'We have to keep retaining and recruiting, building trades and union electricians for jobs in wind, solar, hydrogen, and nuclear, creating even more and better jobs. We have to revitalize communities, especially those fence line communities that are smothered by the legacy of pollution. We have to outcompete China in the world and make these technologies here in the United States, not have to import them. Folks, when I think about climate change, and I’ve been saying this for three years, I think jobs. Climate change, I think jobs. Almost 100 wind turbines going up off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island with ground broken and work underway. Jobs manufacturing 2,500 ton steel foundations that anchor these offshore wind farms to the sea floor. Jobs manufacturing a Jones Act vessel in Texas to service these offshore wind farms.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:25)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to make sure that the ocean is open for the clean energy of our future and everything we can do to give a green light to wind power on the Atlantic coast where my predecessor’s actions only created confusion. And today we began the process to develop wind power in the Gulf of Mexico as well, for the first time. A real opportunity to power millions of additional homes from wind. Let’s clear the way. Let’s clear the way for clean energy and connect these projects to the grid. I’ve directed my administration to clear every federal hurdle and streamline federal permitting that brings these clean energy projects online right now and right away. And some of you have already come up and talked to me about that.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:12)', 'Speech': 'And while so many governors and mayors have been strong partners in this fight to tackle climate change, we need all governors and mayors. We need public utility commissioners and state agency heads. We need electric utilities and developers to stand up and be part of the solution. Don’t be a roadblock. You all have a duty right now to our economy, to our competitiveness in the world, to the young people in this nation and to future generations, that sounds like hyperbole, but it’s not, it’s real, to act boldly on climate. And so does Congress, which, not withstanding the leadership of the men and women that are here today, has failed in this duty. Not a single Republican in Congress stepped up to support my climate plan, not one. So let me be clear. Climate change is an emergency and in the coming weeks, I’m going to use the power I have as President to turn these words into formal official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that a President possesses.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:23)', 'Speech': 'When it comes to fighting climate change, I will not take no for an answer. I will do everything in my power to clean our air and water, protect our people’s health, to win the clean energy future. This again, sounds like hyperbole, but our children and grandchildren are counting on us. Not a joke, not a joke. If we don’t keep it below 1.5 degree centigrade, we lose it all. We don’t get to turn it around. And the world is counting on us. And this is the United States of America. When we put our hearts and minds to it, there’s not a single thing beyond our capacity. I mean it, when we act together, and of all things we should be acting together on, it’s climate. It’s climate. And by the way, my dear mother, God rest her soul, she’d say Joey out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:22)', 'Speech': 'Look what’s happening. We’re going to be able to create as many or more good paying jobs. We’re going to make environments where people live safer. We’re going to make the air safer. I really mean it. We have an opportunity here. I’ll bet you, when you see what’s happened here in this cable construction here, manufacturing, you go back and ask all the people who grew up in this beautiful place what they’d rather have. They want the plant back? With everything it had? Or what you’re going to have. I will be dumbfounded if you find anybody other than for pure sentimental reasons saying I’d rather have a coal plant.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (17:03)', 'Speech': 'I’ll end by telling you another quick story. When we moved from Scranton, when coal died in Scranton, everything died in Scranton. And my dad wasn’t a coal miner. My great grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad was in sales and there was no work. So we left to go down to Delaware. I told you where those oil plants were, but I remember driving home, when you take the trolley in Scranton, going out North Washington and Adams Avenues, within 15 blocks, we didn’t live in the neighborhood, among the most prestigious neighborhood in the region, in the town where the Scranton’s and other good decent people live, there was a, you’d go by a wall that my recollection is, was somewhere between 15 and 18 feet tall. And it went for essentially a city block. And you could see the coal piled up to the very top of the wall from inside. It was a coal fired plant, a coal fired plant, and all of the negative impacts of breathing that coal, the dust, affecting everybody. But at the time, people didn’t know it and there wasn’t any alternative.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:30)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we have no excuse now. We know it. There are answers for it. We can make things better in terms of jobs, we can make things better in terms of the environment. We can make things better for families overall. So I’m looking forward to this movement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

You’ve been with me from the beginning and I’ve been with you and thank you. Thank you to the more than 3,000 members of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives for your service and your sacrifice and those of your families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:18)', 'Speech': 'I wish I could be there with you in person to thank you and to congratulate Cedric Richmond on receiving your leadership award. He’s a good man. What I’ve admired most about Cedric is his character and moral clarity. Never letting us forget that for too many Americans, justice and fairness and economic opportunity are still just empty promises that need to be fulfilled. So Cedric, thanks. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (00:44)', 'Speech': 'Just over two months ago, a hate filled white supremacist drove seven hours to a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. Armed with weapons of war and high quality body armor, he came to kill as many Black people as he could. 10 people died that day, including Aaron Salter, a security guard on duty and was also retired Buffalo police officer, having served for 30 years in that capacity. He confronted the killer. His bullets though, couldn’t pierce the shooter’s armor and his gun was no match for the shooter’s AR-15.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:21)', 'Speech': 'Jill and I traveled to Buffalo to meet with all the families and the victims, including Aaron’s widow. When I think of Aaron’s story and that of his family, I think of all of you. Being a police officer isn’t just what you do, it’s who you are. And it’s never easy. Every day you put the shield on and you walk out the door and your family worries about receiving that phone call. Being a cop today is a hell of a lot harder than it’s ever been.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (01:53)', 'Speech': 'We expect everything of you. We expect you to be drug counselors to people overdosing at a scene; therapist to couples during a violent confrontation; social workers to kids who have been abandoned; and maybe worse of all, we send you out to do your job on the streets flooded with weapons of war. You hear a lot of politicians about how much they love you, how much they care about you, how they’ll do anything for you. In the state you’re in today, Governor DeSantis, Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Rick Scott, all opposed banning assault weapons. And Senator Scott and Rubio voted against the bipartisan gun safety law that I signed, the first meaningful gun legislation in nearly 30 years that you supported. To me, it’s simple. If you can’t support banning weapons of war on American streets, you’re not on the side of police.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (02:50)', 'Speech': 'Years ago, with your help I led and won the fight to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines in this country. I’m determined to do it again. On the ballot this year will be whether or not this nation bans assault weapons. I own guns. I own two shotguns. I believe in the second amendment. But it’s not a right that’s absolute. Even the very conservative justice Scalia wrote, and I quote, “Like most rights, the right granted by the second amendment are not unlimited.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (03:22)', 'Speech': 'When it comes to assault weapons, too many politicians are bowing down to the NRA. I believe that we should protect you, protect you. And I’ll keep saying it. When it comes to public safety, the answer isn’t to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police, fund the police. That’s why when I wrote the American Rescue Plan, I provided historic $350 billion directly to cities, counties, states and tribes that were struggling with budget shortfalls as a result of the pandemic and the economic crisis we found ourselves in. That could be used a lot of that money to be used to keep essential workers and essential services going, including keeping teachers in classrooms.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:05)', 'Speech': 'Over $10 billion of that money, of that funding, is being used to keep cops on the job, build new training facilities, enhance gun investigations and prosecutions and violence intervention programs. Look, it’s one of the biggest federal investments in law enforcement and public safety in our history and every single Republican in Congress voted against it knowing that this fund would be used for law enforcement and public safety.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (04:35)', 'Speech': 'On the second anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, I signed with your robust support, one of the most significant police reforms and support orders in decades to ensure effective, accountable and transparent community policing. It applies to 100,000 federal law enforcement officers, but we expect the order to have significant impact on state and local law enforcement agencies as well. It promotes accountability by creating a new national law enforcement database to track records of misconduct. It raises standards by banning choke holds and restricting no knock warrants. And it modernizes policing by calling for a fresh approach to recruit, to train and to promote the best officers who will advance public safety and public trust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (05:27)', 'Speech': 'And that includes building on three laws I signed last November to extend critical mental health protections for officers, expand eligibility and benefits for the first responders disabled in the line of duty. Earlier this month, again with your support, we enacted the most significant gun safety law in near 30 years. The new law provides over $750 million in crisis intervention programs and for red flag laws; requires young people under 21 years of age to undergo enhance background checks before they’re able to buy a gun. This law does so much more. It saves lives, including yours. It’ll help you do your job, but it’s just a start.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:16)', 'Speech': 'Last week, I rolled out my Safer America Plan with a goal of doing three key things. First, take additional common sense steps to reduce gun crimes and violence with the first permanent director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives in seven years. My plan empowers ATF and our agents to stop trafficking in firearms across state lines, to help you trace firearms to solve more crimes. And earlier this year, the US Department of Justice took action to stop the proliferation of so-called ghost guns that you’ve told us about. And they’re increasingly found on crime scenes. My plan calls on Congress to do so much more to keep dangerous guns out of dangerous hands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:04)', 'Speech': 'Second, my Safer America Plan supports you. It’s going to help communities hire more than 100,000 police officers, patterned after successful community policing program I put in place years ago. We’re talking about cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood and who can build trust and safety in the neighborhoods.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:27)', 'Speech': 'And third, my Safer America’s Plan invests in crime prevention. It funds programs to ensure that we respond to non-violent situations with mental health specialists and social workers, not just you alone, but with them alongside you. It funds training and programs to give young people a fair shot and more productive life and keep them out of trouble. Instead of giving formally incarcerated people, for example, 25 bucks and a bus ticket as they leave prison that leads them right back under the bridge they found them when they got arrested.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:05)', 'Speech': 'My plan supports a basic idea: Those who have served their time should qualify not only for Pell grants to earn a degree, but get access to good jobs and training, affordable housing, food and medical benefits. All these steps will reduce crime and prevent crime from happening in the first place. And my Safer America Plan is part of my administration’s relentless efforts to invest and empower Black communities to be architects of their own future. We made record investments of more than $5 billion in historic Black colleges and universities. Deliver relief to working families that cut Black child poverty to historic lows and save millions of families an average of $2,400 a year on health insurance through the ACA, the Affordable Care Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:58)', 'Speech': 'We set the goal of increasing federal contracts to go to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by the year 2025, which could mean an additional $100 billion from minority and women owned businesses. Through my infrastructure law, we’re investing in Black communities with better roads, cleaner water, high speed internet that help families and schools and communities thrive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:24)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. Every day we rely on law enforcement to save lives. Then on January 6th, we relied on law enforcement to save our democracy. We saw what happened. The Capitol police, the DC metropolitan police, other law enforcement agencies were attacked and assaulted before our very eyes, speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized and lives were lost. And for three hours, the defeated former president of the United States watched it all happen as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office. While he was doing that, brave law enforcement officer subject to the medieval hell for three hours, dripping in blood, surrounded by carnage.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:14)', 'Speech': 'Face to face with a crazed mob that believed the lies of a defeated president. The police were heroes that day. Donald Trump lacked the courage to act. The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that. You can’t be pro insurrection and pro cop. You can’t be pro insurrection and pro democracy. You can’t be pro insurrection and pro American. There can be no greater responsibility than to do all we can to ensure the safety of our families, our children, our community, our nation, and our law enforcement officers. I will always meet that duty just as you do every single day as members of a critically important organization.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:04)', 'Speech': 'May God bless you all and may God protect law enforcement. God bless your families.'}]"

He was with him all the whole time. He was his number two man, his deputy at the time the terrorists attack on 9/11. He was deeply involved in the planning of 9/11. One of the most responsible for the attacks that murdered 2,977 people on American soil.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:38)', 'Speech': 'For decades, he was a mastermind behind attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more. He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:01)', 'Speech': 'He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats, and American interests. And since the United States delivered justice to bin Laden 11 years ago, Zawahiri has been a leader of Al Qaeda, the leader.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:20)', 'Speech': 'From hiding, he coordinated Al-Qaeda’s branches and all around the world, including setting priorities for providing operational guidance that called for and inspired attacks against US targets. He made videos, including in recent weeks calling for his followers to attack the United States and our allies.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:39)', 'Speech': 'Now, justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:01)', 'Speech': 'We make it clear again tonight that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:15)', 'Speech': 'After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under President’s Bush, Obama, and Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year. He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:30)', 'Speech': 'After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This mission was carefully planned and rigorously minimized the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised that the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him, and the mission was a success. None of his family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:03)', 'Speech': 'I’m sharing this news with the American people now after confirming the mission’s total success through the painstaking work of our counter-terrorism community and key allies and partners. My administration has kept congressional leaders informed as well.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:20)', 'Speech': 'When I ended our military mission in Afghanistan almost a year ago, I made the decision that after 20 years of war, the United States no longer needed thousands of boots on the ground in Afghanistan to protect America from terrorists who seek to do us harm. And I made a promise to the American people that we continue to conduct effective counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan and beyond. We’ve done just that.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:45)', 'Speech': 'In February, our forces conducted a daring mission in Syria that eliminated the Emir of ISIS. Last month, we took out another key ISIS leader. Now we have eliminated the Emir of Al-Qaeda. He will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone and we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens. It can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re going to see to it that won’t happen.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:17)', 'Speech': 'This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can, and will always make good on the solemn pledge. My administration will continue to vigilantly monitor and address threats from Al-Qaeda, no matter where they emanate from.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:34)', 'Speech': 'As commander-in-chief, it is my solemn responsibility to make America safe in a dangerous world. The United States did not seek this war against terror. It came to us and we answered with the same principles and resolve that have shaped us for generation upon generation. To protect the innocent, defend liberty, and we keep the light of freedom burning, a beacon for the rest of the entire world. Because this is a great and defining truth about our nation and our people, we do not break. We never give in. We never back down.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:11)', 'Speech': 'Last year on September 11th, I once more paid my respect to Ground Zero in New York City at that quiet field in Shanksville, and at the Pentagon. Standing in the Memorial at Ground Zero, seeing the names of those who died forever etched in bronze is a powerful reminder of the sacred promise we made as a nation. We will never forget.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:36)', 'Speech': 'The memorial also bears the quotation from Virgil. “No day shall erase you from the memory of time. No day shall erase you from the memory of time.” So we continue to mourn every innocent life that was stolen on 9/11 and honor their memories.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:53)', 'Speech': 'To the families who lost fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, friends and coworkers, on that searing September day, it is my hope that this decisive action will bring one more measure of closure. “No day shall erase them from the memory of time.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:13)', 'Speech': 'Today and every day, I’m so grateful for the superb patriots who serve the United States intelligence community and counter-terrorism communities. They never forget. And those dedicated women and men who tireless work every single day to keep our country safe to prevent future tragedies, it is thanks to their extraordinary persistence and skill that this operation was a success. They made us all safer.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:43)', 'Speech': 'And to those around the world who continue to seek to harm the United States, hear me now. We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:59)', 'Speech': 'Today, we remember the lost, we commit ourselves to the safety of the living, and we pledge that we shall never waiver from defending our nation as people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:10)', 'Speech': 'Thank you all, and may God protect our troops and all those who serve in harm’s way.

https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-remarks-on-his-safer-america-plan-transcript,2022-08-31,President Biden Delivers Remarks on his Safer America Plan Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Paige Cognetti: (00:00)', 'Speech': 'Can we get a big welcome home, Mr. President? It is so wonderful to be here with all of you. We were thinking, “President’s coming. What can we do to make this day special?” So at our recent popup city halls, we had coloring sheets for kids and we asked them the question, “Why do you love Scranton?” And so many of them said the people. Lovely people, people who help each other, this community has each other’s backs. And we know that our president Joe Biden knows this. It is part of his DNA. And we see it in all of the incredible legislation that he has put through as president of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Paige Cognetti: (00:52)', 'Speech': 'Today, we’re here to talk about the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to give us the resources and cities like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre throughout Northeastern, Pennsylvania, and this whole Commonwealth to fight violence, to prevent violence, to interrupt violence, to make our kids safer, to help our schools be safer. And the president knows how important this is because he is from here, because he knows that we have to have each other’s backs as a community if we’re going to thrive. It is an honor for us to be here today to welcome him home to celebrate this landmark legislation, and I want to introduce someone that I have worked with across the aisle of Luzerne and Lackawanna counties since day one when we took office just two years ago, and that’s Wilkes-Barre mayor, mayor George Brown.'}, {'Time': 'George Brown: (01:43)', 'Speech': 'How do I upbeat mayor Paige Cognetti? I don’t think I can, but I’m going to try. Folks, go ahead, have a seat please. Down. Yes, we are here today and Joe Biden is here today, and Joe Biden is here for us because he cares about Wilkes-Berry, Luzerne county ,and all the residents in the state of Pennsylvania. As mayor, on behalf of the residents of the city of Wilkes-Berry, I’m honored to welcome president Joe Biden. I first met president Biden in his hometown of Scranton last October, and I said, “Mr. President, please, come to Wilkes-Barre. We have a beautiful city.” And guess what? He kept his promise. He’s here today.'}, {'Time': 'George Brown: (03:11)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank the members of the Biden Harris administration for making this visit possible. I truly believe that president Biden’s childhood in Northeastern Pennsylvania was the foundation for his history of leadership and rise to commander in chief. The citizens of Northeastern Pennsylvania are resilient and they truly care about their neighbors, much like president Joe Biden. Mr. Biden has stood up for the American people through the implementation of the American Rescue Plan, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the Inflation Reduction Act. These initiatives are investments that make our community stronger, healthier, and safer. By implementing multiple programs through the American Rescue Plan funds, my administration was able to financially assist residents, businesses, and nonprofits most impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. With the focus on public safety, we were able to utilize the plan funds to enhance public safety for residents, businesses, and owners of businesses throughout the entire community.'}, {'Time': 'George Brown: (04:25)', 'Speech': 'Now the American Rescue Plan funds have allowed our police to obtain updated equipment to serve and protect the city of Wilkes-Barre. We’re able to purchase 10 new police cars. We’re buying 10 bicycles so our police will be on bicycles in the neighborhoods, pure community policing. And we’ve also purchased other visibility intel that we’re going to be using. Things like body cameras that we have now on all of our officers, but also we’re going to be increasing the technology by purchasing a gunshot detection technology throughout the city of Wilkes-Barre. This is all done as a result of president Biden’s efforts. We welcome the president’s initiatives through the Safer America Plan. We will promote a safer community by ensuring that our police department always has the most updated equipment and training. In closing, I’m appreciative of president Biden’s visit to Wilkes-Barre today, and even more so the long lasting benefits of the American rescue plan and the path towards a safer Wilkes-Barre through his Safer America Plan. Now it’s my honor to introduce to you president Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (06:26)', 'Speech': 'Mr. Mayor, thank you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Before you walk down, I want the Caseys to come up with me because where I come from, Scranton’s Casey country. We got raised in the same neighborhood in Greenridge, not far from two of the best little candy shops in the whole country. And I just wanted to let… They can’t deny me, that’s why I wanted them up here. I want them to know. And by the way, this guy has more integrity in his little finger than most people have in their whole body. That’s why I love working with him.'}, {'Time': 'Bobby Casey: (07:06)', 'Speech': 'Welcome home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (07:09)', 'Speech': 'And like me, he married way up. Way up. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. As my mother, Jean Finnegan Biden from Greenridge would say, ” Please, excuse my back when I’m speaking. I apologize.” And by the way, you know one of the best things of all of being president of United States is the Marine Band. They’re the best in the world. Stand up guys. They are the very, very, very, very best. They cannot only play, they know how to fight too. God love you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. Well thank you very much. Thank you. How are you, baby? How old are you? How old are you? Almost double figures. Well look, folks, it’s great to be here in Wilkes-Barre. I mean that sincerely.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (08:20)', 'Speech': 'Well, thank you. Well thank you so much. Mayor Brown, thank you for the introduction and the passport to this great city, and mayor Cognetti, we’re almost in heaven. We’re almost in Scranton. Almost. Being raised in Scranton, I used to say you’re going down the line, any rate, and what a leadership lineup you have here in Pennsylvania. I want to thank your outstanding governor, Tom Wolf. Tom and I have been friends a long time. He’s truly one of the best governors in the United States of America. Not a joke. Not a joke. And a stand up guy. A stand up guy. And Josh Shapiro is a champion for the rule of law as your attorney general, and he is going to make one hell of a governor. I really mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:14)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, he couldn’t be here today, we spoke, lieutenant governor, John Fetterman. When I say he is a powerful voice… I used to be in the old days, a pretty good athlete, and if someone was really big and tough, you say, “I wouldn’t screw with him if I had a sledgehammer.” Well, I’d tell you what, Fetterman’s a hell of a guy. A powerful voice for working people, and he’s going to make your great United States Senator. You’re going to make your great United States Senator.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (09:43)', 'Speech': 'And as I said, Bobby Casey’s one of my closest friends, one of our great United States senators. And your Congressman, Matt Cartwright is the real reason I’m here. I’m in Cartwright country. He knows how to deliver for this district, which is so close to my heart. Look, I especially want to thank all the members of law enforcement are here, many of whom are behind me, for always being there for us. And we should always be there from them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (10:14)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, also a group that you need badly, you don’t really appreciate until you need them, is the firefighters. The firefighters been with me my whole career. And let me tell you something, there’s an old expression. God made man. Then he made a few firefighters, because you got to be crazy to be a firefighter. By the way, please sit down. I’m sorry. Please sit down. I keep forgetting. Thank you. But look, when I ran for president, I said I looked at the world the way I looked at it growing up in Scranton, and that wasn’t hyperbole. I meant that. What families wanted in Scranton when I was growing up, my mom and dad and my grandpop was the basic basic as it is today. A decent-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': '… The basic, basic, basic as it is today, a decent job, the opportunity to be treated with dignity, everyone. My dad would say everybody, everybody’s entitled to be treated with dignity, just simple dignity. The fact is that they want to be able to go to good schools in safe neighborhoods, a decent place to live, and just a fair shot, just a fair shot for their kids. A peace of mind knowing your kids can go to school or the playground or the movies or a high school game and come home safely, not have to think about it. But for too long, too many families haven’t had that peace of mind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (11:41)', 'Speech': 'They watch the news and they see kids being gunned down in schools and on the streets. Almost every single night, you turn the news on that’s what you see. They see their neighbors lose their loved ones to drugs like fentanyl, which is a flat killer. They see hate and anger and violence just walking the streets of America and they just want to feel safe again. They want to feel a sense of security. And that’s what my crime plan is all about. I call it to Safer America’s Plan and both your members of Congress voted for it. It’s based on a simple notion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (12:19)', 'Speech': 'When it comes to public safety in this nation, the answer is not defund the police. It’s fund the police. Fund the police and give them … We expect them to do everything. We expect them to protect us, to be psychologists and to be sociology. I mean, we expect you to do everything. I’m not joking. Everything. You realize more police officers are killed dealing with domestic violence than anything else. Do you realize that? The point is we ask so much of you, so much of you. I’ve not met a cop who likes a bad cop. There’s bad in everything.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:07)', 'Speech': 'There’s lousy senators. There’s lousy presidents. There’s lousy doctors. There’s lousy lawyers. No, I’m serious. But I don’t know any police officer that feels good about the fact that there may be a lousy cop. And I’m tired of not giving the kind of help they need. Folks, look, we’re in a situation in this country where we have to give them additional resources they need to get their job done. Matt gets it, Matt Cartwright. And this is not hyperbole. Matt’s the chair of the powerful subcommittee that controls the funding for public safety.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (13:45)', 'Speech': 'He knows what it means investing in effective and accountable community policing that builds public structures, trenches, public safety. I’m old enough to remember when cops used to walk the beat in Wilmington and in Scranton because they knew everybody. They knew the kid. They knew something was trouble. They knew whose house to go and knock on the door and say, mom, your son just did. I’m not being facetious. They knew the neighborhoods. As part of the American Rescue Plan I signed in the law last year, which they voted for, we set aside 350 billion with a B, billion dollars for state and local governments all across America and urged them to use it like your governor did, to make communities safer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (14:32)', 'Speech': 'Here in Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf was using $250 million of that money to reduce crime and violence across this state. And Mayor Brown just described how it’s helping fund community policing here in Wilkes-Barre. But guess what? Every single Republican member of Congress, every single one in this state, every single one voted against a support for law enforcement. They talk about how much they love it. They voted against the funding. Flat out. Flat out. Every Republican in the House, every Republican in the Senate, every single one.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (15:19)', 'Speech': 'I know we expect so much from our law enforcement officers, so we need to support them. That’s why my crime plan to help communities recruit, hire and train nationwide more than 100,000 additional officers, accountable officers for community policing. And I mean it. Folks, when it comes to fighting crime, we know it works. Officers on the street who know the neighborhood, not a joke, who know the neighborhood, who know where the families are protecting, who get to training they need to be able to do their jobs well, who work to earn the community’s trust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:05)', 'Speech': 'And as we hire more police officers, there should be more training, more help and more accountability. Without public trust, law enforcement can’t do its job serving and protecting all the communities. If I can just interject for a moment, my deceased son Beau, he was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And what he used to do is go down in the east side, called The Bucket, highest crime rate in the country. It is a place where I was the only white guy that worked as a lifeguard down in that area in the east side.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (16:38)', 'Speech': 'And you could always tell where the best basketball in the state is and the best basketball in the city is. It’s where everybody shows up. He’d go down and hang out and sit on a bench with my grandson, who’s now 17-years-old and the police used to be in the car, local city police. And he’d walk up and bang on the window, say get out of the car dammit and meet these people. Let them see you. Let them know you. Let them know who you are. Well, the truth was, remember what happened to community policing? We went from having enough cops on the street to cities doing well and then deciding they don’t need more police officers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:16)', 'Speech': 'So they reduced the police forces. So you didn’t have two cops in every vehicle. You had one cop in every vehicle. And I don’t blame one cop for not getting out in some certain neighborhoods, not getting out of the car. And what happens is it used to be. I can remember that when my son was the attorney general, he’d go around in the tougher neighborhoods and he would ensure that every single cop gave his cell phone number to the local liquor store owner, the local church, the local grocery store, the local hamburger joint. So if there’s a problem, they pick up the phone and call.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (17:51)', 'Speech': 'Because what do people not want to do in tough neighborhoods? They don’t want to be the one identified as turning so and so in. I remember going on the east side in Wilmington and one of those old Victorian three story apartment buildings and going up to see woman’s whose name, she’s passed away, but won’t mention her name now and standing in that rotund, that part that stuck out around the building. And she’d say, Joey, I know I what’s going on. They all plant it downstairs. I can hear them, but I’m afraid to tell anybody. Afraid to tell anybody, the gangs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (18:29)', 'Speech': 'And so I got her so that I got a phone number for the local cops. She’d call. They promised not to identify her because they knew there’d be retribution. And the crime rate began to drop for real, not a joke. You got to know people. You got to know and you got to be able to trust the police. The police have to be able to trust the community, but we slipped away from that. We have a hell of a lot fewer cops today than we did when I wrote that initial crime bill. But now we got to get back to it. And by the way, I’m not making the case there aren’t bad cops.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:01)', 'Speech': 'There’s some really lousy cops. There’s some really lousy doctors. There’s some really lousy lawyers, I mean it. But here’s the point, as we’ve seen too often, public trust is frayed and is broken and it undermines public safety when it gets frayed. It literally undermines safety. Families across the country have to ask why in this nation, for example, so many Black Americans wake up knowing they could lose their life just by living their lives. If you come from neighborhoods like I come from down in Delaware, if you have a 16 or 17-year-old son and he gets a driver’s license, you sit down and say, look, if you get stopped, put your hands in the wheel.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (19:42)', 'Speech': 'Don’t do anything. I mean, I’m being serious. I’m being serious. But here’s the point, simply jogging, sleeping in their homes. They made headlines or not. They have a lot of lost souls. Increased trust makes policing more effective and it strengthens public safety. And the communities, by the way, that want the police more than any other community are the tough, poor communities, Black, white, immigrants. They need the help. They want the help. It’s not they don’t want it. They want the help. Without that, victims don’t call for help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (20:26)', 'Speech': 'Witnesses don’t step forward. Crimes go unsolved. Justice isn’t served. I took executive action, which I’m allowed to do as president. I always admired governors can take executive action, but all kidding aside, to make some of these reforms for federal officers. I couldn’t do it for state officers. One, no federal officer is allowed to use a chokehold. No federal officer can restrict … There’s restricted no knock warrants. We created a national database for officers who have misbehaved and been held accountable, so they can’t hide.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:02)', 'Speech': 'My plan will help make sure that state and local governments adopt these same reforms. My plan does something else really important. It addresses the opioid epidemic. You realize how many people are dying of opioid overdoses now, and by the way, lace with fentanyl? Attorney General Shapiro can tell you more about that you never want to know for a fact, for real. He’s been such a strong leader on this, but we’re going to impose tougher penalties for deadly fentanyl trafficking that’s poisoning communities across this country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (21:34)', 'Speech': 'This is a key part of the unity agenda that I announced in my State of the Union Address. We can do this. We have to do this. We’ll make America safer. My plan also takes common sense action to reduce gun violence and violence overall. The bills and the progress we made this summer when I signed in the law the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law we passed in 30 years. It took 30 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (22:02)', 'Speech': '30 years, took 30 years and we beat the NRA. We took them on and we beat the NRA straight up. You have no idea how intimidating they are to elected officials. The NRA was against it, which means the vast majority, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress couldn’t even stand up and vote for it because they’re afraid of the NRA. It’s not unusual, every Democrats, Republican senators, they get afraid of certain interest groups. They voted against it. Law enforcement supported it, faith leaders and teachers supported it, victims of gun violence and their family supported it, young people in this country, like the students of this great university, supported it, and the NRA and the vast majority of congressional [inaudible 00:22:57] voted against it, saving lives and keeping America safe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (23:00)', 'Speech': 'But guess what? We took on the NRA and we’re going to take them on again and we won, and we will win again. But we’re not stopping here, I’m determined to ban assault weapons in this country, determined. I did it once before and I’ll do it again. For many of you home, I want to be clear, it’s not about taking away anybody’s guns, in fact, we should be treating responsible gun owners as examples of how every gun owner should behave. I have two shotguns at home, it’s a long store, but I’m not opposed to guns, but I support the Second Amendment and I support the Second Amendment. But the Second Amendment, as one of the most conservative justice in history, Justice Scalia, once wrote, “Like most rights, the rights granted by the Second Amendment are not unlimited.” They’re not unlimited.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:06)', 'Speech': 'Right now you can’t go out and buy an automatic weapon, you can’t go out and buy a cannon, and for those brave right-wing Americans who say, “It’s all about shaping America or keeping America’s independent and safe, if you want to fight against a country, you need a F-15, you need something a little more than a gun.” No, I’m not joking. Think about this, think about the rationale we use that’s used to provide this and who are they shooting at? Shooting at these guys behind me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (24:38)', 'Speech': 'Folks look, I went to every major school shooting in the country, since I was a chairman of the Judiciary Committee, all the way through as vice president and president. Over 48,000 people died from gunshot wounds in 2021 in the United States of America. Over 26,000 by suicide. When guns are the number one killer, listen to this now, the guns are the number one killer of children in America, of children and number one. More children die from guns than active duty police and active duty military personnel combined. Hear that again. More children in America die from guns than active duty police and active duty military in the United States combined.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (25:34)', 'Speech': 'We have to act. We have to act for those families in Buffalo, Uvalde, New Town, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando, I’ve been to every one of those sites, sit down with those parents, and I spent four hours last time, met with every single one of the parents and families that lost someone, see the looks in their faces. Think about it, think about the devastation that’s occurred. We have to act for all those kids gunned down on our streets every single day that never make the news. There’s a mass shooting every single day in this country, in the streets of America, every single day. You have to act so our kids can learn to read in school instead of learning to duck and cover. Literally, schools all across America, kids are showing up… The psychological damage done to our kids, not just COVID, but COVID what it’s impact and how it’s impacted us, and on top of that, a child going to school, children see this on television.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (26:48)', 'Speech': 'We’re living in a country awash with weapons of war, weapons that weren’t designed to hunt, were designed to take on an enemy, that’s what they were designed to do. For God sake, what’s the rationale for these weapons outside of a war zone? They inflict severe damage. When I was recently in Uvalde, I almost hesitate to say to some of the kids in here, you know what some of the parents had to do? Supply DNA. Supply DNA because the AR-15 just rips the body apart, could not identify the body.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (27:37)', 'Speech': 'A 20-year-old kid can walk in and buy one. DNA to say, “That’s my baby.” What the hell’s the matter with us? No, I’m not joking. Think about it. What are we doing? And by the way, my dad used to love to hunt in the Poconos when we lived in Scranton, how many deer or bear are wearing Kevlar vests? Huh? Not a joke. Do you realize the bullet out of an AR-15 travels five times as rapidly as a bullet shot out of any other gun, five times as lighter and can pierce Kevlar. Imagine being a parent, not just losing a child, but not being able to physically identify the child or the adult because they’ve literally been blown apart.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (28:52)', 'Speech': 'We equip our service members with the most lethal weapons on Earth to protect all of us, protect Americans. But we require them to receive significant training, extensive background checks, mental health assessments, they have to learn how to lock up and store their weapons responsibly or they get kicked out, but we let any stranger, an 18-year-old, walk in, a 20-year-old, and buy an AR-15. That’s why back in 1994, I took on the NRA and passed the Assault Weapons Ban. For 10 years, mass shootings were down, 10 years in a row since I passed that legislation in 1994 as a senator. But in 2004, Republicans let that ban expire. What happened? Mass shootings in America, tripled, tripled. It’s time to ban these, it’s time to ban these weapons. We did it before and we can do it again. Folks, it’s time to hold every elected official’s feet to the fire and ask them, “Are you for banning assault weapons, yes or no?” Ask them. If the answer’s no, vote against them. Look, I’m prouder that after seven years we finally have a senate confirmed director of alcohol, tobacco and firearms, responsible for any gun crimes. For seven years the other team would not let us appoint anyone to that job, incredibly important job to help local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, identify the ballistics, a whole range of things, for seven years. We finally got a pass this time out barely. Seven years because they didn’t want anybody in that job. My plan gives the bureau the funding to hire more agents to stop gun trafficking. And by the way, there’s a lot of states that don’t allow you to purchase certain weapons in the state, but just cross the state line and go buy it next door, bring it across the state line. Keep guns out. Mexico, which is causing us real problems, you know what their biggest complaint is? Can’t we stop gun trafficking across the Southern border into Mexico?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (31:45)', 'Speech': 'There are certain gun dealers that are basically… Not gun dealers, they’re wholesalers providing the weapons to anybody who have the money. Folks look, we can help local law enforcement, we can solve more gun crimes if we have someone heading up, which we finally do, this organization that’s designed to track this kind of behavior.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (32:15)', 'Speech': 'Finally, my plan invest in crime prevention programs that help keep young people from getting in trouble in the first place. Under my plan, communities can one, provide afterschool and summer job programs, they get paid for, more access to mental health and drug counseling, more social workers and housing to keep people off the streets instead of when they get out of jail they get $25 and a bus ticket and they end up under the same bridge that they were under before. This will help prevent crime and get young people to pick up paychecks instead of a pistol. The same time we need help people getting out of prison successfully reenter society-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (33:02)', 'Speech': 'It could help people getting out of prison successfully re-enter society, so they don’t get in trouble again. If you served your time, you shouldn’t be deprived of being able to, if you’ve served it, you shouldn’t be deprived to being able to get a Pell grant to go to school. You shouldn’t be able to get a degree. What’s the best thing you can do? Make them productive. They should get access to good jobs where they can earn a decent living. All these steps will prevent crime, not increase it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (33:35)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. A safer America requires all of us to uphold the rule of law, not the rule of any one party or any one person. Let’s be clear. You hear some of my friends in the other team talking about political violence and how it’s necessary. Think about this now. Did any of you think, even as old as I am, you’d ever be in an election where we talk about it’s appropriate to use force, political violence in America. It’s never appropriate. Never, period. Never, never, never. No one should be encouraged to use political violence, none whatsoever.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (34:21)', 'Speech': 'Look, if we’re in a situation where to this day, the MAGA Republicans in Congress defend the mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th, defend them. They all saw it. I don’t care how frustrated you are. When I showed up, one of the things I learned as president, even though I’d been vice president for eight years and done a great deal on the foreign policy for the administration, I showed up at a meeting of the major democracies called the G7. I sat down. It was in England and I sat down for this three day conference and I said, “America’s back.” And Macron, president of France, turned to me and said, “For how long?” For how long? Then made a discussion with Schmidt and all that. I mean, just for how long?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:16)', 'Speech': 'And one of them said to me, “Imagine Joe, if you turned on the television in Washington, DC and saw a mob of 1000 people storming down the hallways of the Parliament, breaking down the doors, trying to overturn an outcome of election and killing several police officers in the meantime. Imagine. Imagine what you’d think.” Think about what the world saw. Not what we saw, what the world saw. Did you ever think in the United States that would happen?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (35:55)', 'Speech': 'What I find even more incredible is the defense of it. Cops attacked and assaulted, speared with flag poles, sprayed with mace, stomped on, dragged, brutalized. Police lost their lives as a result of that day. Police lost their lives. One of the officers said it was worse than anything he had experienced in war in Iraq. So let me say this to my MAGA Republican friends in Congress. Don’t tell me you support law enforcement if you won’t condemn what happened on the 6th. Don’t tell me. Can’t do it. For God’s sake, whose side are you on? Whose side are you on? Look, you’re either on the side of a mob or the side of the police. You can’t be pro law enforcement and pro insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6th patriots. You can’t do it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (37:24)', 'Speech': 'What are we teaching our children? It’s just that simple. But now it’s sickening to see the new attacks in the FBI, threatening life of law enforcement agents and their families for simply carrying out the law and doing their job. Look, I want to say this as clearly as I can, there’s no place in this country, no place for endangering the lives of law enforcement, no place, none, never, period. I’m opposed to defunding the police. I’m also opposed to defunding the FBI. Look, there’s no greater responsibility for government than ensuring the safety of our people. Every parent should be able to know when a kid leaves home to go to school or just walk the street, they’re going to come home safely. We can do this. We have to do this. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And when we are united, there is not a single thing we cannot do. Not a single thing. I mean it. So folks, let’s remember who in God’s name we are. I really mean it. What our values are, what we believe. We the people. That’s how our Constitution starts, or the declaration. We the people. It’s who we are. By the way, no one expects politics to be a patty cake. It sometimes gets mean as hell. But the idea you turn on a television and see senior senators and congressmen saying if such and such happens, there’ll be blood in the street. Where the hell are we?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (39:39)', 'Speech': 'Where’s that common sense?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (39:40)', 'Speech': 'Well, that’s all I’m looking for. And folks, do me a favor. Presumptuous of me to say that. But think about doing me a favor. Please, please elect the Attorney General to the Senate. Elect that big old boy to be governor. And by the way, there are a lot of really … And I mean this. I’m not being solicitous. Remember what used to be the criticism of Biden when I was running? Biden’s too bipartisan. Biden has too many Republican friends. There’s a lot of Republicans I’ve worked with for all the years in the Senate. I got a lot done. We respected each other. When we disagreed, we disagreed on principle. We then went and had lunch together. Not a joke. What in God’s name has happened to that in the United States of America?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden: (40:46)', 'Speech': 'So folks, let’s bring it back. We can do this. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}]"

I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago, with an idea unique among nations, that in America, we’re all created equal.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:09)', 'Speech': 'This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated. This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known with three simple words. We the people. We the people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:32)', 'Speech': 'These two documents and the ideas they embody, equality and democracy, are the rock upon which this nation is built. They are how we became the greatest nation on earth. They are why for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon to the world. But as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:02)', 'Speech': '… and democracy are under assault. We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise, so tonight I’ve come to this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats, and about the incredible future that lies in front of us, if only we choose it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:32)', 'Speech': 'We must never forget. We the people are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago. We the people have burning inside of each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall, a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, civil rights. That sacred flame still burns now, in our time, as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:21)', 'Speech': 'That is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul. But first, we must be honest with each other and with ourselves. Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:51)', 'Speech': 'Now, I want to be very clear, very clear up front. Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans, but there’s no question that the Republican party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:25)', 'Speech': 'These are hard things, but I’m an American president, not a president of red America or blue America, but of all America. And I believe it’s my duty, my duty to level with you, to tell the truth, no matter how difficult, no matter how painful, and here, in my view, is what is true.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:52)', 'Speech': 'MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election, and they’re working right now as I speak, in state after state, to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:21)', 'Speech': 'MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards, backwards to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love. They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:54)', 'Speech': 'They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th, brutally attacking law enforcement, not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger at the throat of our democracy, but they’re looking at them as Patriots, and they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they’re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people. That’s why respected conservatives like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans “a clear and present danger to our democracy”.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:54)', 'Speech': 'But while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy. There are far more Americans, far more Americans, from every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:26)', 'Speech': 'Folks, it is within our power. It’s in our hands, yours and mine, to stop the assault on American democracy. I believe America’s at an inflection point, one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that’s to come after, and now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards, to build a future or obsess about the past, to be a nation of hope and unity and optimism or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:08)', 'Speech': 'MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth, but in the shadow of lies. But together, together we can choose a different path. We can choose a better path forward to the future, a future of possibility, a future to build and dream and hope. And we’re on that path, moving ahead.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:39)', 'Speech': 'I know this nation. I know you, the American people. I know your courage. I know your hearts, and I know our history. This is a nation that honors our Constitution. We do not reject it. This is a nation that believes in the rule of law. We do not repudiate it. This is a nation that respects free and fair elections. We honor the will of the people. We do not deny it. And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool. We do not encourage violence.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:20)', 'Speech': 'We are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others, patriotism, liberty, justice for all, hope, possibilities. We are still, at our core, a democracy. And yet, history tells us the blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal in democracy. For a long time, we’ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it’s not. We have to defend it, protect it, stand up for it each and every…'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': 'Protect it, stand up for it, each and every one of us. That’s why tonight, I’m asking our nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:22)', 'Speech': 'We’re all called by duty and conscious to confront extremists who put their own pursuit of power above all else. Democrats, Independents, Mainstream Republicans, we must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving American democracy than Maggie Republicans are to destroying American democracy. We, the people, will not let anyone or anything tear us apart. Today, there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail. We hear you’ve heard it; more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It’s not. It can never be an acceptable tool. So, I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None ever.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:28)', 'Speech': 'You saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January 6th. We’ve seen election officials, poll workers, many of them volunteers of both parties, subject to intimidation and death threats. And can you believe it? FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens. On top of that, there are public figures today, yesterday, and the day before predicting and all, but calling for mass violence and riot in streets. This is inflammatory. It’s dangerous. It’s against the rule of law, and we, the people, must say, “This is not who we are.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:22)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, we can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. We’re incompatible. We can’t allow violence to be normalized in this country. It’s wrong. We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster. Now, we can’t let the integrity of our elections be undermined for that is a path to chaos. Look, I know politics can be fierce, and mean, and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give and take of politics, in disagreement, and debate, and dissent. We’re a big complicated country, but democracy endures only if we, the people, respect the guardrails of the republic. Only if we, the people, accept the results of free and fair elections. Only if we, the people, see politics not as total war, but mediation of our differences. Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election. Either they win, or they were cheated. And that’s where the Maggie Republicans are today.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:47)', 'Speech': 'They don’t understand what every patriotic American knows; you can’t love your country only when you win. It’s fundamental. American democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me, only if we respect our legitimate political differences. I will not stand by and watch. I will not… the will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless evidence for claims of fraud. I will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refused to accept that they lost.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:42)', 'Speech': 'I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country, the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, be taken from you and the American people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:54)', 'Speech': 'Look, as your president, I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being, and I’m asking every American to join me.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:09)', 'Speech': 'Throughout our history, America’s often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments like your hearing that bullhorn. I believe we can and must do that again, and we are. Maggie Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair. They spread fear and lies, lies toll for profit and power. But I see a different America. An America with an unlimited future. An America that’s about to take off. I hope you see it as well. Just look around.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:50)', 'Speech': 'I believe we could lift America from the depths of COVID, so we passed the largest economic [inaudible 00:21:55] since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And today, America’s economy is faster, stronger than any other advanced nation in the world. We have more to go.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:07)', 'Speech': 'I believe we could build a better America, so we passed the biggest infrastructure investments since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And we’ve now embarked on a decade of rebuilding the nation’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, water system, high speed internet, railroad.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:27)', 'Speech': 'I believe we could make America safer, so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:35)', 'Speech': 'I believe we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and healthcare more affordable, so we passed the most significant healthcare reform since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:50)', 'Speech': 'And I believe we could create a clean energy future and save the planet, so we passed the most important climate initiative ever, ever, ever.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:12)', 'Speech': 'The cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done, but they’re wrong. There is not a single thing America cannot do, not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together. It’s never easy, but we’re proving that America, no matter how long the road, progress does come.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:38)', 'Speech': 'Look, I know the last year, a few years, have been tough, but today, COVID no longer controls our lives. More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open. Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and their compa-'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': '… Will now get what they deserve for their families in their compensation. American manufacturers come alive across the heart land and the future will be made in America. No matter what the white supremacists and the extremists say, I made a bet on you, the American people, and that bet is paying off, proving that from darkness, the darkness of Charlottesville, of COVID, of gun violence, of insurrection, we can see the light, light is now visible. Light that will guide us forward, not only in words, but in actions, actions for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, for America.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:47)', 'Speech': 'Even in this moment, with all the challenge that we face, I give you my word as a Biden I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future, not because it may be because of who you are.

We’re going to think big, we’re going to make the 21st century another American century, because the world needs us to. That’s where we need to focus our energy, not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:29)', 'Speech': 'The MAGA Republican’s believe that for them to succeed everyone else has to fail. They believe America not like I believe about America. I believe America’s big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we’re building, a nation where no one is left behind. I ran for present because I believe we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are, the soul is what makes us us.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:06)', 'Speech': 'The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God, that all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect, that all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence, and that democracy, democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:34)', 'Speech': 'Folks, and it’s up to us, democracy begins and will be preserved in we, the people’s, habits of the heart, in our character, optimism that is tested, yet endures, courage that digs deep when we need it. Empathy that fuels democracy, the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans. Look, our democracy’s imperfect, it always has been. Notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there, they’re entitled to be outrageous.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:19)', 'Speech': 'This is a democracy, but history and common sense. Good manners is nothing they’ve ever suffered from, but history and common sense tell us an opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy. We have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding, but every generation has opened those doors a little bit wider to include more people that have been excluded before.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:54)', 'Speech': 'My fellow Americans, Americas is an idea, the most powerful idea in the history of the world, and it beats in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all our hearts, it unites America, it is the American creed, the idea that American guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor, it installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve. That’s who we are, that’s what we stand for, that’s what we believe, and that’s precisely what we’re doing. Opening doors, creating possibilities, focusing on the future, and we’re only just beginning.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:50)', 'Speech': 'Our task is to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole, and this work is the work of democracy. The work of this generation is the work of our time, for all time, we can’t afford to leave anyone on the sidelines. We need everyone to do their part, so speak up, speak out, get engaged, vote, vote, vote.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (29:21)', 'Speech': 'And if we do our duty, if we do our duty in 2022 and beyond, then ages still to come will say we, all of us here, we kept the faith, we preserved democracy, we heeded not our worst instincts, but our better angels, and we proved that for all its imperfections, America is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept. There’s nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American. That’s our soul, that’s who we truly are, and that’s who must, we must always be.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:07)', 'Speech': 'I have no doubt, none, that this is who we will be, and that we’ll come together as a nation that will secure our democracy, that for the next 200 years we’ll have what we had the past 200 years, the greatest nation on the face of the earth, we just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America, the United States of America, and may God protect our nation, and may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy. God bless you all, democracy, thank you.'}]"

Before I start, I want to say a word about a few good friends that we lost. A guy named Jack Shea, some of you knew, and Pat Gillespie, both good friends. People I worked with my whole career. They had an attitude that could be summed up in one word in my view, a little bit like my dad would say, “Everybody, everyone, no matter what your background, is entitled to be treated with dignity.” With dignity. With respect. I want to thank the elected officials here today. Bobby Casey’s been a close friend of mine for a long time. His dad and I are friends, as well. Matter of fact, we are ages split. His dad was much older than him and me than I am to Bobby. We raised in the same neighborhood in Green Ridge, about five city blocks away. Went to the same grade schools.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:07)', 'Speech': 'I’ve moved, because when Cole died in Scranton, there weren’t any jobs. My dad was in sales, not in mining, but we moved back down to Delaware where he was from. Moved to a little steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Claymont used to have [inaudible 00:01:25] steel. Used to have almost 5,000 steel workers. Whole community was built. It was a company town literally. And steel died, was dying, and there’s not a single steel worker left. But we know what happened was about midway through my … I got elected. I got very engaged, in my case, in the civil rights movement. As a kid, I worked a lot in the movement and worked, and I got deeply involved in the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party in Delaware was a Southern democratic party then. We were more a southern state than a northeastern state. And I got involved and one thing led to another. And one day a group came to me of the senior members of the party and said they wanted me to run for the Senate.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:16)', 'Speech': 'I said, “I’m not old enough.” And I wasn’t. I was only 29 years old. And a former chief justice whose family had more United States senators than any family and American history looked at me and he said, “You obviously didn’t do very well in law school, Joe.” He said, “You don’t have to be 30 to be elected. You have to be 29. You can be 29. You just can’t get sworn in until your 30.” One thing led to another and I ended up deciding to run. But I was having great difficulty getting support, even though people liked me or at least the labor guys liked me. They didn’t think I could win. Until I got brought up to Pittsburgh by the local leader, the steelworkers in Delaware. And into Pittsburgh, and came to here and met with the then president of the steelworkers. He endorsed me about nine weeks out and I won by 3,100 votes.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:12)', 'Speech': 'The fact is you guys own me. You’ve been with me from the beginning. And look folks, Bobby, Representative Boyle Represent Lamb, Mayor Gainey, your county executive who is a hell of a guy, and John. If I have to be in the fox hole, I want John Fetterman in there with me. I’ll tell you what, I want John in there with me. I mean that sincerely. Look, there’s a whole lot of folks here. I don’t want to keep you standing much longer, but let me just say a couple things.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:49)', 'Speech': 'Number one, I started my campaign because Tom jumped in and convinced me … didn’t convince me, made the case, I should run. Because that train ride, I wasn’t running. I was campaigning for Democrats. I was out of office and I was campaigning for Democrats. But you know what? This is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a totally different party, man. These guys are different. I’ve worked with a lot of Republicans, conservative Republicans, I worked with. Got a lot done, but there was always something decent about the work. But then we moved to this place where all of a sudden, the reason it made me run I decided was when you saw those people coming out of the fields down in Virginia, carrying torches, literally coming out of the fields, carrying torches was swastikas, chanting the same antisemitic bile that was chanted in literally the same antisemitic bile chanted in Germany in the thirties, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:51)', 'Speech': 'The guy that I beat in this last election, and when they asked what he thought, he said, “There were really fine people on both sides.” I said, “Something’s really wrong. Something’s changing.” That’s when I talked to Tom and others about helping me out. They decided to help me out, because look folks, here’s where I think we are. And I’m going to be brief. The fact is that I think there are periods in history where we reach certain inflection points. Where everything is going to come after is going to change what’s been before for the next generation. We’re in one of those points. It happens every six or eight generations. Things are changing. They’re changing rapidly. You see everything from what’s happening in Europe and India. From Russia, China. Things are changing. The United States has to regain its footing and remember who we are.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:46)', 'Speech': 'One of the things that I concluded was that those inflection points are the places where you look back two, five, 10 years later and realize it’s just not what it was before. It’s either better or worse than it was before. Not the same. You’re not going to go back to the same. I’m absolutely convinced, and I mean this, no one’s ever doubt I mean what I say, the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. But all kidding aside, one of the things that was clear to me is that this new group headed by the former president, the former defeated president, we found ourselves in a situation where we either going to look forward or look backwards. It’s clear which way he wants to look. It’s clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:37)', 'Speech': 'They’re extreme and democracy’s really at stake. You can’t be a democracy when you support violence when you don’t like the outcome of election. You can’t call yourself a democracy when you don’t in fact, count the votes that people legitimately cast and count that as who you are. You can’t be a democracy and call yourself one if you continue to do what they’re doing. And so folks, look, we have a choice. When Trump and the MAGA Republicans made their choice. We can choose to build a better America or we can continue down this sliding path of oblivion to where we don’t want to go.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:17)', 'Speech': 'Under the American Rescue Plan, and I’m not going to go through all these things, but just to give me an example. We created nearly 10 million jobs in my first 16 months. 10 million new jobs in America. That American Rescue Plan also created and saved millions of jobs. Why? Because here in the state of Pennsylvania and almost every state didn’t enough have enough money to keep teachers on the payroll, to keep firefighters in the job, to keep police on the job, to keep people, nurses and docs on the job. What did we do? We in fact gave them the money to make sure they did it. This governor, your governor, spent it well. Hiring thousands of firefighters and the like.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:08)', 'Speech': 'What happened was we found ourselves because of the greed of some companies. We found that an awful lot of union members were about to lose their pensions. We did something that hadn’t been done in 50 years, significantly for labor, we passed the Butch Lewis Act. The Butch Lewis Act. They told me I couldn’t do it. They told me … They really did. Remember, we didn’t and we didn’t get any Republican votes for it, but we got it done. We got it done because it’s just about basic decency and fairness. Look, every single Republican voted against that. Every single one. The bipartisan infrastructure law. We’re building roads and bridges and ports. Matter of fact, I’m going to be back here, not too long from now because we got 60 million to rebuild that bridge that collapsed the day I came here, not long ago.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:00)', 'Speech': 'Folks, the money’s going to go to expanding a nearly 100-year old failing lock and dam outside Pittsburgh. It’s costing us millions, but it makes a big difference in terms of the economy. We’re going to build a new terminal at the Pittsburgh airport. We’re doing this all over the country. All over the country and it’s creating good decent jobs. But the reason why I talk about unions is not just because it’s where I come from. It’s more than that. It’s more than that. I said, I spoke to the business round table, the CEOs of the largest companies in the United States, the National Chamber of Commerce. I’ve been straightforward with them. I said, “Look, I’m a union guy. I support them for one reason, because in your interest.” They look at me like, what are you talking about? You are the best trained, the most skilled workers in the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:52)', 'Speech': 'I’m not just saying it. Most people don’t realize to join a lot of the trade unions you have to have four or five, six months, six years of training. It’s like going to college. You get paid now you’re there, but not very much, but it is you’re the best in the world. And it makes a hell of a lot of sense for America to spend and companies to spend a little more money to have something going to last a whole hell of a lot longer than it is to do something on the cheap. Look, you’ve heard me say it before. Wall Street, didn’t build the middle class. Wall Street didn’t build America. The middle class built America and unions built the middle class. That’s just a fact.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:36)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, the other thing that I found out, I haven’t been in the Senate a long time, and vice president. I didn’t realize there was a law passed in the early thirties under Roosevelt and the press is looking at me like, “What’s he going to say now?” I’m going to tell them. That in fact said, “Buy American” That any money a president spent that was appropriated, he could insist that the money could only be spent on American products. Well, guess what? We’re buying American. And I get to spend of your money as president, I get to allocate over $600 billion. $600 billion every year. And there are American made products made by American workers in America. That’s why we’re moving. Where is it written to say that we can’t be a great manufacturing facility hub in America, in the world again?'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:34)', 'Speech': 'We’ve made sure that we have now over 640,000 new manufacturing jobs. Where would it say we can’t do this? I start off with the proposition that it’s about just basic decency. I’m not going to go on much longer, I promise. Here’s what’s happened. We don’t have a tax system that’s fair at all. It’s not even close. That’s why, for example, I’ve been pushing for tax fairness for a long, long time. But guess what? They told me, I couldn’t do that either. Well, there were 55 corporations in America in 2020 that made over $400 billion and didn’t pay a single penny in income tax. Not a single penny. Now they’re paying a minimum of 15% in their income tax.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:21)', 'Speech': 'And guess what? To talk about the Inflation Reduction Act. I’ve been fighting when I was a Senator for a long, long time, fighting the pharma-companies. Fighting so the Medicare could set the price they’d pay for Medicare drugs and negotiate for those drugs. Well guess what? Anybody of you, you don’t have to raise your hand, but any of you have a child who has type two diabetes and needs insulin every day? Once a week? Well guess what? It costs those outfits 15 bucks to make and package it. That’s all it takes. You know what they charge? They charge somewhere between 625 bucks a month and a thousand bucks a month. It’s wrong. It’s simply wrong. They can make three and a half times the profit that cost them to do it. Well, they said it couldn’t be done. Well, guess what? We were able to change it. So allowing what’s been working for a long time, allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:20)', 'Speech': 'We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world here in the United States of America. And guess what? There’s no rationale for it. We finally passed. Medicare’s now negotiating. No senior because of what we did in the Inflation Reduction Act, no senior, no matter how big their drug bills, if they’re fighting cancer or any other serious problem, and they’re spending thousands and thousands of dollars on treatment, guess what? They’ll not have to pay more than $2,000 a month, no matter what their bill is. No matter what their bill. They need insulin, they won’t have to pay more than $35 a month. No matter. I’ve been fighting pharma for my entire career. My entire career. And we finally beat pharma. We finally beat pharma. Not a single Republican vote, not a single vote.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:20)', 'Speech': 'We respect you for it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:21)', 'Speech': 'Well, I tell you what, the fact is that there’s a lot more we have to do. Like I said, we built 650,000 manufacturing jobs in America. Today, unions in this country have now had the support, whether union members or not, of over 60% of the American people. Never before has unions been that popular. Labor. Unions. Unions. Over 60% of the American people think it’s important because they’re figuring out you are the bulwark against excess. You’re the ones. You’re the ones.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:56)', 'Speech': 'By the way, all of you, I shouldn’t say all, like many of you, I wasn’t raised poor, but we weren’t wealthy. We lived in a three bedroom split level home in a little town, little area called Mayfield in Delaware with four kids a mom and a dad and a grand pop living with us. But we were all right. We were all right. But you could always tell when the things were going rough. You could hear in the wall … We had two sets of bunks in one room. You could hear my dad when he was restless and hear the headboard move. Remember asking my mom one day, what’s the matter with dad? She said, “Honey, we just lost our insurance.” People shouldn’t have to face that reality in America. That shouldn’t be the case.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:41)', 'Speech': 'Unions have made sure you didn’t have to face that, but the rest of the country still is struggling. And finally, we are making significant changes in healthcare. We now are in a situation where we’ve been able to put another $2,400 bucks for a family of four to reduce the price of insurance for under the Affordable Care Act. And by the way, these guys are still going after the Affordable Care Act. They want to get rid of it. The only reason anybody with a preexisting condition that isn’t wealthy and can afford a very expensive policy has any coverage is because of the Affordable Care Act. The only reason. And they’re still going after it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:19)', 'Speech': 'And social security. Since your first paycheck you’ve been paying for social security. Well guess what? The guy heading up the Republican campaign committee for the United States Senate, Senator Scott from the south and the guys whose home state I just left in Wisconsin, these guys don’t even think social security should be guaranteed. They want it on the ballot box on the ballot every five years. Every five years it has to be reauthorized. You paid for it. The guy in Wisconsin, he concluded that it should be every single year. Every single year should have to vote on whether or not you keep social security. Whether you keep it or cut it or change it or alter it. What’s going on here, man? This is not the country that most of you, this is not the country most Republicans who represented this state supported for the longest time.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:10)', 'Speech': 'Folks look, the fact is that when you have social security that’s under attack, when you have Medicare that’s under attack, when the refusal to stick with finding, making sure that you’re in a circumstance where you have some access to healthcare, this is again … We can change things. And we’re going to change it for the better. Here’s the deal. As I said, Wall Street didn’t build this country, the middle class built it and unions built the middle class.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:40)', 'Speech': 'Let me close in a serious note. When I announced and I meant it, I got roundly criticized with good reason, it was legitimate to criticize me on it. I said I was running for three reasons. One to restore the soul of America. By that I meant decency, honor, meaning what you say. Literally treating people with some respect. Second reason I said I was running, is I was so sick and tired of trickle down economics. I wanted to build the economy from the bottom up in the middle out because when that happens, the wealthy do very, very well. They do very well.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:13)', 'Speech': 'And everybody’s got a shot. Everybody’s got a shot. The third reason I said I was running because I wanted to unite the country. Because you can’t maintain a democracy without being able to reach a consensus. I’ve spent a lot of time with foreign leaders from the leader of China, Russia, et cetera. Leader of China, Xi Jingping just tells me straight up, I’ve spent more time with many other head of state, over 76 hours. And guess what he said? Democracies can’t be sustained in the 21st century because they require consensus and things are moving so rapidly you can’t get consensus. That’s why autocracies are going to succeed. Well, I reject that notion. I reject it. I think we can come out of what we got into stronger than we got into it. Stronger than before we started.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:00)', 'Speech': 'And folks look, all of us love the country, but you can’t love the country and say how much you love it, when you only accept one or two outcomes from an election. Either you won or you were cheated. It doesn’t work that way. You can’t love the country when you refuse to maintain just the basic democratic principles that were set out that we all learn from the time we were kids in school. That you accept the outcomes of elections. You can’t say you love the country, when in fact you either win or you have been cheated. That’s where we are now, and there’s much more to say, but I’ve already said too much to you, but here’s the deal. I am absolutely convinced. I’m absolutely convinced. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, there’s not a thing we can’t do in America.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:01)', 'Speech': 'I mean it. Not a single solitary thing we can’t do if we do it together. I mean it. It’s about time we stand up and remember who in God’s name we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. Let’s go out and demand and it’s an easy proposition. We’ll win if people vote. So just remind everybody vote. Go out and vote. We vote, we win, and reestablish this country and make it even better than it was before. Thank you all for standing so long. God love you. I went way beyond. Thank you. What am I doing? I’m going out here?'}]"

I’m John Rogers, the Chairman of the White House Historical Association, and on behalf of the women and men of the association, I’m thrilled to celebrate with all of you the presentation of two magnificent American portraits today to honor and commemorate the indelible legacy of our 44th President and First Lady. Mrs. Obama, President Obama, it is a privilege to be able to carry forward this time-honored tradition of unveiling the official portraits and welcome them to the White House to be forever accessible and viewed by the public on these historic walls. Since it’s founding in 1961 by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, the White House Historical Association has been of service and our privilege to be able to acquire official portraits of those who previously were missing from the White House Collection and to commission all of the portraits on record of each president and first lady since our founding. Surviving the modern era of photography and film and technology, few mediums can transport us with such immediacy and intimacy than the American portrait.'}, {'Time': 'John Rogers: (01:24)', 'Speech': 'Capturing at once the power, the restraint, the courage, and the beauty of the human spirit, the portraits of our first family stand apart, each a painstaking exploration of a singular person, a human life conveyed in still, otherwise ever in motion and fulfilling the obligations to their oath. More than just the unveiling of our assemblage today, it’s integral to the broader set of symbols and rituals and emblematic gestures distinctly American that sustain the superiority and the standing of our republic, bridging one presidency to the next, the way we do one generation to the next, honoring the past as much as we look to the future. As we become more culturally and demographically diverse with ideas that are both molten and disparate pertaining to the future of our nation, our work to ensure the promise of what President Obama once called the unlikely story that is America has never been more intertwined with preserving what has been symbolically and foundationally at the heart of our storied resilience as a nation.'}, {'Time': 'John Rogers: (02:43)', 'Speech': 'And in this way, today is a reminder that America is governed not by a disconnected series of presidents, but rather by the enduring presidency. And within the greater story that’s told by the 43 other portraits, we boldly celebrate their contrast and their confluence, certainly artistically, but also as distinguished chapters in the American narrative.'}, {'Time': 'John Rogers: (03:07)', 'Speech': 'And notably today, as the first Black American first family at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and with whom… And with whom we shared the joy of watching your wonderful daughters grow up here and come of age. Mrs. Obama, we thank you for your advocacy on behalf of this house and for making it possible for visitors to take pictures of these magnificent portraits among the other historic artifacts throughout the White House. I had the personal privilege of being with you and your mom when we inducted your inaugural gown into the Smithsonian Collection. And may I say that the beauty of that white chiffon gown is only exceeded by the woman who wore it, and whose spirit is captured in this portrait.'}, {'Time': 'John Rogers: (04:32)', 'Speech': 'The tradition of service continues with Dr. Biden. She’s our steward. We are honored that you were with us when we celebrated our 60th anniversary and we look forward to our continued work with you on the educational mission of our association. And we are ever thankful to you and you, Mr. President, for hosting this wonderful ceremony today. And to our artists, Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung, we are grateful for your artisanship and dedication to your own craft. Together, these portraits fulfill a beautiful collaboration and are a testament to what’s possible when we serve one another in an effort to give voice to one another. And I suspect that, beginning tomorrow, these two portraits will be the most photographed by visitors from across the United States and the world. And it’s now my pleasure to introduce an admirer of great institutions and national treasures, the President of the United States of America.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:45)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (05:55)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ” Whoa” is right. Thank you all very much. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (06:22)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, John Rogers and the White House Historical Society. Barack and Michelle, welcome home. Welcome home. Jill and I and Kamala and Doug are honored to host you and so many friends who have been part of this incredible journey. It includes members of your cabinet staff, some of whom were foolish enough to come work with me. And there’s someone else that I’d like to acknowledge tonight, Mrs. Robinson, this is your house as well. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (07:06)', 'Speech': 'It’s good to see you again, mom, it really is. It’s also good to see Ms. Wilson, who known affectionately as Mama Kaye. One of your best friends and Malia and Sasha’s godmother. And as they say in Southern [inaudible 00:07:29], “You done good kid.” And President Kennedy once observed that every president must endure the gap between what he would like and what is possible. He was right. The history books are full of stories about presidents trying to bridge that gap, stories that include the burdens of the office, the difficult decisions, how the work is always serious and often solemn, and all of that’s true, but so is this. With Barack as our president, we got up every day and went to work full of hope, for real, full of purpose and excited about the possibility before us. There are few people I’ve ever known with more integrity, decency, and moral courage than Barack Obama.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:27)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, nothing could have prepared me better or more to become President of the United States than be at your side for eight years. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. No matter what the issue was, no matter how difficult, no matter what it was about, you never did it just the easy way, what the easy way out was. It was never about doing it that, it was always about doing what was right, literally. Just go down the list of historic presidencies. He never gave up on the simple truth that healthcare was a right for all Americans. When so many were telling him, including me at one point, “Take the compromise. Take the compromise.” We weren’t sure we could get anything done on ACA. “Think about the compromise.” You refused. You went big and now the Affordable Care Act is there permanently and is even being improved on.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:23)', 'Speech': 'Because I remember what you told me, you said, “How can I look those people in the eye and leave anybody behind?” You weren’t about to do that. His Recovery Act brought America back from a great recession. The Auto Rescue protected an iconic industry that represents the nation’s heart and soul. And there were a whole lot of people, some maybe even in this room that were telling you we should let the industry go bankrupt. We should let it go. But you wouldn’t, you persisted, you insisted. And I remember our conversations and I’m proud. I’m proud we stood together and wouldn’t let that happen.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:08)', 'Speech': 'You bet on the American worker. You believed in the American worker. Even though he knew it would be controversial, you stood up for hundreds of thousands of dreamers, dreamers who only know America’s their home. It always boggles my mind that others can’t understand that a three year old kid’s going to say, “No, mom. Leave me in this side of the Rio Grande, you go ahead and go.” I’m serious. So they could stay and contribute and they’ve been contributing incredibly, their talents, and it’s a great generation they represent.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:40)', 'Speech': 'I can go on and defend all that you’ve done, expanding civil rights, issue declaring the call on the climate crisis, helped us find that amazing grace, that amazing grace, even in darkness and countless hours over countless meetings under intense pressure, we always knew Barack Obama, we always knew what you’d…'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:11:01]. We always knew Barack Obama. We always knew what you’d do, what you thought was right, even if it was going to cost you politically. We trusted him, all of you in this room. We believed in him and we counted on him, and I still do. And I still do. President, that’s why the country elected you twice. That’s why you’ll be considered one of the most consequential presidents in our history, along with one of the most consequential first ladies. Michelle, he knows, we all know, he couldn’t have done it without you. I know I couldn’t.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:57)', 'Speech': 'In fact, we had lunch once a week, every week, come hell or high water. Everybody wondered all the important things we talked about. Probably 40% of the time we talked about family. We most talked about our girls and my grandchildren and my children. You embody dignity beyond measure, Michelle. Together, you and Barack made history. You both generated hope for millions of people who were left behind for so long. And it matters. You both did it with such grace and such class. You dreamed big and secured lasting winds for the American people, helping lift their burden with the blessing of hope. I so underestimated the notion of just having hope. This is a gift of the Obama presidency to the country and to history. It’s a gift I felt personally. As we used to say in the Senate, Mr. President, excuse a point of personal privilege, you were always there. I remember how you were with me when our son was passing. I remember the eulogy you gave in his behalf. You’ll never fully understand how much it meant to Jill and me and the entire family.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:12)', 'Speech': 'I always remember that night we accepted the nomination in Denver. My granddaughter Finnegan, who is a great friend of your daughters, called and came up to the room, our room, and said, “Pop, can we move the beds out of my room?” I said, “Why do you want to move the beds out of the room?” She said, “Well,” so her two sisters and Malia and Sasha, “we could all get sleeping bags and lie on the floor and sleep together and watch the convention on the floor.”'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:42)', 'Speech': 'That image of them all together will stay with me forever. I think it melded our families in ways that it’s hard for other people to understand. For eight years, we grew to be a family for each other, through our highs and our lows. A family from different backgrounds brought together by a shared value set. All the things that the families have done together, I imagine, there may have been other relationships like this, the president and vice president, but none comes to mind.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:18)', 'Speech': 'Jill and I have been waiting to host events at the White House for a long time coming out of the pandemic. It’s fitting. It’s fitting that we can do that now by unveiling the portraits of two dear friends and two great Americans who are still held very tightly in the hearts of the American people, portraits that are going to hang on the walls of this sacred place, the people’s house, forever, and a reminder of all here and now for those to come to power that hope and change matters.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:47)', 'Speech': 'Barack and Michelle, it’s my honor to invite you both to the stage for the unveiling of your official portraits. Come on up.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (14:53)', 'Speech': 'Everybody. Yes. Okay. There we go. Thank you so much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Please, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sit down, everybody. Thank you very much. It is great to be back. President and Dr. Biden, Vice President Harris and Second Gentleman Emhoff, thank you so much for your hospitality. Thanks for letting us invite a few friends to the White House. We will try not to tear up the place.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (16:42)', 'Speech': 'Someone once said that if you’re looking for a friend in Washington, get a dog. Our family was lucky enough to have two wonderful dogs. But I was even luckier to have a chance to spend eight years working day and night with a man who became a true partner and a true friend.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (17:14)', 'Speech': 'Joe, it is now America’s good fortune to have you as president. You guided us … You have guided us through some perilous times. You’ve built on and gone beyond the work we all did together to expand healthcare, to fight climate change, to advance social justice, and to promote economic fairness. Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength, maybe most of all thanks to your faith in our democracy and the American people, the country’s better off than when you took office, and we should all be deeply grateful for that. So thank you so much'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (18:43)', 'Speech': 'To all the former Obama-Biden staffers who are here in person, some of you are watching at home, thank you for being a part of this. When people ask me what I miss most about the White House years, it is not Air Force One that I talk about, although I miss Air Force One. It’s the chance that I had to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with all of you, to have a chance to witness so many talented, selfless, idealistic, good people working tirelessly every day to make the world better. For eight years, and even longer for some of you, I drew on your energy and your dedication and your goodness. You inspired me, and I never wanted to disappoint you. I tried to reflect the same heart and character that you displayed every day. Even during the toughest times, it was all of you that kept me going. So it’s good to be back to have a chance to see all of you and to once again say thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (20:11)', 'Speech': 'Now, as much as I miss our work together, what’s been a special joy is to see what’s happened since, because so many of you are doing amazing things, whether it’s in government, in the private sector, in academia, or nonprofits, and I’m especially glad to see so many of you serving President Biden as well as you served me.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (20:38)', 'Speech': 'Although now some of you who, let’s face it, you were kids back then, are now in charge and running the show, which that’s a little shocking and may also explain some of the gray hairs I’m seeing on some of you. But it validates what I had always hoped, which was that our time together would only be the beginning of incredibly impactful careers. Some of you who I’ve had a chance to stay in touch with, I’m thrilled to see that you started families of your own. I am a little disappointed that I haven’t heard of anyone naming a kid Barack yet …'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (21:26)', 'Speech': 'Or Michelle.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (21:26)', 'Speech': '… Or Michelle, but there is still time. Finally, I want to say a special thanks to the White House staff. We had a chance to see them all beforehand. Yes. Yeah. You took incredible care of our family for …'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (22:04)', 'Speech': 'You took incredible care of our family for eight years, and along the way you became a part of it, and we have not ever forgotten the kindness that you showed us. Now, when Michelle and I had our portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery a few years back, I said that as far as I could tell, no one in my family tree had ever sat for a portrait before. I certainly had not, and now all of a sudden we’ve done it twice. But these portraits have a special significance because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other presidents and first ladies dating back to George and Martha.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (22:49)', 'Speech': 'So it was important to find the right people to paint them. I want to thank Sharon Sprung for capturing everything I love about Michelle, her grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she’s fine. She’s fine, she is. Her portrait is stunning. I want to thank Robert McCarty for taking on a much more difficult subject and doing a fantastic job with mine. Robert is known for his paintings of public figures. Tony Morrison, the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali. But what I love about Robert’s work is that he paints people exactly the way they are, for better or worse. He captures every wrinkle on your face. Every crease in your shirt. You’ll note that he refused to hide any of my gray hairs; refuse my request to make my ears smaller. He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (24:49)', 'Speech': 'His work is so precise that for glance, it looks like a photograph, and Robert also paints his subjects looking straight ahead. So it feels like you’re face to face forming a connection, and that appealed to me, in part, because presidents so often get airbrushed. They even take on a mythical status, especially after you’ve gone and people forget all the stuff they didn’t like about you. But what you realize when you’re sitting behind that desk, and what I want people to remember about Michelle and me, is that presidents and first ladies are human beings like everyone else. We have our gifts. We have our flaws. You’ve all experienced mine. We have good days and bad days. We feel the same joy and sadness, frustration and hope. While it takes a certain amount of self-confidence to be president, there are nights where we lie awake wondering if this or that decision was the right one.'}, {'Time': 'Barack Obama: (25:59)', 'Speech': 'I’ve always described the presidency as a relay race. You take the baton from someone, you run your leg as hard and as well as you can, and then you hand it off to someone else, knowing that your work will be incomplete. The portraits hanging in the White House, chronicle the runners in that race. Each of us tasked with trying to bring the country we love closer to its highest aspirations. When future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better honest sense of who Michelle and I were, and I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too. They can do remarkable things, too. Now it is my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction: Michelle was the best thing about living in the White House, and let me tell you, the Patriot chefs here delivered delicious pies on request. So that is saying something. I could not ask for a better life partner, and in my humble opinion, America could not have asked for a better first lady. Please give it up for Michelle Obama.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (27:58)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Okay. Thank you, everybody. Well, let me thank my husband, first of all, for such spicy remarks, and of course, thank you to Joe and Jill. President Biden, and First Lady Jill Biden. Thank you for inviting us back. This means so much to us. We were saying at lunch that the girls have lived in this house longer than they’ve lived anywhere, and so this as out of a home as this can be as wonderful as it can be, it is a special place because we raised our girls here, and it means so much to come back to friends and to be able to spend time talking about our girls. So I am grateful to both of you for the work that you’re doing, the love that you’re showing us, our staff, and the work that you’re doing for this country, thank you so much, and, of course, to Vice President Harris. I love to say this, Second Gentleman Emhoff. Let’s say it again, second gentleman, you’re doing a great job.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (29:41)', 'Speech': 'Thank you for joining us today, and I can’t go any further without of course acknowledging all of the amazing staff, friends. You’re more than staff, your friends, your family, to us, particularly the people who’ve been part of my team over the years. I don’t have time to name everyone. Thank goodness. But you all know who you are from the campaign to the White House to today. I would not be who I am without your passion and your faith and all the love that you poured into everything that we accomplished together, and it was amazing, historic. What did Sam Kass use to say?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (30:26)', 'Speech': 'Unprecedented.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (30:27)', 'Speech': 'Unprecedented, You all mean the world to me, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. So thank you. Proud of you. Proud of the work that you’ve done. Proud of what you’re doing. I also want to take the time to recognize the resident staff, as Barack said, you guys made this a home. We snatched up a few of you all and took you with us. But for those of you who we couldn’t bring, we miss you so much. We miss you so much. The best part about this house was you all. So it’s so good to see you, and you all look good, so good. I’d also like to recognize Stewart McLaurin, of course, John Rogers. It’s been amazing working with you all over the years. I have to recognize Bill Allman, who has been fabulous to work with over the years, and of course, Thelma Golden, and my dear friend, Michael Smith, we are where we are because of their comprehensive and rigorous work to identify these incredible artists.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (31:53)', 'Speech': 'That brings me to our artists, of course. Robert McCurdy, you did a good job. You did a good job, but I got to spend a lot of time with Sharon Sprung, and Sharon now joins a small, but mighty group of women who’ve painted an official portrait here at the White House. I’m thrilled that this extraordinary work was going to be enshrined forever as part of our nation’s history. But, Sharon, it was wonderful to work with you. You are a true spirit. That’s one of the reasons why we connected. Your work is phenomenal, but it was your essence, your soul, the way you saw me, the way we interacted, and it shows in this beautiful work. So thank you for your brilliance, your artistry, and your patience in this process. I remember I went to see the work in Brooklyn, and poor Sharon, because no one…'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (33:03)', 'Speech': '… see the work in Brooklyn, and poor Sharon, because no one is supposed to know who the artists are. Her studio is her home. She had this piece in her home. You couldn’t have guests over. You were frightened that it would get out. You just wanted it out of your space. And every year I thought about, she must be going crazy. Thank you. Thank you so much. Let’s give them both a round of applause.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (33:40)', 'Speech': 'Oh, believe it or not, it is still a bit odd for me to stand in this historic space, see this big, beautiful painting staring back at me. Growing up on Euclid Avenue … Mommy … I never could have imagined that any of this would be part of my story. But even if it’s all still a bit awkward for me, I do recognize why moments like these are important. Why all of this is absolutely necessary. Traditions like this matter. Not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (34:24)', 'Speech': 'You see the people, they make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Those of us lucky enough to serve, work, as Barack said, as hard as we can for as long as we can, as long as the people choose to keep us here. And once our time is up, we move on. All that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits. Portraits that connect our history to the present day. Portraits that hang here as history continues to be made. For me, this day is not just about what has happened, it’s also about what could happen.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (35:12)', 'Speech': 'Because a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolly Madison. She was never supposed to live in this house and she definitely wasn’t supposed to serve as first lady.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (35:40)', 'Speech': 'We love you, Michelle.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (35:40)', 'Speech': 'Love you back. But I’ve always wondered where does that “supposed to” come from? Who determines it? Too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in. That they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to matter. But what we’re looking at today, a portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name, and the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home mom. What we are seeing is a reminder that there’s a place for everyone in this country, because as Barack said, if the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then again, it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (36:38)', 'Speech': 'That is what this country is about. It’s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It’s a place where everyone should have a fair shot. Whether you’re a kid taking two buses and a train just to get to school, or a single mother who’s working two jobs to put some food on the table, or an immigrant just arriving, getting your first apartment, forging a future for yourself in a place you dreamed of. That’s why for me, this day isn’t about me or Barack, it’s not even about these beautiful paintings, it’s about telling that fuller story, a story that includes every single American in every single corner of the country, so that our kids and grandkids can see something more for themselves.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (37:28)', 'Speech': 'And as much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we share, as my husband continues to say, is so much bigger than what we don’t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences. And this little girl from the south side is blessed beyond measure to have felt the truth of that fullest story throughout her entire life, never more so than today.'}, {'Time': 'Michelle Obama: (38:11)', 'Speech': 'Thank you to President Biden, to Sharon, and to all of you today for playing a part in this day and all the days that led to it. Now it is my privilege to introduce someone who is stepping in shoes and doing it well, someone who has devoted so much of her life to education, working to broaden the idea of whose story matters. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome my friend, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (38:44)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Joe, honestly. Everybody stood, but Joe. Thank you, Michelle for a friendship I treasure. 14 years ago. 14 years ago, Michelle, on a cool night in November, a sea of people gathered in Grant Park to be a part of history. There was laughter and music and dancing. There were tears as friends and strangers alike held each other, overwhelmed with the joy that hope and change had been realized. The crowd roared, radiating the sense that anything we could dream was within our reach.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (40:20)', 'Speech': 'But at the heart of that enormous moment was a family. Two little girls who would grow up exploring the secret halls and hideaways of the White House. A mom who would bring her whole heart to serving the American people as First Lady, while still guiding and protecting her family with a ferocious devotion. A grandmother who would do absolutely anything for the family she loves, and even move to Washington, DC. And a father who showed the world the meaning of yes we can.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (41:06)', 'Speech': 'For Joe and me, and our entire family, standing on that stage next to you was like waking up in a new world. A place where with hard work anything was possible. And it wasn’t just the Bidens. So many of you were also there. You remember how it felt. It was magic, wasn’t it? That night your family connected us all. And our family, the Obama-Biden team, every one of you who were fired up and ready to go, together, we changed the course of this country forever. When I look at these portraits, I see family. Your family, the family we all built, and the families across America that we served together. I see love, joy, and fellowship, and we are honored to hang them today and share them with the world.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Jill Biden: (42:32)', 'Speech': 'Thank you for being with us. Now please join us in the state dining room for a reception. Thank you for being here.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (42:41)', 'Speech': 'Ladies gentlemen, please remain-'}]"

I’m honored to be here with you once more to share this solemn rite of remembrance and reflect on all that was lost in the fire and ash on that terrible September morning and all that we found on ourselves to respond.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:41)', 'Speech': '21 years ago. 21 years, and we still kept our promise, never forget. We’ll keep the memory of all those precious lives stolen from us. 2,977 at Ground Zero in New York and Shanksville, where my wife is speaking now in Pennsylvania. 184 of them here at the Pentagon. And I know for all those of you who’ve lost someone, 21 years is both a lifetime and no time at all. It’s good to remember. These memories help us heal, but they can also open up the hurt and take us back to that moment when the grief was so raw. You think of everything. Everything that they could have done if they had lived and just had a little more time. The experience you missed together, the dreams they never got to fulfill or realize.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:46)', 'Speech': 'I remember a message sent to the American people from Queen Elizabeth. It was on September 11. Her ambassador read a prayer of service at St. Thomas Church in New York where she pointedly reminded us, quote, “Grief is the price we pay for love.” Grief is the price we pay for love. Many of us have experienced that grief and you’ve all experienced it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:19)', 'Speech': 'And on this day when the price feels so great, Jill and I are holding all of you close to our hearts. Terror struck us in that brilliant blue morning. The air filled with smoke and then came the sirens and the stories. Stories of those we lost, stories of the incredible heroism from that terrible day. The American story. The American story itself changed that day. But what we did change, what we will not change, what we cannot change and never will, is the character of this nation that the terrorist thought they could wound.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:08)', 'Speech': 'And what is that character? The character of sacrifice and love, of generosity and grace, of strength and resilience. And the crucible of 9/11 in the days and months that followed, we saw what stuff Americans are made of. Think of all of your loved ones, particularly those on that flight. Ordinary citizens who said, “We will not let this stand.” Risked and lost their lives, so even more people would not die. We saw it in the police officers and firefighters who stood on the pile on Ground Zero for months amid that twisted steel and broken concrete slabs breathing the toxins and ash that would damage their health, Refusing, refusing to stop the search through the destruction. They never stopped and would not.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:13)', 'Speech': 'We learned about the extraordinary courage and resolve, as I said, of the passengers on board Flight 93, who understood that they were there in the middle of the open shot of a new war and who chose to fight back. Not professionals, fight back sacrificing themselves, refusing to let their plane be used as a weapon against even more innocence.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:44)', 'Speech': 'And here at the Pentagon, which is both the scene of the horrific terrorist attack and the command center for our response to defend and protect the American people, so many heroes were made here. So many of your loved ones were those heroes. Began almost immediately with civilians and service members leaping to action as the walls collapsed and the roof began to crumble. They raced into the breach between the fourth and fifth garters. The impact created by the fire, raids at twice the height of this building, I remember. I was a US senator walking up to my office and I could see the smoke in flames. They were heroes. They went back into those soaring flames to try to save their teammates. Firefighters battled the blaze of jet fuel, long into the night, pushing past the bounds of exhaustion. Pentagon staff showed up to work on September 12th, more determined than ever to keep their country secure.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:05)', 'Speech': 'As I said, when I was up at 9/11, we will follow them to the gates of hell to be sure that they’re not able to continue. And millions of young men and women from across the nation responded to 9/11 attacks with courage and resolve, signing up to defend our constitution and joining the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. In the years since 9/11, hundreds of thousands of American troops have served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many other places around the world to deny terrorists a safe haven and to protect the American people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:44)', 'Speech': 'To all our service members and their families, our veterans, our Gold Star families, all the survivors and caregivers and loved ones who sacrifice so much for our nation, we owe you. We owe you an incredible, an incredible debt. A debt that can never be repaid but will never fail to meet the sacred obligation to you. And to properly prepare and equip those that we send into harms way and care for those and their families when they come home. And to never, ever, ever forget through all that has changed over the last 21 years, the enduring resolve of the American people to defend ourselves against those who seek us harm and deliver justice to those responsible for the attacks against our people, has never once faltered.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:40)', 'Speech': 'It took 10 years hunt down and kill Osama Bin Laden, but we did. And this summer I authorized a successful strike on Zawahiri, the man who’d Bin Laden, was his deputy at 9/11, who was the leader of Al-Qaeda. Because we will not rest. We’ll never forget. We’ll never give up. And now Zawahiri can never again threaten the American people in 20 years, after Afghanistan is over. But our commitment to preventing another attack to the United States is without end. Our intelligence and defense and counter terrorism professionals, in the building behind me and across the government, continue their vigilance against terrorist threats that has evolved and spread to new regions of the world. We’ll continue to monitor and disrupt those terrorist activities wherever we find them, wherever they exist and we’ll never hesitate to do what’s necessary to defend the American people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:43)', 'Speech': 'What was destroyed, we have repaired. What was threatened, we fortified. What was attacked, the indomitable spirit has never ever wavered. We raised monuments and memorials to the citizens whose blood sacrificed on these grounds and then Shanksville and Ground Zero, to keep touch of the memory, keep it bright for all the decades to come. When future generations come here to sit in the shade of the maple trees that shelter the memorial grown tall and strong with passing years, they’ll find the names of patriots. They will feel the connection. They will come to pass on September 11th, 2001 and how our country was forever changed. And I hope they’ll think about all those heroes that were more in the hours and days and years as followed. Ordinary Americans responding in extraordinary and unexpected ways.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:54)', 'Speech': 'I hope we’ll remember that in the midst of these dark days, we dug deep, we cared for each other and we came together. We regained the light by reaching out to one another and finding something all too rare, a true sense of national unity. To me, that’s the greatest lesson of September 11. Not that we will never again face a setback, but that in the moment of great unity, we also had to face down the worst impulses, fear, violence, recrimination directed against Muslim Americans, as well as Americans of Middle Eastern and South Asian heritage.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:45)', 'Speech': 'It’s that for all our flaws and disagreements in the push and pull of all that makes us human, there’s nothing this nation cannot accomplish when we stand together and defend with all our hearts that which makes us unique in the world, our democracy. We’re not only a nation based on principles, but we are based on an idea. We’re a most unique nation in the world. An idea that everyone was created equal and should be treated equally throughout their lives. We don’t always live up to it, but we’ve never walked away from it. That’s what makes us strong. That’s what makes us who we are. And that’s what those hijackers most hope to destroy when they targeted our buildings and our people. They failed.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:42)', 'Speech': 'No terrorists could touch the well spring of American power and it falls to us to keep it safe on behalf of all those we lost 21 years ago. On behalf of all those who have given their whole souls to the cause of this nation every day since. That’s a job for all of us. It’s not enough to gather and remember each September 11th and those we lost more than two decades ago. Because on this day, it is not about the past, it’s about the future. We have an obligation, a duty, a responsibility to defend, preserve, and protect our democracy. The very democracy that guarantees the rights of freedom that those terrorists on 9/11 sought to bury in the burning fire and smoke and ash.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:33)', 'Speech': 'And that takes a commitment on the part of all of us. Dedication, hard work, every day. For always remember, the American democracy depends on the habits of the heart of we the people. That’s how our constitution, we the people. And the habits are hard of we the people. It’s not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then, it’s something we have to do every single day. So this is a day not only to remember, but a day of renewal and resolve for each and every American in our devotion of this country to the principles it embodies, to our democracy. That is who we owe those who we remember today. That is what we owe one another. And that is what we owe future generations of Americans to come.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:37)', 'Speech': 'I have no doubt we will do this. We will meet this significant responsibility. We’ll secure our democracy together, as one America, the United States of America. That’s who we are. That’s who your loved ones were and why they gave so much. Thank you. May God bless you all and may God honor the members of the military we lost and all those we lost here on 9/11. May God protect our troops.'}]"

On behalf of my family and the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, welcome to this historic day. On the 60th anniversary of President Kennedy’s Moonshot speech, we’re honored to welcome President Biden as he announces his own administration’s Cancer Moonshot for the 21st century. This is also a special day for me personally because it’s the day that my parents were married 69 years ago.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (00:31)', 'Speech': 'We’re so happy to have Mayor Wu, Mayor Landrieu, Senator Markey, Administrator Becerra, Governor Baker, Secretary Walsh, and so many members of the Massachusetts delegation with us. We’re grateful for your support of the library over many years. I know that many of you and the state and local officials here worked closely with my Uncle Teddy, for the good of this Commonwealth, and that you all share my father’s love of politics.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (01:06)', 'Speech': 'I want to recognize members of the medical community who are here, physicians, researchers, cancer survivors, students, you all save lives and bring hope and healing to patients and families suffering from cancer. I want to thank Sheetal for the inspiration that you provide not just to those living with cancer, but all those who are working for a cleaner, healthier world. And I want to thank the members of my family who are here. My cousins, your families, all of you carry on your parents’ work. And all of you carry on our love of Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (01:42)', 'Speech': 'And I especially want to thank my husband, Ed, my daughter, Tatiana, and my son, Jack for being here, especially Jack who welcomed us. He always shows up for this library and for me, no matter what, not just on the public days, but every day. I learned from Teddy that it’s more fun to do things with family. So I’m grateful to Jack for always making this work fun.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (02:05)', 'Speech': 'A few years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the moon landing and the world was captivated by the memory of that event. But almost more remarkable was that such a historic national achievement was set in motion by a single speech. When President Kennedy gave his speech at Rice University, the United States had only four short manned space flights, the longest less than five hours. President Eisenhower and Cold War experts said we should concentrate on developing satellites and missiles to beat the Soviets instead of going to the moon. And there were other reasons not to do it. It was expensive, eventually costing 4% of GDP, and a time when many said the money would be better spent on building infrastructure, fighting poverty, and addressing other social problems, not to mention the necessary materials had not yet been invented and scientists weren’t sure even that a moon landing on the surface of the moon was possible.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (03:12)', 'Speech': 'But President Kennedy understood the power of the idea. And over time, along with his inaugural address’ call to service, the Moonshot speech has become perhaps his best known legacy. The vision, the purpose, the courage it embodied has inspired each generation to take on hard challenges, and provides a metaphor to guide us as we face adversity in our own lives. My father believed that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in America, that everyone would contribute, that it would require invention, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith, and that the world would be different because of it. He didn’t live to see it, but he set in motion an age of discovery and invention, of earth science and space exploration, that has made America the leader of the world.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (04:05)', 'Speech': 'As citizens, as colleagues, as friends, we can learn from his vision. It’s up to each of us to set an example to do hard things when we don’t think we can, to believe in others when they take risks, to support them when it’s tough. And never forget that together, we can achieve great things. No one embodies that spirit more than President Joe Biden. He’s lived President Kennedy’s call to service throughout his life and career. As President, he has restored the soul of America, advanced freedom and democracy around the world. For more than 50 years, President Biden has been fighting for working families, affordable health care, access to a quality education, and always, to honor our men and women in uniform.'}, {'Time': 'Ambassador Caroline: (04:58)', 'Speech': 'But perhaps the most personal fight for him is the one against cancer. As Vice President he launched his own moonshot to end cancer as we know it, and with characteristic perseverance, he’s still committed to that cause. Like the Bidens, like all families, our family has lost people we love to this disease, including three who created and sustained this library: my Uncle Steve, my mother, and my Uncle Teddy, and I want to remember them today. Having felt the grief that comes with such loss, I’ve often looked at President Biden’s life for inspiration. His courage and compassion, his endless empathy and abiding faith, and his confidence that we can overcome this challenge have lifted our hearts. His personal commitment and the national goal he sets today will save lives, change our country, and heal the world. I’m honored to serve in his administration and to introduce him now. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:00)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Madam Ambassador. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Madam Ambassador Caroline, thank you for that introduction and for your enduring friendship.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:32)', 'Speech': 'I was talking earlier about how your family, at a very difficult time in my life, when I first got to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid, before I was sworn in, I lost my wife and my daughter, and my two boys were so badly injured when struck by a tractor trailer. And your family was there for me. No, I really mean it. Your family was there for me. You may remember some of it. And I’ll never forget it. They got me and my boys through an awful lot.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:02)', 'Speech': 'I’m truly honored to be with you all and your incredible family. And, Jack, I believe your generation is the best-educated, most talented generation in our history. And that’s the reason I’m so optimistic about the future, and that’s not hyperbole. I mean it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:21)', 'Speech': 'Sheetal, thank you for sharing your powerful story. And thank you, Mayor Wu, for the passport into this great city. And thank you to Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra and Boston’s own Marty Walsh. Marty.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:43)', 'Speech': 'And thank you to the members of the Massachusetts delegation from the House: Representatives Pressley, Lynch, Keating, and Jack. Jake, I should say. Auchincloss and Lori, thank you as well for being here.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:03)', 'Speech': 'And Laurie, thank you as well for being here. You have beautiful daughters, they’re great kids. And I want to thank all of you, the cancer patients, survivors, caregivers, and don’t jump from up there, okay? And for all the leaders of science and medicine for being here today, this is a powerful place for reflection and remembrance. On this day in 1962, America was facing an inflection point, one of those times that changes everything from the day before, to the day after. The shadow of world wars cast over a Cold War, the March on civil rights, urgent, yet uncertain and against all of that and more, America faced the choice to move forward or to move backwards. To build the future or obsess about the past, to be nation of unity and hope, an optimism or a nation of division violence in hatred at this inflection point, President Kennedy made a choice for the nation. Thank God. On this day in 1962 at Grace University in Houston, he spoke about America’s possibilities. I was asked by Xi Xinping, who I met with more than any other world leader in the Tibetan Plateau. And he turned to me and he said, “Can you define America for me?” And I said, “Yes.” And I was sincere. I said, “One word: possibilities. In America, we believe anything is possible.”'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:43)', 'Speech': 'And I mean it. And in choosing to go to the moon, President Kennedy said America was doing so, “Not because it was easy, but because it was hard.” Because the goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energy and skills. Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win. Unwilling to postpone, President Kennedy, unwilling to postpone. President Kennedy set a goal to win the space race against Russia, and advance science and technology for all of humanity. And when he set that goal, he established the national purpose that could rally the American people in a common cause. And he succeeded.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:47)', 'Speech': 'Now in our time on the 60th anniversary of his Clarion call, we face another inflection point and together we can choose to move forward with unity, hope and optimism. And I believe we can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone, the same national purpose that will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills to end cancer as we know it, and even cure cancers once and for all. I gave you my word as a Biden, this cancer moonshot is one of the reasons why I ran for President, it’s part of my unity agenda that I laid out in my state of the union address to rally the American people to work together. Because we know this: cancer does not discriminate red and blue. It doesn’t care if you’re a Republican or a Democrat. Beating cancer is something we can do together and that’s why I’m here today.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:14)', 'Speech': 'We’ve made enormous progress in the past 50 years since President Nixon signed the National Cancer Act to declare a war on cancer. We learned cancer is not a single disease, but there are over 200 different types of cancers caused by different genetic mutations in our cells. We discovered new medicines, therapies, early detection of prevention measures to extend and to save lives. In the first 25 years since the National Cancer Act, the death rate from cancer largely remained unchanged. Then things began to change with progress over the last 25 years, the death rate from cancer has fallen more than 25%, but despite the progress of lives extended, lives saved, cancer is still the number two cause of death in America, second only to heart disease. For too many cancer patients and their families, instead of hope, there’s bewilderment the feeling of being on your own, frustration that hospitals said, doctors can’t easily share your medical records with other hospitals and doctors help find answers even when every minute counts. Having to advocate for even the most basic care and attention for your loved ones.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:43)', 'Speech': 'The flood of information is a completely different language with few people, help and available to help you decipher it. Having therapy that could work within reach, but it’s too expensive where insurance won’t cover it. And so, when President Obama asked me to launch a cancer moonshot, our goal was to bring an added urgency, a new urgency to the fight. And in my view, not unlike President Kennedy did. We harnessed federal resources to change the culture, increase cooperation, and break down the silos that exist, that included everything we’re making published results of federally funded cancer research more available to any patient, to any doctor, for free instead of the firewall that had been set up. That included recognition for many cancer patients. It’s hard to even know if there’s a clinical trial that can help them let alone how to enroll in one.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:49)', 'Speech': 'So we launched trials.cancer.gov, so everyone can find a clinical trial near them, or across the country, and the world and they can gain access to these trials. I’ve traveled the country, brought together leaders in healthcare, technology, education, business, philanthropy. I visited many of the major cancer research centers in the world and nowhere, no matter where I was or what the topic at hand, world leaders wanted to talk to me about our cancer moonshot. That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. For example, Pope Francis convened to major international conference on cell therapies at the Vatican and invited me to speak about our mission. And one of the final pieces of legislation President Obama signed in the law was the bipartisan 21st Century CURES Act. It streamlined the food and drug administration, the FDA by creating an oncology center of excellence so new cancer treatments can be evaluated faster. It provided seven years of new funding, including research-'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:03)', 'Speech': 'Divided. Seven years of new funding, including research on cancer therapies, and the disparities. Trial networks to discover new drugs, and new efforts in childhood cancer. As President of the United States Senate, I presided over the overwhelming bipartisan vote, and watched my friend Mitch McConnell named the cancer provisions in that bill after my son Beau, would had lost his life to that disease just months earlier.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:31)', 'Speech': 'And when we left office, Jill and I knew we had to keep going through, keep it up. So we initiated the Biden Cancer Initiative. We focused on turning the moonshot into a movement, not just a shot of movement. To create a cancer research and care system that most people think we already have, but they don’t realize until they find they have cancer that we don’t, but one that we deserve. And everywhere we’d go, people would share their stories, literally. In grocery stores, airports, rope lines. While we heard stories of loss and despair, the stories began to change to a feeling of real hope. Not because of me or Jill, but because of all of you, and so many of you at home. Doctors, researchers, advocates, caregivers, patients, survivors.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:27)', 'Speech': 'And that’s when I was elected president I determined to supercharge the cancer moonshot as a central effort in the Biden/Harris administration. In February, I laid out our plan that is bold, ambitious, and I might add, completely doable. The goal is to cut cancer death rates by at least 50%, at least 50%, in the next 25 years. To turn more cancers from death sentences, into chronic diseases people can live with. To create more supportive experience for patients and families, and to update our fight against the cancer. It’s a disease we often diagnose too late, and have too few ways to prevent it in the first place. Where there are stark inequities based on race, disability, zip code, sexual orientation, gender identity, and other factors.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:28)', 'Speech': 'We know too little about why treatments work for some patients, but the different patient with the same disease it doesn’t work for. We still lack strategies for developing treatments for some cancers, like childhood cancers. We don’t do enough to help patients and families navigate the cancer care system. We don’t learn enough from their experience as patients. We don’t share enough data, and knowledge, to bring the urgency we need to finding new answers. But for each of the ways we know cancer today, we know we can change the trajectory.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:12)', 'Speech': 'For example, to prevent cancers, scientists are exploring whether mRNA vaccine technology that brought us safe and effective COVID 19 vaccines could be used to stop cancer cells when they first arise. To target the right treatments. We’re learning more about how to use genetics, immune response, and other factors to tell which combinations of treatments are likely to work best for each individual. To address inequities, we can ensure prevention, detection, treatment, reach patients in urban, rural, suburban, and tribal communities, so they have equal access to cancer diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical trials.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:02)', 'Speech': 'As part of the supercharged moonshot, I’ll use my authorities as president to increase funding, to break log jams and to speed breakthroughs. I’ve also formed a new cancer cabinet that’s driving a whole of government effort to unleash every possible asset within our power, from NASA that knows more about radiation than a doctor does, to the defense department that has the ability to calculate, and an energy department to a million billion calculations per second. Health and human services. Secretary Becerra plays a key role in the cancer cabinet. As does Marty Walsh, the child childhood cancer survivor, who is committed to helping Americans get time off for cancer screenings, or care for a loved one.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:50)', 'Speech': 'White House office of science and technology policy is changing the path for the cancer moonshot for 2022 and beyond. And today I’m setting a long term goal for the cancer moon shot to rally America, and ingenuity that we can engage like we did to reach the moon, that actually cures cancers, not all cancer. Cancers. Cures for cancers once and for all, and a critical way to do that is that going through what I call ARPA-H. Advanced research projects agencies for health. It’s based on DARPA, the defense department’s advanced research projects agency, that has helped lead to breakthroughs in technologies to protect our national security, like the internet, GPS, and so much more. ARPA-H will have the singular purpose to drive breakthroughs, to prevent, detect, and treat diseases, including cancer Alzheimer’s diabetes and other diseases enable us to live healthier lives. I called for ARPA-H in our campaign, and after being elected president now withstanding the fact that Democrats and Republicans allegedly don’t talk to one another, Republicans, independents and Democrats in Congress came together and invested $1 billion initially to launch ARPA-H. Imagine the possibilities. Vaccines that could prevent cancer, like there is for HPV. Imagine molecular zip codes that could deliver drugs and gene therapy precisely to the right tissues. Imagine simple blood tests during an annual physical that could detect cancer early, with the chance of cure or best. Imagine getting a simple shot instead of a grueling chemo, or getting a pill from a local pharmacy instead of invasive treatment, and long hospital stays. Imagine treatments beyond cancer. Bold approaches to reduce maternal mortality morbidity, something Vice President Harris is laser focused on. And imagine artificial retina that could help blind people see. These are just a few of the ideas to illustrate the amazing potential of ARPA-H.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:18)', 'Speech': 'When president Kennedy called for a moonshot, we didn’t have all the tools and experience needed. With our cancer moonshot today, we do. And I’m pleased to announce my selection as the inaugural director ARPA-H, Dr. Renee Wegrzyn, who is here today. Doctor, where are you? Stand up. A leading biomedical scientist, a decade of experience leading multiple biotechs project at DARPA. And by the way, it’s about how to use all the assets we have. All of them. An-'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': '… the assets we have. All of them. An entrepreneur in synthetic biology says you’re going to bring the legendary DARPA attitude and culture and boldness of risk taking to ARPA-H to fill a critical need. Discoveries that save lives, change lives and often start … They often start in the lab bench. But then those basic research breakthrough need to be tested, scaled, and brought to the clinic. This may require unusual partnerships that may require support to get over many obstacles that exist. That’s why ARPA-H is designed what it’s designed to do. So the advances can reach all Americans sooner. I predict ARPA-H will emerge as a new and exciting member of America’s biomedical ecosystem.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:52)', 'Speech': 'But it’s not enough to invent technologies to save lives. We need to manufacture advanced bio technologies here in the United States. That’s why today I sign an executive order that directs the federal government to ensure bio technologies invented in the United States of America are made in the United States America, whether they’re for cancer treatments or anything else like next generation fuels and materials. Today’s action is going to ensure that America leads the world in biotechnology and bio manufacturing. Creating jobs, reducing prices, strengthening supply chains, so we don’t have to rely on anywhere else in the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:39)', 'Speech': 'Here in America it’ll be made. And there’s more that we’re doing. The Inflation Reduction Act that I signed in the law puts a $2,000 cap on the total prescription drug cost for any senior on Medicare, including cancer medicine. And for so many people, one of the first things they think about when they get a diagnosis, “How am I going to pay for the treatment? Do we need to sell the house? Do we need to skip payments on the car? Can we afford to send the kids to college?” Inflation Reduction Act is a godsend. It’s going to save people on one prostate cancer drug about $6,000 a year. Thousands of women are taking breast cancer treatments that will see about a $7,000 a year savings. But that’s not all. When I led the Cancer Moonshot as vice president one of the biggest issues I talked about was how federally funded cancer researchers were not sharing their results with their peers or the public because they wanted to have the answer. You all know it. As I mentioned earlier, we made federally funded cancer research more available to any patient, to any doctor, anywhere, for free. And today as president we’re making sure that transparency applies to all federally funded science beyond just cancer. And this summer I announced the new head of the National Cancer Institute, Boston’s own, Boston’s own, Monica Bertagnolli. Excuse me. Monica, you can call me Bidden. And she’s here today. Where are you, Monica? Stand up. Thank you. The National Cancer Institute is launching a major national trial for those new tests I mentioned that could detect one or more cancers merely by taking blood samples. If that’s the case, these blood tests could lead to less invasive cancer detection tools that will save lives. We’re also launching the first ever Cancer Moonshot Scholar program to support a new generation of scientists from every background, from every part of the country to launch their cutting edge research and careers. But we need everyone to get in the game. That’s why I’m also calling on the science and medical communities to bring the boldest thinking to this fight. I’m calling on the private sector to develop and test new treatments, make drugs more affordable, share more data and knowledge that can inform the public and benefit every company’s research. And I’m respectfully calling on people living with cancer and caregivers and families to keep sharing their experience and pushing for progress. Go to White house.gov/cancermoonshot. Share your ideas. So many of you have already made a difference.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:52)', 'Speech': 'Last month I signed the so-called PACT Act in the law. One of the most significant laws helping veterans in their families impacted by toxic exposure like burn pits that lead to cancer. It was veterans and their families, advocates and allies who helped me get this bill to my desk. They never gave up. They never stopped. They slept on the Capitol steps. It matters. It’s personal to all of us. So let me close with this. Caroline, I couldn’t be here and not talk about your Uncle Teddy. He was one of my dearest friends. One of the things that brings us close as families, the dreaded cancer that he and my Bo fought to the end and died months apart. After Bo passed, Vicky wrote me a letter about how after Ted lost his older brother, Joe, his father wrote to a friend who just lost son.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (29:58)', 'Speech': 'Caroline, your grandfather wrote and I quote, “When one of your loved one goes out of your life, you think of what he might have done with a few more years and you wonder what you are going to do with the rest of yours. Then one day, because there’s a world to be lived in, you find you are part of it trying to accomplish something, something he did not have time enough to do. And perhaps that is reason for it all. I hope so.” End of quote.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:36)', 'Speech': 'For so many of us, that’s what we’re trying to do, live a life worthy of the loved ones we’ve lost and the loved ones we can save. With our hope and absolute courage, and with the unwillingness to postpone and with a singular purpose for ourselves as and as a nation. President Kennedy said on this day 60 years ago, “We set sail on this new sea because of new lifesaving knowledge to be gained that must be used for progress of all people.” End of quote. And our time today, that’s our charge to keep in my view. I know we can do this together because I know this, there’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity, if we work together as the United States of America. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening.'}]"

As you might guess, I am very pleased to announce a tentative labor agreement that had been reached between the railroad workers and the railway companies. This agreement is a big win for America, and for both in my view. I want to thank the lead negotiators from the labor movement, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers Union, and the other labor unions engaged. And this is a win for tens of thousands of rail workers and for their dignity and the dignity of their work. It’s a recognition of that.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:41)', 'Speech': 'During these early dark uncertain days of the pandemic they showed up so every American could keep going. They worked tirelessly through the pandemic to ensure that families and communities got the deliveries they needed during these difficult few years. And because of the labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay, 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their healthcare by capping the cost that workers will have to pay. And it’s about the right to go to a doctor or stay healthy to make sure you’re able to have the care you can afford. It’s all part of this agreement. They earned and deserve these benefits.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:28)', 'Speech': 'And this is a great deal for both sides in my view. The agreement is also a victory for railway companies. And I want to thank the lead negotiators from the National Railway Labor Conference and our major rail companies. These companies also played a critical role in keeping America moving during the pandemic, and that’s not hyperbole it’s a fact. With this agreement, railroad companies will be able to retain and recruit workers, they’ll be able to continue to operate effectively as a vital piece of our economy. They’re really the backbone of the economy. I have this visual image of rails being the backbone. I mean literally the backbone of the economy. So, I thank the unions and the rail companies for negotiating good faith. They’ve been up for 20 straight hours through that negotiation and for sticking with it, especially over the last few days.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:19)', 'Speech': 'In fact, the negotiators here today I don’t think they’ve been to bed yet, so I don’t want to keep this very long and they’re having a stand [inaudible 00:02:28]. Together you reached an agreement that will keep our critical rail system working and avoid disruptions of our economy. And I’m grateful, grateful for members of administration to work tirelessly on both sides to help get this done. I especially want to thank Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, card carrying union member and the first union labor secretary in decades for his tireless [inaudible 00:02:52].'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:56)', 'Speech': 'This agreement is validation. Validation, what I’ve always believed, unions and management can work together, can work together for the benefit of everyone. They’re traveling now a number of them up, but I want to thank Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who were deeply involved. Along with, I want to thank Deputy Labor Secretary Julie Su, Director of National Economic Council Brian Deese, and the Deputy National Director of Labor Celeste Drake for this commitment and hard work.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:30)', 'Speech': 'To the American people, this agreement can aver a significant damage that any shutdown would’ve brought. Our nation’s rail system is the backbone of our supply chain. Everything you rely on. And it’s hard to realize this from everything from clean water to food to gas, I mean liquified natural gas, to every good that you need seems to end on a rail getting delivered to where it needs to go. With unemployment still on record lows and signs of progress and lowering costs, this agreement allows us to continue to rebuild a better America with an economy that truly works for working people and their families. Today is a win, I mean it sincerely, a win for America. So I want to thank you all for getting this done, both business and labor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And may God protect our troops.

Growing crisis in foods insecurity; record heat; floods and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war, a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:29)', 'Speech': 'Let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor; attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenants of the United Nations charter, no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:59)', 'Speech': 'Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. Now Russia’s calling up more soldiers to join the fight, and the Kremlin is organizing a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine: an extremely significant violation of the UN charter.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (01:33)', 'Speech': 'This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened, but no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict. In fact, we warned it was coming, and with many of you, we worked to try to avert it. Putin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable. Just before he invaded, Putin asserted, and I quote, Ukraine was created by Russia and never had “real statehood”.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:16)', 'Speech': 'And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals. One on centers of Ukrainian history and culture. In the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those who excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (02:46)', 'Speech': 'This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold. That’s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:19)', 'Speech': 'The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid, and direct economic support for Ukraine, more than $25 billion to date. Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well, and today more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (03:49)', 'Speech': 'The United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes, because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything. Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers, but this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate. We chose liberty. We chose sovereignty. We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding. We stood with Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (04:39)', 'Speech': 'Like you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we’re all signed up for: that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by force. The only country standing in the way of that is Russia. So we, each of us in this body, who are determined to uphold the principles and beliefs, we pledge to defend as members of the United Nations; must be clear, firm and unwavering in our resolve.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:16)', 'Speech': 'Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression, period. Now, it’s no secret in the contest between democracy autocracy, the United States, and I as President, champion a vision for our world that’s grounded in the values of democracy. The United States is determined to defend its strength in democracy at home and around the world, because I believe democracy remains humanity’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (05:58)', 'Speech': 'We’re working with the G7 and like-minded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens, but also deliver for the rest of the world as well. But as we meet today, the UN charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage. And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world. It was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to work for peace.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:43)', 'Speech': 'As President Truman said in 1945, the UN Charter and I quote, “is proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them and then can find common ground on which to stand.” End of quote. That common ground was so straightforward, so basic, that today 193 of you, 193 member states, have willingly embraced his principles, and standing up for those principles for the UN charter is the job of every responsible member state.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:22)', 'Speech': 'I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed. To stand against global politics of fear and coercion, to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones, to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, respect for international law and arms control; no matter what else we may disagree on, that Is the common ground upon which we must stand. If you’re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:03)', 'Speech': '… of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you. I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that they can better respond to the needs of today’s world. Members of the UN security council, including the United States should consistently uphold and defend the UN charter and refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure the council remains credible and effective. That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the council. This includes permanent seats for those nations we’ve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:51)', 'Speech': 'The United States is committed to this vital work. In every region, we’ve pursued new constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interest, from elevating the quad in the Indo-Pacific, to signing the Los Angeles declaration of migration and protection at the summit of the Americas to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful integrated Middle East, to hosting the US-Africa leader summit in this December.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:22)', 'Speech': 'As I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives, all people’s lives. Tackling climate crisis, as a previous spoke speaker spoke to. Strengthening global health security, feeding the world. Feeding the world. We made that priority and one year later we’re keeping that promise. From the day I came to office, we’ve led with bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement, convened the major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on the COP 26. We helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:09)', 'Speech': 'And now I’ve signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country. $369 billion toward climate change. That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean manufacturing, our department of energy estimates that this new law will reduce US emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean energy powered economic growth. Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide, not just in the United States.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:03)', 'Speech': 'This is a global game changer and none too soon. We don’t have much time. We all know we’re already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. We meet [inaudible 00:11:21] much of Pakistan is still underwater, needs help. Meanwhile, the horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they’ll survive. This is the human cost of climate change and it’s growing, not lessening. So as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our congress deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance, to help lower income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition. The key part of that will be our PEPFAR plan, which will help half a billion people and especially vulnerable countries, adopt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. This need is enormous. So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation, and unlock a resilient, sustainable clean energy economy to preserve our planet.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (12:42)', 'Speech': 'On global health, we’ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID 19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world with more available to help meet countries’ needs. All free of charge, no strings attached, and we’re working closely with the G20 and other countries and the United States help lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new fund for pandemic prevention preparedness and response at the World Bank. At the same time, we’ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges. Later today, I’ll host the seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to fight aids, tuberculosis, and malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:38)', 'Speech': 'So I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all history. We’re also taking down the food crisis, head on. With as many as 193 million people around the world experience acute, acute food insecurity. A jump of 40 million in a year. Today I’m announcing another $2.9 billion in US support for life saving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone. Russia in the meantime is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis, the food crisis on the sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine. So let me be perfectly clear about something. Our sanctions explicitly allow, explicitly allow, Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:53)', 'Speech': 'I’m grateful for the work here at the UN, including your leadership, Mr. Secretary General, establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months. And we need to make sure it’s extended. We believe strongly in the need to feed the world. That’s why the United States is the world largest support of the World Food Program with more than 40% of its budget. We’re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world. To take on a larger challenge of food insecurity in the United States introduced to call to action, a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity … To eliminating global food insecurity that more than a hundred nation member states have already supported. In June the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world. Through USAID’s Feed The Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought and heat resistant …'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:04)', 'Speech': '… this is scaling up innovative ways to get drought and heat resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them. While distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency, that farmers can grow more while using less.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:16)', 'Speech': 'And we’re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering. Because in every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing, nothing else matters if parents cannot feed their children.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:39)', 'Speech': 'As we look to the future, we’re working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st century. We launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologies, key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:02)', 'Speech': 'With our partner countries and through the UN we’re supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility, responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyber attacks to threaten international peace and security.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:20)', 'Speech': 'With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific, we’re working to build a new economic ecosystem where every nation, every nation gets a fair shot in economic growth that is resilient, sustainable and shared.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:37)', 'Speech': 'That’s why the United States is championing a global minimum tax. And we will work to see it implemented, so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere. Everywhere.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:50)', 'Speech': 'It’s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies. We’re working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific islands to support a vision for a critical Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:12)', 'Speech': 'Together with partners around the world, we’re working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination. And ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:27)', 'Speech': 'And as Russia’s war riles the global economy, we’re also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:48)', 'Speech': 'Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let’s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments, high standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment, key to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:10)', 'Speech': 'That’s why the United States together with fellow G7 partners launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027. Dozens of projects are already underway, industrial scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola, first of its kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania. These are investments that are going to deliver returns, not just for those countries, but for everyone.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:48)', 'Speech': 'The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve global problems like climate change. Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation. And walking away hurts the entire world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:07)', 'Speech': 'Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China. As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner. But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations. Investments that are designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient. Partnerships, not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success, each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well. When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:08)', 'Speech': 'Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution, increasing peace and security for everyone everywhere. The United States will not waiver on our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world. And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:32)', 'Speech': 'We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. We remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades. And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side. We support an African Union led peace process to end the fighting in Ethiopia, and restore security for all its people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:54)', 'Speech': 'In Venezuela, where years of political oppression have driven more than six million people from that country. We urge the Venezuelan led dialogue and return to free and fair elections. We continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political fueled gang violence and enormous human crisis. And we call on the world to do the same. We have more to do.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:19)', 'Speech': 'We’ll continue to back the UN mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of war. And we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiated peace between the Jewish and Democratic State of Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States is committed to Israel’s security full stop. And a negotiated two state solution remains in our view the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state to which they are entitled. Both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens. Both people enjoying an equal measure of freedom and dignity.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:08)', 'Speech': 'Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non proliferation regime through diplomacy. No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures. A nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:35)', 'Speech': 'The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January. But today we’re seeing disturbing trends. Russia shunned the non proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference. And again, today, as I said, they’re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons …'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:03)', 'Speech': '… Making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons. China is conducting an unprecedented concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency. Despite our efforts to begin seriously sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate UN sanctions. While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the joint comprehensive plan of action, if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear. We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:37)', 'Speech': 'I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. The non-proliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution. We cannot let the world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights. Perhaps singular among this body’s achievements stands the universal declaration of human rights, which is the standard by which our forebearers challenge us to measure ourselves.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:09)', 'Speech': 'They made clear in 1948 human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve. And yet today in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations in Xinjiang, detailed recent reports by the office of UN and US, reports detailing, by the US high commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Today we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran, who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:02)', 'Speech': 'But here’s what I know the future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies, where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities, where the LGBTQ+ community, individuals, live and love freely without being targeted with violence, where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal. The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the UN Charter and our own country and around the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:55)', 'Speech': 'Let me end with this. This institution, guided by the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at its core an act of dauntless hope. Let me say that again. It’s an act of dauntless hope.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:15)', 'Speech': 'Think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smoldering. Think about how divided the people of the world must have felt, with the fresh grief of millions dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:39)', 'Speech': 'They had every right to believe only the worst of humanity. Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us. And they strove to build something better, enduring peace, comity among nations, equal rights for every member of the human family, cooperation for the advancement of all humankind. My fellow leaders, the challenge we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment must be greater still. So let’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the UN Charter, that we still believe by working together, we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:36)', 'Speech': 'We’re not passive witnesses to history. We are the authors of history. We can do this. We have to do it for ourselves and for our future, for humankind. Thank you for your tolerance, for listening to me. I appreciate it very much. God bless you all.'}]"

Wow, what a beautiful day for this. Thank you and welcome to the White House. You know it’s wonderful to be with so many friends here today. The story of the disability community of all of you, is a story fearlessness and resilience. It’s the story of tireless dedication and overcoming incredible obstacles, both figurative and concrete. Who could forget the image of then, eight year old Jennifer Keelan-Chaffins leaving her wheelchair behind, to crawl up the congressional steps, along with dozens of other disability rights activists. Showing the world what it was like to be denied access to the people’s Capital. Because of the work of thousands of courageous people like Jennifer, who refused to be silent about the indignities that they faced, who built coalitions and unified advocates, unions, and civil rights leaders, who held onto the hope of a better way.'}, {'Time': 'First Lady Dr Jill Biden: (01:18)', 'Speech': 'The Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law 32 years ago. This community continues to shape our nation, crafting our laws and dismantling injustice, penning our poetry and painting our dreams, teaching our children, and pushing the frontiers of our future. So you all probably know I’m an English teacher. Maybe there’s some English teachers in the audience. So I want to end with the words of the advocate and poet, Susan Mazrui. She wrote… And here she is. Stand up, Susan. Yes. All right, these are your words, “We are not the problem. We are problem solvers. We have changed the world. Tomorrow we fight the inequity that remains. Tonight, we celebrate disability, the power, and the pride.”'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (02:52)', 'Speech': 'Woo.'}, {'Time': 'First Lady Dr Jill Biden: (02:52)', 'Speech': 'Pretty good. You all have changed the world, and that’s why we’re here today. We are honored to celebrate your power and your pride. So now, please join me in welcoming a leader who is working tirelessly to build on our progress, Mayor Tim Adams.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (03:25)', 'Speech': 'Do you need some help? There you go.'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Tim Adams: (03:43)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr President. Thank you, Dr Biden. Greetings, distinguished guests. I am humbled and deeply honored to be here today with you, talking about a topic that is so critical to me and to the lives of so many others. In 1990, when the Americans with Disabilities Act became law, I was a young man. I had just started my business the previous year. My thoughts and my attention were focused on keeping my business afloat and making my way in the world. Everything changed for me in 2003, as I suffered an incomplete spinal cord injury, that left me a paraplegic in the electric chair, as my mode of mobility. But I learned that the American with Disabilities Act was a lifeline for me and others like me. By codifying the right to equal opportunities, independence and economic self-sufficiency, it ensured that I could still open doors or move down the sidewalk on my own, and that I would continue to be in the room and be part of the discussions and the opportunities for my business to grow.'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Tim Adams: (05:04)', 'Speech': 'When I think about where we are as a country, and I think about being a disabled person, I use three words to describe the situation. Creativity. My disability means that sometimes I can’t do things in the same way as others do. I have to adapt and to be creative in accomplishing tasks that others take for granted. The ADA has allowed us to imagine a world where adaptations are possible for all. Ingenuity. This goes hand in hand with creativity. Technological advances have given me mobility and independence. This state of the art modernized wheelchair and the electric ramp that lowers it out of my van weren’t always an option for people like us.'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Tim Adams: (05:58)', 'Speech': 'The ADA fostered invention and transformed existing technologies into solutions for those who couldn’t see or hear or were limited in their mobility, and productivity. I was able to grow my small business into a national business that it is today, because I could work. You see, I could travel, build relationships, get funding, meet people where they were, because there were true mobility solutions for me. And yes, I have to say, I was able to move forward with the dream of becoming the Mayor of the City of Bowie, one of the largest and most diverse cities in the state of Maryland.'}, {'Time': 'Mayor Tim Adams: (06:50)', 'Speech': 'Today, I’m delighted to be here celebrating the many, many life changing successes of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. After 33 years, it is as relevant and essential as it ever was, but the journey to equal access continues. There will be elevators that don’t work or are too small for a large motorized wheelchair, or handicapped parking spaces that won’t be painted properly so that a wheelchair can be lowered. But you know what? I am extremely grateful for the strong leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration, and I am deeply touched by the personal commitment that President Joe Biden has demonstrated to this cause, throughout his career. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct pleasure and great honor to introduce the President of the United States of America, the honorable Joe Biden, and to thank him personally, for all he has done for all of us with disabilities. Thank you. God bless you.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (08:07)', 'Speech': 'Mayor Adams, you’re an inspiration, and so many people here are. Tammy and others as I look out, you’re simply an inspiration to people not only with disabilities, but people who don’t have disabilities, who find themselves feeling sorry for themselves and realize, “Wait a minute. Wait, what am I complaining about?” And I enjoy Jill, welcoming all of you. I echo her welcome. And every time she stands up and speaks, I think about, “This is a woman who didn’t want to be involved in public life and speaking.” I wonder what in the hell she’s… I’m voting for her.'}, {'Time': 'First Lady Dr Jill Biden: (08:55)', 'Speech': 'I’m not running.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (09:02)', 'Speech': 'Tammy, it’s great to see you, kiddo. You’re not only a great, great Senator, but you’re really, genuinely a hero. You’re a war hero here. And Steny Hoyer, probably one of the most effective legislators in the last 40 years in the United States Congress, and a good friend. And Jim, you, you’re a pioneer in the House, 22 years. And if you wonder why there’s so many Secret Service around, they’re here to prevent you from retiring. Don’t go, I don’t want you to go. You’re the best pal. You’re the best. You really are. And I see a couple others out there. Who’s that guy sitting next to you? He’s new to the body. He knows about New York and bridges and all kinds of other things, but has also been an incredible supporter of the Disability Act.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:06)', 'Speech': 'We go back and remember guys like Bob Dole and others, don’t we pal, and who did so much. Look, I want to thank all the courageous advocates that are here. And there are a lot of advocates here, who’ve worked so hard to make our country more accessible and more just. Jill and I just wanted to host this celebration for two reasons. First, to celebrate Americans with Disabilities Act that our dear friend Tom Harkin of Iowa help write and pass 32 years ago.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (10:37)', 'Speech': 'And I was honored to be a co-sponsor. I take no credit for putting it together, Tom did all the heavy lifting, but I knew then, how important it was. And members of both parties. Both parties pressed through two administrations, led by a dear friend of mine, and many of us, the Republican leader, Bob Dole, and under President George H W Bush, signed into law, one of our most important civil rights laws ever. It’s hard for younger generations to imagine a world without the ADA. It’s just impossible. I’ll not mention his name, I shouldn’t go off script here, but not mention his name. But I remember one of the things that got me in real trouble one day as a young senator, I’d only been there a month and a half.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (11:25)', 'Speech': 'There was a senator standing up on the floor of the Senate, excoriating Bob Dole and Teddy Kennedy for a precursor for this legislation saying, “Why should you confiscate my money to put in a curb cut? Why should I have to pay for it?”, et cetera. And it really is something that you all, even those of you who are not here, who are here that are not disabled, you feel in your gut, there’s just a basic decency and fairness. And remember the days when, none of you are old enough in here, but remember the days when, if you were disabled, stores would turn you away. Employers could refuse to hire you. If you used a wheelchair, there was no required accommodation to take a bus that’s mentioned already, or a train to school or to work. America simply wasn’t built for all Americans, but we changed that. And now, for one in four Americans living with disability in America, we changed the law. It’s the key to equality, opportunity, independence. Tammy and Jim have both said, they wouldn’t be where they were today without the ADA.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (12:42)', 'Speech': 'They’ve made speeches about that, it matters. For our country, the ADA is a testament to the character of our people, to the country. It’s proof we could work together and keep moving closer to realizing the promise of America, for all Americans, for all Americans. And it’s proof of the power of our example, an American law that is a global model, inspiring 180 other nations to pass similar disability laws. And folks, the ADA advocate, Jim Dart, who was often recognized as the Godfather who wrote the ADA in 1990… He wrote in 1990, about the ADA. He said, “The ADA is only the beginning. It’s not a solution. It’s an essential foundation on which solutions will be constructed.” From day one, my administration has been building on the ADA Foundation. My Labor Department is protecting the rights of workers with disabilities, and fighting to end unjust sub-minimum wages.'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (13:46)', 'Speech': 'Woo.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (13:51)', 'Speech': 'That’s critical. When today, disabled Americans are still three times less likely than others to be employed, and often earn less for the same work that’s being done by others. We’re also creating a new job by helping state and local governments, employers and nonprofits tap federal funds to hire more disabled Americans. Our infrastructure law makes the biggest investment ever in accessible transit, updating subways, trains, and airports.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (14:25)', 'Speech': 'It expands access to high speed internet, a lifeline for people with disabilities to work, to study, to stay connected. And I know COVID 19 is hitting the disabilities community especially hard. The pain, the isolation, the separation, the toll on the mental and physical health of all people of the community, the loss of life. And on this day, we remember those lives lost and we thank everyone, everyone who is still… We think of them all, those are still hurting, those who are still struggling, including those living with long COVID. That’s why throughout the pandemic, we focused on increasing access to healthcare, to get us through this darkest of times. The American Rescue Plan provided $25 billion to states to expand home and community-based services under Medicaid.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (15:19)', 'Speech': 'So more people who have disabilities, can live independently at their home. We’ve delivered vaccines, masks, tests, therapeutics directly to people in their neighborhoods. We’ve mobilized a whole-of-government effort to advance our understanding of long COVID and accelerate progress and prevention, diagnosis and treatment. And I continue to call on Congress to provide the resources we need, to deal with COVID across the board. We followed up with the Inflation Reduction Act, one of the most significant laws in our history. One that will lower the cost of prescription drugs, healthcare, energy, and to make sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes. There’s more we’re doing. There’s more we’re doing to advance disability rights across the board, from increasing access to the ballot box, to promoting equity and inclusion around the world. All this is important progress. But the second reason we wanted to host this reception, is to acknowledge a movement that’s not just about disability rights, but also about disability pride.'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (16:32)', 'Speech': 'Woo.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (16:39)', 'Speech': 'It’s about recognizing, disability isn’t something broken to be fixed. For millions of Americans, their disability is a source of identity and power. Disability pride is about every Americans equal right, equal right to be recognized for who they are. It’s about celebrating the progress we’ve made and the future ahead. And one of the reasons I’m so optimistic about our future is because of our young people. They’re the most gifted, best educated, talented, and accepting generation in our history. And joining us today is one of the generations brightest lights. I’m going to turn it back to Jill to introduce him, but God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Jilly, the floor is yours.'}, {'Time': 'Audience: (17:23)', 'Speech': 'Woo.'}, {'Time': 'First Lady Dr Jill Biden: (17:31)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Born blind, Jose Andre Montano learned to play piano at just four years old. Today, at 17, he’s played festivals and concert halls across the world, including at the Kennedy Center where I heard him earlier this year. I was stunned by his music. It was incredible, and I couldn’t wait to bring him to the White House. Today, not only is he here with us, I’m excited to be joined by his parents as well, Roberto and Giovanna.'}, {'Time': 'President Joe Biden: (18:07)', 'Speech': 'Right there.'}, {'Time': 'First Lady Dr Jill Biden: (18:08)', 'Speech': 'Please welcome Jose Andre Montano.'}]"

Please welcome the US Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (00:18)', 'Speech': 'Good morning. Thank you very much. Welcome. It’s my privilege to open today’s conference and thank you all who have traveled across our great country to be here and to those who are participating virtually, who played a role in bringing this conference to life. A president once wrote the following, “The conference has significant responsibilities to explore and define our nutrition problems and to map out recommendations for an immediate program of action. During these days of stress, the health problems of the military and civilian population are inseparable. The full energy of every American is necessary. In recent years, scientists have made outstanding discoveries as to the amounts and kinds of foods needed for maximum health and vigor. Yet every survey of nutrition, by whatever means conducted, showed that undernourishment is widespread and serious.” That president was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in writing in an introduction to the 1941 National Nutrition Conference for Defense.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (01:23)', 'Speech': 'What was true in 1941 and in 1969 at the first White House conference on food, nutrition, and health is still true today. Food and nutrition security are central to our national security and to our economic future. The first White House conference on Food and Nutrition more than 50 years ago made significant progress towards reducing food insecurity.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (01:48)', 'Speech': 'Today, USDA runs nutrition assistance programs that serve one in four Americans every year. However, food and nutrition insecurity still remains unacceptably high. We also face a rising prevalence of disease related diet related diseases like Type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, which disproportionately impact underserved communities. There’s been progress. Food security among households with children is at its lowest point in two decades. I’m encouraged by this, but all of us in attendance today would agree that much more needs to be done.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (02:25)', 'Speech': 'This conference matters, and we should all thank Senators Booker and Bran, Chairman McGovern, and the late Congresswoman Linsky for their leadership in calling for this summit. And, of course, none of this would be possible without President Biden’s call for an all of government effort outlined in the National Strategy published yesterday, a national strategy crafted with the advice, guidelines, and input of hundreds of stakeholders from across the country.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (02:50)', 'Speech': 'Today, we’ll hear from a variety of partners engaged in delivering results in the five pillars identified in that national strategy. Pillar one focuses on improving access and affordability of food to tackle this issue. One key proposal supported by the National Strategy is ensuring all Americans are economically secure, including through a child tax credit.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (03:10)', 'Speech': 'Pillar two outlines how we can better integrate nutrition and healthcare. We’re elevating the role of nutrition and food security in overall healthcare, including through disease prevention and management. For example, here, the strategy supports piloting Medicare coverage of meals that are crafted to prevent or to treat diet-related diseases.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (03:44)', 'Speech': 'Pillar three seeks to empower customers to make healthy choices by making those choices more accessible. One proposal supports the expansion of incentives for healthy foods in SNAP and for boosting local food systems, which can create jobs and support local economies, especially in rural America.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (04:01)', 'Speech': 'Pillar four reminds us of the important role that physical activity plays in concert with the food and nutrition security to lead to better health. We’re going to make it easier for people to be more physically active and increase the awareness of the benefits of physical activity. That’s why the National Strategy supports investing in efforts to connect people to parks and other outdoor spaces.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (04:22)', 'Speech': 'Pillar five centers on bolstering funding for nutrition research so we can advance evidence-based policy making, particularly on issues of equity, access, and disparities.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (04:33)', 'Speech': 'Now under the Biden-Harris administration, USDA is proud to have already taken significant steps towards promoting food and nutrition security, in partnership with agencies across the federal family. Last year, USDA modernized the Thrifty Food Plan, which serves as the basis for SNAP benefits. This resulted in the first permanent increase purchasing power of SNAP benefits in 45 years. In doing so, we lifted 2.3 million people out of poverty, including nearly 1 million of our children. Earlier this month, USDA announced $2 billion in additional funding to food banks and school meal programs for purchasing American-grown foods. And just last week, we launched a new $100 million initiative called the Healthy Meals Incentives Initiative to improve the nutritional quality of our school meals. But we’re just getting started, and I want to highlight the proposed pathway to the National Strategy Meals.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (05:48)', 'Speech': 'This is a core intervention to improve child health, hunger, and health. And recent research demonstrates that school meals provide the healthiest food a child eats during the day. The proposal reorients this important program as a key health tool to provide the highest quality meals and to engage children around healthy choices. And we also increase access to local and regional foods, enabling more schools to cook meals from scratch by funding, training, and equipment purchases, investing in robust school nutrition workforce, and expanding nutrition education for our children.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (06:21)', 'Speech': 'These changes are crucial, however, the federal government cannot do them alone. We’re hosting this conference to bring together local governments and private businesses, including food companies, grocery stores, non-profits, researchers, and healthcare providers to unite around a vision put forward in this strategy. To jumpstart this effort today, the White House announced bold commitments from the nation’s businesses, philanthropic and nonprofit sectors. It’s going to take these groups and many others to end hunger and improve nutrition.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (06:51)', 'Speech': 'To compliment the Bold School meals proposal I just described, the national nonprofit FoodCorps will mobilize $250 million to impact 500,000 students per year over the next eight years to increase access to free and nourishing school meals, and to expand hands-on nutrition, education and schools through their Nourishing Futures initiative. Meijer, the Midwest Super chain store will receive USDA approval to offer a new incentive in its SNAP customers to buy nutritious foods. Starting this fall, Meijer will offer its SNAP customers discounts to purchase quality foods, fruits, and vegetables. This is personal to each of us. It touches all of us. As we embark on this conference, I want all of us to take a moment to recognize the significance of what we are about to do. Something like this hasn’t happened in more than 50 years. Let’s keep the momentum of today going in a new and meaningful, strong way so that we can fully meet this important moment for our children, for our community, and for our country. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (08:23)', 'Speech': 'Please welcome to the stage Jimmieka Mills, co-founder, Equitable Spaces.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (08:38)', 'Speech': 'Great morning, all. I’m Jimmieka Mills, a researcher, writer, and mother. Originally from Oakland, California, but currently living in Houston, Texas. As a child, I experienced firsthand the impacts of poverty, hunger, and homelessness on my mind, my body and my soul, and those of my family and others in my community…QQQ'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (09:03)', 'Speech': 'Those of my family, and others in my community. I know what it’s like to not know where your next meal will come from, both as a child and as a parent. So I know, truly know, why programs like WIC, SNAP, P-EBT, and Universal Free School Meals are so critical to my health and wellbeing, and the health and wellbeing of my family, my community, and this country. As a parenting student attending community college, I face barriers accessing student aid, stable housing, childcare, and food. I realized they were often the result of policy solutions that were not informed by those directly impacted by them, like me. That’s what led me to found Equitable Spaces along with my friend and Co-Founder Diane Sullivan. Our mission is to create opportunities for people with lived experience to be heard and included in the design of equitable policy solutions. This conference represents an historic opportunity for us to learn directly from those most impacted, lift up programs that have helped so many people, and to create solutions that ensure that no one, in a country with the most abundant food system in the world, ever goes hungry again.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 4: (10:59)', 'Speech': 'This is why today I’m so excited to join you all in this room. Particularly those of you with lived experience, as we seek to end hunger, reduce diet related diseases, and eliminate health disparities, demonstrating what is possible when we are guided by those with lived experience. Mr. President, it is my highest, highest honor of this life, aside from giving birth to my child, David, I love you, but such an honor to share the stage with you, and to thank you personally for your leadership. It is now my esteemed honor to introduce you all to our President, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (11:53)', 'Speech': 'Hello everybody. Don’t jump. Please, sit down. Sit down. She’s awful good, isn’t she? She’s really good. Shameka, thank you for joining us for this historic conference on Hunger, Nutrition & Health. Before I began, speaking of health, you all have been reading and hearing about Hurricane Ian, and its impact it’s going to have on our fellow Americans down in Florida. Yesterday I spoke with Governor DeSantis for some time. My team has been in constant contact with him from the very beginning, and the mayors of Tampa, St. Pete’s, and Clearwater.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:06)', 'Speech': 'My message has been absolutely clear. We are on the alert and in action. We’ve approved every request Florida has made for temporary assistance, emergency shipments, long-term assistance, that I’ve received. We discussed what we’ve done to prepare for the hurricane. That includes dispatching hundreds of FEMA personnel, and activating thousands of National Guard members. I’ve also developed a search and rescue team and deployed them to multiple federal agencies, and they’re already on the ground and ready to help, as we speak.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (13:41)', 'Speech': 'FEMA prepositioned, literally, millions of liters of water, millions of meals, and hundreds of generators. We’ve a scheduled everything we can possibly do, we think, so do the mayors and governor. We have put up shelters, they’re ready. We’re not sure exactly where it’s going to hit, but it’s pretty getting pretty clear exactly where it’s going to hit. I made it clear to the governor and the mayors that the federal government is ready to help in every single way possible.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (14:10)', 'Speech': 'Now, I want to repeat what I said yesterday to the people of Florida. This storm is incredibly dangerous, to state the obvious. It’s life-threatening. You should obey all warnings and directions from emergency officials. Don’t take anything for granted. Use their judgment, not yours. Evacuate when ordered. Be prepared. The storm warnings are real. The evacuation notices are real. The danger is real. When the storm passes, the federal governments can be there to help you recover. We’ll be there to help you clean up and rebuild, to help Florida get moving again. We’ll be there at every step of the way. That’s my absolute commitment to the people in the state of Florida. If you’ll forgive me, I want to add one more warning. That’s warning to the oil and gas industry executives. Do not, let me repeat, do not use this as an excuse to raise gasoline prices or gouges the America people. The price of oil has stayed relatively low. It kept going down. The price of gas should be going down, as well. My experts informed me the production of only about 190,000 barrels a day has been impacted by the storm thus far. That’s less than 2% of the United States daily production impacted for a very short period of time.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (15:45)', 'Speech': 'This small temporary storm impact on oil production provides no excuse. No excuse for price increases at the pump, none. If gas companies try to use this storm to raise price of the pump, I will ask officials to look into whether price gouging is going on. America’s watching, the industry should do the right thing. As a matter of fact, they should move more quickly now to bring down the price at the pump, because the price of gasoline is down a great deal. There’s too much of a delay between the price of barrel of oil and the price of gasoline at the pump.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (16:24)', 'Speech': 'Now, to why we’re all here for this on this historic day. The sector of Agriculture already said everything, so I’m leaving. You did. So I apologize to you for any repetition that may occur here. But all kidding aside, it’s been over 50 years to state the obvious, you all know it well, since President Nixon convened the original White House conference on Hunger, Nutrition, & Health. That single conference, and the laws that it inspired, led it transformational change that has helped millions of Americans live healthier lives for generations. Since that time, advances in research and medicine have taught us so much more about nutrition and health.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (17:16)', 'Speech': 'Today I’m convening in this conference again, because I believe we can use these advances to do even more to make America a stronger and a healthier nation. So many of you know so much about this as well, and you’re committed. I want to thank all of you here, including bipartisan elected officials, like Representative of Government, Senator Braun, Senator Booker. Representative Jackie, are you here? Where’s Jackie? I didn’t think she was going to be here to help make this a reality. Thanks to Senator Stabenow, Representative DeLauro for their leadership. Here today, we have advocates and activists. José Andrés, you heard of him, haven’t you? Last time we hung out on the Ukrainian border in Poland, and leaders of-'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:03)', 'Speech': '… out on the Ukrainian border in Poland, and leaders of business, labor, agriculture, faith, and philanthropy, and to achieve ambitious goals that I know we can do if we work together. I really do know we can do this, end hunger in this country by the year 2030 and lower the toll that diet related diseases takes on far too many Americans. This goal is within our reach. Just look at how far we’ve come on child poverty. 30 years ago, as reference, one in four children lived below the poverty line. Today, one in twenty live below the poverty line. So I know we can take tackle hunger as well, and I’ve released a national strategy to meet that bold goal, a strategy that has three key principles.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (18:55)', 'Speech': 'First, help more Americans. So this again, help more Americans access the food that will keep their families nourished and healthy. A lot of food deserts out there. Second, give folks the option and information they need to make healthy dietary choices. Thirdly, help more Americans be physically active. People want to be. Lots of times there’s no places to go to be active from where they live. The good news is we’ve already been laying a strong foundation for this work. Soon after I came to office, I signed what was called the American Rescue Plan into law. It helped put food on the table and keep a roof over the heads of millions of American families and helped our economy create nearly 10 million new jobs, most jobs created in that timeframe in American history.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (19:45)', 'Speech': 'A key piece of the American Rescue Plan is the expanded Childcare Tax Credit. Where is she? The gentlewoman from Connecticut. I see. Overwhelmingly, working families use the Child Tax Credit to buy food and other basic needs for their families, and it’s helped cut child poverty by nearly 50% in the United States. 50%. And it cut food insecurity for families by 26%. Look folks, people are constantly looking at federal programs to see which ones are working and which ones are ineffective. Well, during the pandemic, we had a real world example right in front of us. The expanded childcare tax cut is one of the most effective programs we’ve ever seen, and that’s why my national strategy calls on Congress to expand the child credit permanently. Permanently.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (20:49)', 'Speech': 'You got to do it. We tried. We couldn’t get it done the first time. We’ll get it done this time. At the same time, I remain committed to protecting workers’ rights and fair wages and collective bargaining, including workers who grow, produce and process our food, who transport it to grocery stores, who stock the grocery shelves, so they too can afford to feed their families. Look, folks, my strategy would also make permanent an American Rescue Plan program that has made sure families, including over 30 million children, had money to buy groceries in the summer months, so kids don’t go hungry when school is in the session.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (21:39)', 'Speech': 'Sounds silly for a person to hear that, don’t have a child. But the school programs, food programs do a lot. During the summer months, things change. In the next 10 years, my plan, as was already referenced, would make at least nine million more children eligible for free school meals, a major first step for free meals for every single student. And we’re also supporting schools so they can cook more meals from scratch, purchase more food from local farmers and ranchers. This will mean kids will have healthier meals, and we’ll strengthen rural economies at the same time.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (22:22)', 'Speech': 'You heard from Senator… Secretary Vilsack. Senator. Excuse me, I promoted you. All kidding aside, he’s doing a hell of a job, earlier, and I want to thank him for leading in this. He knows a great deal about it and he cares passionately about this issue. The national strategy recognized the critical role that nutrition plays in our health and our healthcare system, and it acknowledges that we have to give families the tools to keep them healthy. How many of you here are medical people involved in research? Almost every single discipline, from cancer to heart disease on down the line, are finding out it is affected by diet and exercise. I mean, things you all knew, but it wasn’t proved before.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (23:16)', 'Speech': 'So example, heart disease is a leading cause of death in America. In 19 states, more than 35% of adults are obese. In 19 states. 19. For seniors and millions of folks on Medicaid, our national strategy to expand access to nutrition and obesity counseling so they can get the guidance they need to stay healthy. Not only do people need to know what they should be eating, our national strategy also calls for doctors, nurses, dentists to be trained to spot the signs of hunger. The Food and Drug Administration is already using its authority around labeling so you know which food is high in trans fats and sodium, so you can figure out which food is actually good for you and what isn’t good for you, and that only is going to increase informing people.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:09)', 'Speech': 'Both in too many underserved communities, urban, rural, and tribal, there’s nowhere to buy fresh food for miles, or safe places for kids to play or adults to exercise. I’ve signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. It creates space to live, work and play safely. It doesn’t just build highways and build new ports and airports and the like. It also has the ability to transform systems that are already overworked right now, where families can drink clean water, breathe clean air, use public transit so they can shop at nearby grocery stores that stock fresh and healthy foods.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (24:44)', 'Speech': 'We also know that too often, healthier foods cost more. That’s why my strategy calls for Congress to expand incentives to purchase fruits and vegetables for low income families, Rely on SNAP benefits to buy groceries so it’ll be easier to afford the food that’s good for you. Until recently, the way SNAP benefits were calculated hadn’t been… I think this was referenced already, hadn’t been updated for nearly 45 years. Actually over 45 years. So last year my administration changed the formula, and now folks are getting an average of 36 extra dollars in their pockets per month.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (25:28)', 'Speech': 'Physical activity is part of living a healthy lifestyle and avoiding dietary related diseases. We’re going to work with Congress to increase access to the country’s parks, county, city, national, especially for Americans in low income communities who need public transit to get there. It will also give more families a chance to hike, to bike, to breathe fresh air. Through the Inflation Reduction Act we’re making historic investments in climate and public health so families can get outside and be physically active in the air that’s clean, not polluted with dirty diesel from buses and trucks, and school buses as well.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:06)', 'Speech': 'The Department of Education and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, are going to help schools expand physical education classes in the summer schools and summer programs, so kids get off to a healthy start in life. In summer school, they’re also going to have physical capacity, they have gym, the equivalent of gym, and after school programs, so we get kids off to a healthy start. We should take advantage of the opportunities when we have these children.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (26:34)', 'Speech': 'There’s so much more in our strategy, and so much more in our imagination, but one thing is clear. Meeting our bold goals requires a whole of government approach, and a whole of society effort. That’s why I’m so excited to see all of you here. You represent society in a way that touches every aspect of society, every part of the country. When I look out at all of you and the work you’re doing in your communities, I just know we can do this.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:03)', 'Speech': '… in your communities. I know. I just know we can do this. People are becoming more aware. I mean people who are getting hurt by the failure to have the access, they’re beginning to be aware, and they’re beginning to think in ways they didn’t think before, what their dietary habits should be, and how they should be feeding their children, if they can feed them.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (27:26)', 'Speech': 'Well before, especially during the pandemic, so many of you were there to help your fellow Americans. They lost their jobs, closed their businesses, faced eviction, homelessness, hunger, lost control; maybe the worst of all, lost hope and dignity. But whether it’s been your life’s work or you’re just getting started, all of you are stepping up. You collected food donations. You served and saved baskets and lunches and breakfast foods. I mean just across the board you did everything; in school programs, and summer school programs. You found new ways to get food from farms to restaurants to dinner tables. You gave other families hope. And my church, we have an expression when someone’s doing something, they say, “You’re doing the Lord’s work.” A lot of people have been doing the Lord’s work. That’s what each of you are doing. And we’re on our way in a way that I don’t think that we have for a while.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (28:25)', 'Speech': 'And again, science changes things; and people are realizing not only whether or not they’re “overweight or obese or not healthy,” but certain diseases are affected by what they eat, what they intake, and people are beginning… The more we can spread that word and educate people on what’s at stake, the more we’re going to see change. But we have to be ready as a government, as a people, to provide the elements of change that are going to change things for them. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the fact that the economy is turning around high-level food insecurity, we saw how the pandemic is down. But despite the progress, 1-in-10 American households still do not have access to enough food. 1-in-10. We’re working to deliver an economy that finally works for working families. Jobs are up. People are back to work. We’re taking on inflation seriously, enacting policies to bring down cost, but there’s always significantly more we can do. That’s why we’re here today, to harness our greatest resource: our fellow Americans. Everyone.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (29:39)', 'Speech': 'Everyone has an important role to play. Local, state, territory, and travel governments, and the federal government as well. The private sector, civil society, agriculture, philanthropy, academia. For example, the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Heart Association are expanding research into the relationship between food health and health equity. And the Food Nutrition and Investor Coalition is investing $2.5 billion into proven technologies and startup companies, pioneering new ways for reducing hunger and improving nutrition. Today we’re announcing over $8 billion in commitments from over 100 different organizations to help reach our goals. $8 billion.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:29)', 'Speech': 'And I also firmly believe the work ahead should be bipartisan. There shouldn’t be anything partisan about any of this. Just as it was when President Nixon first convened this conference, and when Senator George McGovern and Bob Dole transformed America’s role in reducing hunger in America around the world.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (30:51)', 'Speech': 'And this work on hunger and nutrition and physical health is critical to addressing our mental health and wellness as well, which is a key pillar to my unity agenda that I call for in my State of the Union Address. Again, bipartisan. This is something that we should be all rallying the whole country to work on together.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (31:11)', 'Speech': 'And thinking internationally, global inflation and Putin’s war on Ukraine have sparked global food crisis. Just last week at the United Nations, I talked about commitments we were making to tackle food insecurity worldwide. Because in every country in the world, in every state in this country, no matter what else divide us: if a parent cannot feed a child, there’s nothing else that matters to that parent. If you look at your child and you can’t feed your child, what the hell else matters? I really mean it, worldwide.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (31:47)', 'Speech': 'So folks, let me close with this: I believe America, and you’re tired of hearing hear me say it I’m sure as an inflection point. It happens every six or eight generations where so much changes in the world that everything that comes after it is different than it was before.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (32:09)', 'Speech': 'You’ve also heard me talk about the need for us to restore the soul of America. All I’m talking about is just restore a state of decency, treating people with respect, treating people in a way that you’d expect you want to be treated. And by the way, some of you were around long enough to remember we used to be that way in politics. We fought like hell. No, I’m serious, we fought like hell, but ultimately the vast majority were decent. One of my best friends was a guy who was like a brother I always fought with. We’d shout at each other on the floor of the Senate, and then go have lunch together. His name was John McCain. The point is every Senator Convention can acknowledge that. This should be an organizing element of how we start to talk to one another again dealing with food insecurity. The task before this conference is the important work of fellows, and meeting this inflection point, by nourishing the soul of America.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (33:18)', 'Speech': ""In America, no child… no child… should go to bed hungry. No parent should die of disease that can be prevented. This has always been a country, at our best, when we’re at our best, we think big. It’s almost like we don’t think anymore that we can do big things, and I mean it sincerely. Think about it. I realize this is not directly related, but one of the things that I say to my team, my friends, “If I could wave a wand and change one thing that would change America’s attitude about all we’re able to do and remember who we were, I’d wave a wand and say, ‘cure cancer.'” Why cancer? Everybody is scared to death of cancer and most people don’t think we can do much about it. We can. But imagine if we did that. People would say, “My God. We’re back.” Well, this could be a gigantic step, a gigantic step to remind us who the hell we are.""}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (34:31)', 'Speech': 'This is the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing… I really mean it… there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together, so let’s work together.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (34:48)', 'Speech': 'God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

Thank you all for joining us today for the second meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force and Reproductive Healthcare Access. We’re honored to have both the president and vice president here today as we discuss the critical issue of reproductive rights. And we’re also looking forward to hearing from four physicians who will speak about the impact of the Dobbs decision on their medical practice and on their patients. But first, I’d like to turn it over to you, Madame Vice President, to get us started.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (00:28)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Madam Klein. Good afternoon. So the Dobbs decision created a healthcare crisis in America. This task force was convened by the President of the United States to address this crisis in a way that we would approach it from an all of government, hands on approach to address what we have the ability to do to ensure that the women of America receive all the protections they are due under law. And that our administration, through our agencies can provide, to assist them, to have access to the care they need and deserve.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (01:07)', 'Speech': 'We believe, and I certainly believe, that a woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body and that her government should not be making those decisions for her. We believe that if she chooses, she of course will and can consult with her physician, with her loved ones, with her faith leader. One does not have to abandon their faith or beliefs to agree that the government should not be making these decisions for the women of America.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (01:39)', 'Speech': 'Today, extremist so-called leaders are attacking the freedom and liberty of millions of women at a state level. In Arizona, for example, a judge recently upheld an 1864, that’s not a statute, that’s the year, 1864 abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. In Wisconsin, as another example, that state activated an abortion ban that was passed in 1849. That’s 173 years ago. And make note that at that time, women also did not have the right to vote.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (02:17)', 'Speech': 'What we are seeing in laws around our country is the criminalization of doctors and healthcare providers. In some situations up to five to six years in prison would be the penalty. These laws have been written in past, many of them when women were deprived, like I said, of their full rights as citizens and the right to vote, when we are thinking about those laws from 1864 and 1849.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (02:42)', 'Speech': 'We have convened this task force at the earliest days after the Dobbs decision and this is our next convening, our second meeting of the task force. In August when we convened, there was a lot of work to address and determine what we could do as an administration. Since then, I’m proud to report a lot of work has taken place. For example, in our Department of Veterans Affairs, the Veterans Affairs Agency will provide abortion care to veterans and family members to protect the health or life of the woman in cases of rape or incest. An example of the work that is happening includes the Department of Education, which is making clear that it is against the law under Title IX to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy. At the Department of Justice, we know that the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in Idaho to protect emergency medical care, and the Idaho Federal Court issued a preliminary injunction against the ban there.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (03:45)', 'Speech': 'It is important to know that if there were a national law that was passed in the United States Congress to protect reproductive care, so called leaders then could not ban abortion even in the cases of rape and incest. They could not criminalize providers. They could not limit access to contraception, if Congress passed a law that protected these rights. So it is important for everyone to know what is at stake. To stop and reverse these attacks on women, we need to pass such a national law. And so we need the American people to make their voices heard and take a stand on the right of all women to exercise their choice to have access to reproductive healthcare.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (04:41)', 'Speech': 'And I’ll close by mentioning that as we know, Justice Clarence Thomas said the quiet part out loud in terms of the other rights that are also now at stake, such as access to contraception and same sex marriage, marriage equality. And we already see, by the way, our early warnings of that taking place. Take for example, what’s happening at the University of Idaho, which is refusing to provide contraception to their students. It’s already starting. So again, this presents, this issue, a crisis as it relates to healthcare in America. In response, we will continue to do the work as an administration, including working with folks in our country to build a coalition around all folks who understand what is at stake for them and the people they love.'}, {'Time': 'Kamala Harris: (05:43)', 'Speech': 'And with that, I will again thank Jen Klein for her work and Co chair Secretary Becerra, and pass it back to you, Jen, to moderate the discussion.'}, {'Time': 'Jen Klein: (05:52)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Vice President Harris, for your leadership of course, and for your continued commitment to these issues. It’s now my earned honor to turn to you, Mr. President. President Biden.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:03)', 'Speech': 'It’s on. It’s okay. Got it.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:06)', 'Speech': 'Well, first of all, I created this task force in the aftermath of the Supreme Courts, what most people would acknowledge as a fairly extreme decision on Dobbs, to launch a whole of government approach to address the damages of that decision. Excuse me. And I’ve said before, the court got Rowe right nearly 50 years ago and the Congress should codify the protections of Roe and do it once and for all. But right now we’re short a handful of votes, so the only way it’s going to happen is if the American people make it happen.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (06:44)', 'Speech': 'And meanwhile, congressional Republicans are doubling down on the extreme position with the proposal for a national ban. Let me be clear what that means. It means that even if you live in a state where extremist Republican officials aren’t running the show, your right to choose will still be at risk because Republicans in Congress want to pass the law to take away the right to choose for every woman in every state, in every county. And there’s no pushing back from that. It’s also pushing laws to not allow for exceptions of rape and incest or the life of the mother in some cases. It’s really scary part, that in some states they’re already succeeding.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (07:37)', 'Speech': 'When the Dobbs decision came down, I said, and Justice Thomas warned us very plainly, that this wouldn’t stop with a woman’s right to choose and it would extend to the right to privacy itself and things like contraception. So it was no surprise that we’re seeing extremist laws pop up around the country that are having a ripple effect far beyond the health rights of a pregnant woman. We have doctors here with us today who are on the front lines of this crisis and many of these laws would make doctors criminals just for treating a patient. In Arizona, they had a law, which is mentioned by the vice president and on the books in 1864. That 1864, that’s 1864 during the Civil War, it went into effect again a week and a half ago.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (08:29)', 'Speech': 'And just two days after it went in effect, a young 14 year old girl, who has been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis initially couldn’t get a refill for her prescription, the drugs she’d been taking for years to deal with her two diseases. Because, concerns that that very prescription could be used to terminate the pregnancy in violation of a law in that state. And that’s exactly what we’re afraid would happen. This …'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:03)', 'Speech': '… and that’s exactly what we’re afraid would happen. This 14 year old girl couldn’t get the medicine she needed for arthritis because of the extreme, backward, and misguided law. Now, officials at the University of Idaho said it should stop providing contraception, as was mentioned by the Vice President. In fact, they told the university staff that they could get in trouble just for talking or telling students about where they can get birth control. Folks, what century are we in? I mean, what are we doing? I respect everyone’s view on this personal decisions they make, but my Lord, we’re talking about contraception here. It shouldn’t be that controversial. But this is what it looks like when you start to take away the right of privacy.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (09:50)', 'Speech': 'I’ve asked Education Secretary Cardona to look at the steps that we could take to protect college students and school employees in Idaho or other states where the access to contraception is at risk. And my message to any other college considering enacting policies like this; don’t. Please don’t. We’re not going to sit by and let Republicans throughout the country enact extreme policies to threaten access to basic healthcare. And that’s why we are all here today. That’s why we formed this commission. I signed two executive orders, and my administration has taken a number of actions that this task force is charged to carry out; to protect access to reproductive healthcare, including emergency medical care; to protect a woman’s right to travel to get the healthcare she needs; to receive healthcare free of discrimination, and protect her privacy when she seeks it. And we’re fighting this battle in the courts as well.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (10:54)', 'Speech': 'And I want to thank the Vice President and Secretary Becerra for their leadership on this task force. And I also want to thank Secretary McDonough for leading an important effort at the VA. My message to folks across the country who are worried about what we’re seeing is first, that we have your back. We’re not going to step back from this. And second, we’ve heard your voices. Now I want to turn it over to Secretary Cardona now for his comments.'}, {'Time': 'Miguel Cardona: (11:24)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I share your grave concerns about maintaining access to contraception and reproductive health services on our college campuses, and ensuring there’s accurate, reliable information for students and for educators. Students need access to healthcare to thrive in school and in life, and that includes reproductive healthcare. Thank you also to Vice President Harris. In August, we met with college leaders grappling with new sweeping restrictions to their states. Our work together is ongoing. It’s clear; the Dobbs ruling has sown fear and confusion on our college campuses. I worry about the chilling effects this uncertainty, including about access to birth control, will have on students. I think about the one in four women who experience sexual assault in college, and what this means for their safety and their wellbeing. I think about the college student I met in September who wasn’t able to enroll until she escaped a violent abuser. Access to reproductive healthcare is vital to these students and to countless others for success in college and beyond.'}, {'Time': 'Miguel Cardona: (12:44)', 'Speech': 'Today, my department is issuing a new resource to remind schools of their obligation under Title IX. For 50 years, Title IX has protected students from sex-based discrimination, and since 1975, it has also protected students from discrimination based on pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or any related conditions. My department is fully committed to enforcing Title IX’s protections. The resource also explains how to file a complaint with your school or our Office for Civil Rights if you or someone you know encounters discrimination. Today I want to be clear with college leaders in America; access to contraception should not be in question. And access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, is critical to the wellbeing and success of our nation’s students. If you’re committed to student success, you must be committed to student health. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Jen Klein: (13:50)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much, Secretary Cardona, again, for your partnership, for your leadership. Now we’re going to turn to the real experts in the room, the physicians who have come to talk about the impact that Dobbs is having and the laws passing across the country are having on their practice and their patients. So we’re going to start with you, Dr. Nisha Verma.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Nisha Verma: (14:11)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Good afternoon, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and distinguished members of the task force. It is an honor to join you today. My name is Dr. Nisha Verma, and I am a board certified, fellowship trained obstetrician gynecologist, who provides full spectrum reproductive healthcare. I’m a fellow of the American College of OB-GYNs and currently provide care in Georgia.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Nisha Verma: (14:36)', 'Speech': 'Growing up in the South, I saw firsthand the devastating impacts of restrictions on contraception and abortion care in the lives of real people; my friends, family, and people in my community. They are the reason I’m here before you today. I became a doctor and ob-gyn because of my drive to care for people without judgment throughout the course of their lives, regardless of their healthcare needs. Now, the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion care has wreaked havoc across this country, as states, including Georgia, have severe abortion bans in effect, and have threatened clinicians with criminal penalties.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Nisha Verma: (15:17)', 'Speech': 'Because of a law that is not based in medicine or science, I am forced to turn away patients that I know how to care for. I have had teenagers with chronic medical conditions that make their pregnancy very high risk, and women with highly desired pregnancies who receive a terrible diagnosis of a fetal anomaly cry when they learn that they can’t receive their abortion in our state and beg me to help them. Imagine looking someone in the eye and saying, “I have all the skills and the tools to help you, but our state’s politicians have told me I can’t.” Imagine having to tell someone, “You are sick, but not sick enough to receive care in our state based on our laws’ very narrow exceptions.”'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Nisha Verma: (15:59)', 'Speech': 'We train for years and years to be able to provide evidence-based, individualized care to our patients. Now, as a doctor in Georgia, I am being forced to grapple with impossible situations where the laws of my state directly violate the medical expertise I gained through years of training and the oath I took to provide the best care to my patients. My colleagues and I have to think about whether we’re going to be criminalized and imprisoned, whether our licenses will be taken away, whether our livelihood will be threatened for providing compassionate, evidence-based care. Unfortunately, we’ve already seen these threats become a reality for our fellow ob-gyn in Indiana over the summer. That absolutely has a chilling effect.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Nisha Verma: (16:46)', 'Speech': 'I understand that abortion care can be a complicated issue for many people, just like so many aspects of healthcare and life can be. But I also know that abortion is necessary, compassionate, essential healthcare, and that my patients are capable of making complex, thoughtful decisions about their health and lives. I remain unwavering in my commitment to support people in my home and community in the South in whatever way I can. I appreciate continued efforts to secure access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare for my patients. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today.'}, {'Time': 'Jen Klein: (17:29)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Dr. Verma. Now we’re going to turn to you, Dr. Kristin Lyerly.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (17:36)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much, and it is truly a pleasure and a privilege to be here with you all today. My name is Dr. Kristin Lyerly. I am a general obstetrician-gynecologist in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and I’m a fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In my practice, I provide comprehensive care for women and underrepresented populations. Prior to Dobbs, I was also an abortion provider in Sheboygan, at one of only four-'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (18:03)', 'Speech': '… provider in Sheboygan at one of only four abortion clinics all located in the southeastern part of the state. With the fall of Rowe, our circumstances changed dramatically. We stopped providing abortions in Wisconsin altogether. As we’ve already discussed, we have a law in Wisconsin from 1849, which is one year older than the state, and 70 years before women earned the right to vote in this country. This law makes it a felony for me to provide abortion care to my patients. There are no exceptions for rape and no exceptions for incest. The only exception is for the life of the mother.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (18:42)', 'Speech': 'But pregnant people don’t have a warning light that comes on when they’ve crossed that threshold. We have to use our clinical judgment developed through over a decade of formal education, experience and commitment to make those kinds of sensitive, individualized decisions. So when places like Sheboygan County, where the District Attorney has specifically said that he will prosecute physicians, can I count on him to trust my clinical judgment? Looking back, would we agree that I met the criteria that my patient was sick enough? The effects are chilling.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (19:18)', 'Speech': 'People in our state are being denied medication for miscarriage management. They are being denied treatment for, in emergency departments, while actively bleeding, presumably because the treatment for a miscarriage, the medical term is a spontaneous abortion, is essentially the same as the medication or procedure that can terminate an early pregnancy. Those who can afford it, the money time away from work, assistance with childcare obligations, they now have to go to Illinois or Minnesota. Many, especially in abusive relationships or difficult social situations, they have to continue their pregnancies or they resort to desperate measures.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (20:06)', 'Speech': 'Downstream this affects all of us. With physician burnout at an all time high and a number of physicians leaving the field in the wake of the pandemic, our training programs can’t keep up. Medical students and residents who had planned to stay and practice in Wisconsin are now wondering whether they will receive the training that they need to take care of their patients and whether they can live and work in a state where doctors can be jailed for fulfilling their duty of care.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (20:39)', 'Speech': 'Last week I spoke with two physicians who have served in a rural community that they love for many years. They’ve worked incredibly hard to keep their small obstetrical units open. But now with the threat of criminal charges hanging over their heads, they told me that they have their resignation letters ready. Their backup plans are prepared. They need a safe place to practice and raise their families if Wisconsin’s criminal abortion ban is determined to be enforceable. And this is the tip of the iceberg.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Kristin Lyerly: (21:10)', 'Speech': 'The economic consequences are well documented. We are already suffering from reduced labor force participation, diminished earning potential, and fewer educational opportunities, and this too affects all of us. Our maternal mortality rates are the worst in the developed world. And in Wisconsin, a Black mom is five times more likely to die as a result of pregnancy than a White mom. The number of pregnancy related deaths are expected to rise dramatically with implementation of abortion bans as women continue to lose access to essential life saving healthcare. America has a maternal mortality crisis. We have a rural healthcare crisis, and now we have a reproductive healthcare crisis. How many more crises can my patients, can our healthcare system endure? Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (22:11)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (22:14)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much. We’re going to now turn to you, Dr. Parrot.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (22:20)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much. Good afternoon to all of you, to Mr. President, Madame Vice President and members of the task force. Thank you for the privilege of being here and for the opportunity to speak with you all today. My name as you heard is Dr. Jamila Parrot. I use she, her pronouns. I’m a board certified, fellowship trained obstetrician and gynecologist with a comprehensive background in family planning, reproductive health rights and justice. I’m a native Washingtonian and an abortion provider here in the district, caring for the community that raised me, a community that I serve every day working to expand access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare. A community that has been deeply impacted by these bans on abortion care.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (23:09)', 'Speech': 'The aftermath of the Supreme Court decision, a ruling that eviscerated the constitutional right to abortion for millions has been truly devastating for our communities. The relentless attacks on our dignity, our wellbeing, our ability to determine if, when, or how to start and raise our families have not let up. And they have a singular goal in mind, these restrictions are designed to punish people providing abortion care and the family, friends and loved ones who support them. We’ve already seen these attempts, as you’ve heard, to criminalize abortion providers play out in real time. Our colleagues, like Dr. Caitlin Bernard in Indiana, has been targeted by the Attorney General for providing care to a person in need. My friend and colleague and Texas based abortion provider, Dr. Gazzola Moretti, has been threatened multiple times by the Texas officials and has been forced to stop providing care due to threats of criminal punishment and harassment.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (24:18)', 'Speech': 'Abortion is healthcare. It is our human right. It is safe. And despite the claims that these bans are improving the safety and wellbeing of the care we provide, it is actually these bans themselves that are harming our communities. The ripples effects that we see play out on the ground are devastating. And abortion bans are impacting, as you heard, all aspects of reproductive healthcare, including miscarriage and pregnancy care for ectopic pregnancy.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (24:50)', 'Speech': 'While abortion bans should never impact the ability for folks to get emergency care, the confusion and uncertainty created by these restrictions creates chaos at healthcare institutions. And providers are worried, we’re worried about being held criminally responsible for the emergency care that we provide to folks in need. And moreover, evidence shows that abortion bans, as you heard, will already exacerbate abysmal maternal mortality rates. And recent data found that banning abortion will increase maternal mortality by 24% for all women and almost by 40% for Black women. And this is particularly worrisome, given the worsening maternal mortality gap that disproportionately impacts Black, Brown and Indigenous women.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (25:39)', 'Speech': 'As the landscape of abortion access continues to shift, I urge us to remember that these attacks are not new. They did not begin, and they will not end with the Dobb’s ruling. What we’re seeing now is the same intent dressed up in brand new clothes. The goal all along has never wavered to ban all abortion care and to coerce and to control options that people have in making decisions about our families and about our futures. What is new now, however, is that anti-abortion policy makers have been granted a green light to outwardly as opposed to subtly ban abortion access, to jail and punish providers and other healthcare professionals, including doctors, to force people to remain pregnant against their will and sometimes at the risk of their very life. We have no reason to believe these attacks will end with overturning Rowe. We need bold, immediate, brave action to protect our communities and to push for legislation that reinstates basic human rights for every person no matter where they live. There are no safe states. There are no sanctuary cities even here in the district, especially here in the district.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Parrott: (27:03)', 'Speech': 'Especially here in the district because we lack home rule, we have no right to make decisions about our own futures. I appreciate the opportunity for being here today for sharing my story with you for listening to medicine. Thank you all for listening to the science, listening to people who have abortions and those of us who provide abortion care. I look forward to partnering with you all as the work continues ahead.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (27:31)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Jen Klein: (27:31)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Dr. Parrot. And last I’d like to turn to Dr. Saudia Heider.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Heider: (27:37)', 'Speech': 'Good afternoon, President Biden, Vice President Harris and the members of the task force. It’s an honor and privilege to be here to speak to you about my experience as a family planning provider in Illinois. My name is Dr. Saudia Heider. I’m also a board certified OBGYN family planning trained subspecialist and a fellow of the American College of OBGYN. I provide comprehensive obstetrical and gynecologic care to all of my patients including abortion and contraception. I also oversee the Complex Family Planning Fellowship program at my institution, and this is helping to train the next generation of clinicians that are needed to take care of our patients. I am incredibly fortunate to live and work in a state that is supportive of access to full spectrum reproductive healthcare including abortion and contraception. This care is rightfully viewed as essential healthcare in my state. With the rise of legislative restrictions in neighboring states in recent years, and again, this is not new, this has been happening for years, Illinois, like many other surge states, has seen a steady increase in volume of patients traveling to our state from all over the country for abortion care.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Heider: (28:47)', 'Speech': 'While Dobbs’ data is not yet available, we expect the number of patients traveling to Illinois will dramatically rise in the coming months to years, with estimates that patient volume will increase up to 100% with some productions, that 20 to 30,000 patients may travel each year to the Chicago area to seek abortion care. We know that those who are already impacted by the lack of healthcare in general and lack of access to abortion care and reproductive healthcare are lower income and patients of color. These are the patients that will continue to disproportionately be impacted by the Dobbs decision, worsening the maternal health crisis that already exists in our country, as well as the health inequities that persist. In anticipation of this increase, we have taken a number of steps to make sure Illinois is as prepared as possible to provide care to those in need through clinical capacity building, decreasing financial barriers for patients, increasing care coordination for in-state and out-of-state patients.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Heider: (29:50)', 'Speech': 'However, even with this level of preparation and support from our colleagues, institutions, and government officials, we are still facing challenges. As predicted, demand for care has already increased. Appointments are made further out and patients from in-state and out-of-state are experiencing delays in care due to longer wait times, delaying procedures to later in their pregnancy. Many of my patients coming from out-of-state sought and were denied care at multiple locations in their state or in other states before they sought care in Illinois. For example, I recently saw a patient from a southern state with a very serious obstetric condition and abnormal placenta. This condition can cause severe hemorrhage and morbidity if not treated appropriately. This patient sought care in their state and other states weeks before finally traveling to Illinois delaying the care overall. We were able to provide the care required for this patient, which was unfortunately more complex than it needed to be because there were several weeks that ensued before the patient sought care and eventually saw us.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Heider: (30:53)', 'Speech': 'Another patient came to us with a fetal anomaly diagnosed in a neighboring state. In order to receive the needed care, the patient had to leave their family during an incredibly challenging time, travel to us for a two day procedure in Illinois, which was not only emotionally taxing but also financially challenging for the patient and their family. Many more patients with similar stories have come to Illinois and will continue to do so because of the Dobbs decision, but many patients will not be able to get all the financial resources and figure out the logistics to get to us, and those patients will continue to have an unmet need for care.'}, {'Time': 'Dr. Heider: (31:31)', 'Speech': 'I am honored to care for all patients who need access to reproductive healthcare and my team and I will continue to do so in Illinois. However, it is undeniable that the patchwork of access to abortion care exacerbated by the Dobbs decision is negatively affecting patients across the country. We will continue to rise to the challenge and urge policy makers to do the same as a repeal of Rowe has worsened the maternal health crisis and health inequities that have existed for a long time in our country, and we must change this. Thank you so much for listening to our stories and for working with us to move this issue forward.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 3: (32:07)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Jen Klein: (32:09)', 'Speech': 'Thank you so much to all of you. I mean, first of all, for coming here and sharing your incredibly important perspectives, but really more importantly for the work that you’re doing every day in this incredibly challenging and worse environment that you just described. We’re now going to move to the closed press portion of our task force meeting, so thank you very much. [inaudible 00:32:33]'}]"

It’s already legal in many states. And criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment, to housing, and educational opportunities. And that’s before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences. While white and black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, black and brown people are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at disproportionately higher rates. So today I’m taking three steps to end this failed approach.'}, {'Time': 'President Biden: (00:34)', 'Speech': 'First, I’m announcing a pardon for all prior federal offenses for the civil possession of marijuana. There are thousands of people who are convicted for marijuana possession who may be denied employment, housing, or educational opportunities as a result of that conviction. My pardon will remove this burden on them. Second, I’m calling on all governors to do the same for state marijuana possession offenses. Third, the federal government currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule I substance, the same as heroin and LSD and more serious than fentanyl. It makes no sense. So I’m asking the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to initiate a process to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. Even as federal and local regulations of marijuana change, important limitations on trafficking, marketing, and underage sales should stay in place. Too many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It’s time that we right these wrongs.'}]"

During World War II, this is where… It was basically the situation room for FDR. He would look at sensitive information, and now we’re at a period where there’s another high stakes war in Europe. You recently said that this is the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis that there’s a legitimate possibility of someone using a nuclear weapon, which could lead to Armageddon.

No one can be sure what would happen, and it could end in Armageddon.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (05:27)', 'Speech': 'And you still are afraid of that though, that it could?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (05:31)', 'Speech': 'Well, no, I don’t think any rational person is saying the initial use of a nuclear weapon killing thousands of people does not have the prospect of leading to something that can be way out of control.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (05:44)', 'Speech': 'Let’s turn to Saudi Arabia. Some of your Democratic allies on Capitol Hill are afraid that the US got played when you went to Saudi Arabia and fist bumped with the Crown Prince, because now obviously a few months later, Saudi backed OPAC, is slashing oil production in partnership with Russia. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez just called for a freeze on cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including most armed sales. Senator Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate says the Saudis sided with Russia against the United States. Do you think it’s time for the US to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (06:20)', 'Speech': 'Yes. And by the way, let’s get straight where I went. I didn’t go to… went about oil. I went about making sure that we made sure that we weren’t going to walk away from the Middle East and what was going on. And by the way, today, I just got off the telephone with the President of… I got off the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of Lebanon. They’ve worked out a deal. They’ve been at war, declared war with one another for a long time. They’ve worked out a boundary relationship in the Eastern Mediterranean, for oil. Then they’re going to make an agreement that is historic.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (06:56)', 'Speech': 'We also got over… Flights for Israeli planes over Saudi Arabia, we got movement in terms of how we would deal in the Middle East with aggression from Iran. But it wasn’t… There were eight other parties there. It wasn’t about oil.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (07:14)', 'Speech': 'Okay. But you would-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (07:16)', 'Speech': 'But we should, we should. And I am in the process, when this House and Senate gets back, there’s going to be some consequences for what they’ve done with Russia.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (07:29)', 'Speech': 'What kind of consequences? Menendez says, “Suspend all arm sales.” Is that something you’d consider?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (07:34)', 'Speech': 'I’m not going to get into what I’d consider and what I have in mind, but there will be consequences.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (07:40)', 'Speech': 'The midterm elections are four weeks from today. The economy remains top of mind for voters. JP Morgan Chase CEO said the US is likely to enter a recession in the next nine months. Bank of America says the US could start losing a hundred to 75,000 jobs a month. Gas prices are on the rise again. Should the American people prepare for a recession?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (08:01)', 'Speech': 'No. Look, they’ve been saying this now how… Every six months they say this. Every six months they look down the next six months and see what’s going to happen. It hadn’t happened yet. There’s no guarantee that they’re going to be… I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, that’ll be a very slight recession, that is we’ll move down slightly.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (08:23)', 'Speech': 'Look, think about what’s happened. We have done more, we’re in a better position than any other major country in the world, economically and politically. We still have real problems. But look what we’ve got done. We passed so much legislation, that significantly makes a point about, for example, the American Rescue Plan, the legislation to deal with inflation, the Inflation Act. We moved along… I mean, there’s so much that’s been accomplished, that the idea that there’s something, there’s an automaticity to recession is just not there. They’ve been predicting this off and on for the last-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (09:06)', 'Speech': 'But you just said that a slight recession is possible.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (09:09)', 'Speech': 'It is possible. Look, it’s possible. I don’t anticipate it. What I do think, look, we talk about the impact on families. The families are… They have reason to be concerned about energy prices. They have reason to be concerned about a whole range of issues. But look at what we’ve done. The Inflation Reduction Act, look, I know I’m always quoting my dad, but my dad used to say, “Is there any breathing room for a middle class family?” And the breathing room is after all the bills are paid at the end of the month, do they have anything left? And there’s more than one way to bring down the monthly cost for people who in fact are struggling, to make sure they have the ends meet and they have enough money.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (09:53)', 'Speech': 'And that’s what we’ve done with the Inflation Reduction Act. Look, we’ve reduced drug prices. For the first time, we’ve been trying for years to get Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices. We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world, any major nation. We are going to be in a situation where no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for the drugs, no matter how much they cost. They’re going to make sure that nobody has to pay more than $35 a month for insulin, et cetera. So, there’s so much that we’ve done.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (10:25)', 'Speech': 'And the same with on energy. We passed the… Look, what I ran on, I said we’re going to deal with energy. And the energy problem, we’re going to deal with the whole notion of global warming. We pass $368 billion worth of help, which as the same, bankers talk about, is going to bring $700 billion off the sidelines, in investment. Look what’s happened… Look at the investment that’s going on in America right now.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (10:52)', 'Speech': 'Yeah. So, you think Democrats have something to run on?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (10:54)', 'Speech': 'Oh, I think we do. I know we do. And here’s the contrast; What’s the Republican platform going to run on? What are they running on? What are they for? Well, they want to put Social Security on the chopping block every five years. And the other leader comes along and says, “No, every year it should be up for grabs.” Medicare, Medicaid, these aren’t negotiable items in terms of whether you’re going to continue them or not. The first thing they said they’re going to do is get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act. And so what’s that do? They’re going to raise drug prices, raise medical costs again, be sure that we’re going to no longer be able to have the ability to have tax credits for weatherizing your home, saving money. I don’t know what they’re for.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (11:38)', 'Speech': 'Our reporting, CNN’s reporting, and the Washington Post reporting suggests that prosecutors think they could… They have enough to charge your son, Hunter, for tax crimes and a false statement about a gun purchase. Personally and politically, how do you react to that?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (11:54)', 'Speech': 'Well, first of all, I’m proud of my son. This is a kid who got… Not a kid, he’s a grown man. He got hooked on, like many families have had happen, hooked on drugs. He’s overcome that. He’s established a new life. I’m confident that he is… What he says and does are consistent with what happens. For example, he wrote a book about his problems, and was straightforward about it. I’m proud of him. He came along and said, “By the way, this thing about a gun. I didn’t know anything about it.” But turns out that when he made an application to purchase a gun, what happened was he stay… I guess you get asked… I don’t guess. You get asked the question, “Are you on drugs? You use drugs?” He said, “No.” And he wrote about saying no in his book. I have great confidence in my son. I love him. And he’s on the straight and narrow, and he has been for a couple years now, and I’m just so proud of him.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (12:56)', 'Speech': 'You’re about to turn 80 next month. Happy birthday, ahead of time. Whenever anyone raises concerns about your age, you’re the oldest president in the history of the United States, you always say, “Watch me.” Voters have been watching you. Democratic voters approve of the job you’re doing. Democratic voters overwhelmingly like you. But one poll shows that almost two thirds of Democratic voters want a new nominee in 2024. And the top reason they gave was your age. So what’s your message to Democrats who like you, who like what you’ve done, but are concerned about your age and the demands of the job?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (13:30)', 'Speech': 'Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done. Name me a president in recent history who has gotten as much done as I have in the first two years. Not a joke. You may not like what I got done, but the vast majority of American people do like what I got done. It’s a matter of can you do the job? And I believe I can do the job. I’ve been able to do the job. I’ve gotten more done. I got the Inflation Reduction… I got all these pieces of legislation passed, and I ran on that. I said, “This is what I was going to do,” and I’m still getting it done.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:02)', 'Speech': 'Dealing with making sure that veterans get compensated for the-'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (14:07)', 'Speech': 'Burn pits.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:08)', 'Speech': '… the burn pits, making sure that we’re in a situation where we finally have action on guns. And by the way, I’m going to get the assault weapons ban. Before this is over, I’m going to get that again. Not a joke, and watch. And so I just think it’s a matter of has anybody done more in the first two years of their administration for a guy who was… They’ve been saying this about my age since I began to run. So, you can come work out with me in the morning.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (14:38)', 'Speech': 'Anytime, anytime. The big question, of course, is when you’re going to make an official announcement about whether or not you’re going to run for 2024, for reelection. Do you think you’ll make a decision before the end of the year?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (14:50)', 'Speech': 'Well, look, I’m not going to make this about my decision. I’m going to make this about this off year election. After that’s done in November, then I’m going to be in the process of deciding.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (14:59)', 'Speech': 'Is one of the calculations that you think you’re the only one who can beat Donald Trump?'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 2: (15:05)', 'Speech': 'I believe I can beat Donald Trump again.'}, {'Time': 'Speaker 1: (15:08)', 'Speech': 'All right, Mr. President, thank you so much for your time today.

This relief will help my friends who are currently paying their own student bills, so after they walk across the stage, they won’t have to continue paying out of pocket, and can instead think about starting a business, or going straight to grad school, or even saving for a house. This relief is breaking barriers in our communities and in our minds about what we can do with our future. I’m grateful, and I know y’all are as well, that President Biden kept his promise to provide student debt relief to working and middle class families, and I’m proud to introduce him. Please join me in welcoming to Delaware State University President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:51)', 'Speech': 'By the way, as Tom Carper can tell you, I got my political start at Del State. This is the place we organized for Kent and Sussex County. This is how we got going. That was back in 1871, I think, a long time ago. Before I begin, there are a lot of people that might be wondering why I’m here at Del State. It’s because you’re an HBCU, and you play an important role in creating opportunity and possibilities all across the country. We’re here at Del State because it holds such a special place in my heart. There is no better example of a university that has changed so many lives, as Zach just explained about his. Like I’ve said many times, Delaware State brung me to the dance, as they say up in Claymont, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:38)', 'Speech': 'I understand you’ve got a big game tomorrow, Howard University. I’ll tell you what man, in case you haven’t noticed, my VP is a Howard graduate, and she is a very vociferous Howard graduate. As your president can tell you, I’m always bragging about Del State, and we’ve got a little thing going. Besides that, we have a lot more folks, the Divine Nine runs my operation. Y’all think I’m kidding? You think I’m kidding? I’m not kidding. I’ll tell you what, to guarantee your win, I tried to figure out how we could do this, how to get Mike Purzycki to play for you. Mike Purzycki scored more reception than any receiver in University of Delaware history. A hell of a good mayor, but he was even a better ball player. Folks look, what you’ve got to do, I want you to win, but take it a little easy, because I’ve got to go back to Washington. My vice president is an extraordinary partner. I didn’t go to Del State, but my heart’s with you, man. Don’t let me down. Win one for Coach Bo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:06)', 'Speech': 'It’s great to be here with friends. Delaware has great leadership, one of the most effective congressional delegations in America, and that’s not hyperbole. One of the things I love about this team is we have each other’s back. Governor John Carney used to actually work for me, and look, he’s now the governor. He’s more important than anybody, including me, because he has a wife who is an incredible writer. Tommy Carper, one of my best friends from all politics, we’ve been doing this a long time, Tommy. Chris Coons, who has a seat I used to hold, the only difference is that he not only has a law degree, he has a divinity degree. The boy can preach, but he can’t preach as well as the next woman, Lisa Blunt Rochester. Do you think I’m kidding? I’m not. You ever hear her? Whoa.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:08)', 'Speech': 'They have my back, and I have theirs. We have a great attorney General in Kathy Jennings, who worked with my son, Bo, and Lieutenant Governor Bethany Hall is here as well, and the mayor, Robin Christiansen. Thanks for welcoming us a Dover, Mr. Mayor. As I said, Purzycki knows a lot about being mayor, but he’s even a better receiver. Mr. Mayor, thank you for what you’re doing for the city of Wilmington. You’re making a big difference, pal. You really are making a big difference. We’ve got another mayor here today, but she’s no longer the mayor. She happens to be the director of the Office of Public Engagement, Keisha Lance Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta. Madam Mayor, where are you? There she is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:01)', 'Speech': 'Two things I learned you’ve got to know about Keisha. One, she’s smarter than you, and two, she’s smarter than me politically as well, that’s why I hired her. It’s great to have you, and welcome to Del State I’ve been bragging about. The fact of the matter is, she’s also the mayor of Atlanta, but she’s a FAMU grad. Tony, you know where the real power is, as I said, in the Divine nine. Speaking of the president of this great university, this guy used to work for me. Tony worked for me when I was a senator, but he left because he wanted to become a doctor, a PhD in public policy. That wasn’t good enough. Then, he decided he wanted to be president. I got scared as hell he was going to run. But, it turned out he wanted to be the president of the university.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:53)', 'Speech': 'By the way Tony, I told you a true story. When I left the vice presidency, after Bo died, I wasn’t going to get involved in politics anymore. I became a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Before that occurred, three universities came to me and said they wanted to interview me, to consider my being the president of the university. My wife, who’s a professor at a community college, has two masters and a PhD, but she’s smarter than me. She looked at me, and she said, “If you do that, I’m leaving you. It’s one of the toughest jobs in America, especially if you start arguing about parking spaces and office windows.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:37)', 'Speech': 'Tony, thanks buddy, you are a good friend, and I can’t say enough good things about you. A year ago I signed an executive order establishing a presidential initiative to strengthen HBCUs all across America, and I appointed Tony to lead that initiative, because he’s the best. Tony, Keisha, Kamala, and I understand the critical role HBCUs provide for all folks in this country, particularly in building, basically, a ticket to the middle class. HBCUs are great value for all Americans. That’s why, during the pandemic, my administration did something that’s never been done before. We invested $5.8 billion in HBCUs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:23)', 'Speech': 'Some suggested we couldn’t get it done, but we got it done. That money already is out the door, being used very well. Tony and his team use a lot of that money, combined with the money the university raised, to help students at Del State with their debt, reducing the debt burden for 225 graduating seniors. That’s 225 Delaware State University graduates who can start getting on with their lives without the burden of student debt holding them back. That’s what I want to talk about today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:51)', 'Speech': 'Eight weeks ago, I announced that my administration is going to provide $10,000 in debt relief to everyone who has that much debt, or up to that much debt, and $20,000 if you received a Pell Grant, and your income was under $125,000. It’s a plan for people who took out federal student loans before July of this year. A few days ago, I launched an online application process where you can apply for that debt relief. Folks, one of the things I wanted to make sure is we didn’t end up where we were in a position that Barack and I were in terms of the Affordable Care Act. It was made a little bit more difficult, but we made sure we tested it. We tested it for a weekend, to see how it worked John. Guess what? It worked. Almost nine million people signed on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:42)', 'Speech': 'Folks, if you have student debt… you’ve got a time limit. If you have student debt, you can go to studentaid.gov, it’s very easy. Fill out your name, your social security number, your date of birth, and contact information. No forms to upload, no special login to remember, available in English and Spanish, desktop and mobile. Folks, takes less than five minutes. If you need additional information, we’ll follow up with you. This is a game changer. We’re hearing from people all over the country, over 10,000 students have written me letters so far, literally 10,000 so far. It’s about as easy to apply as signing up while hanging out with your friends, or at home and watching a movie. The vast majority are applying on their phones, and it’s easy. In less than a week, close to 22 million people have already given us the information to consider this life-changing relief.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:46)', 'Speech': 'My commitment, when I ran for president the United States, if I was elected, I’d make the government work and deliver for the people. A simple application process keeps that commitment, just as I’m keeping my commitment to relieve student debt as borrowers recover from the economic crisis caused by the once in a lifetime pandemic. The way I think about it, and the way my dad used to talk about this, the way so many at home talk about it, around the kitchen table, how much are the monthly bills? How do you have to pay for those necessities? How much do you have? Is there enough just for little breathing room, as my dad would say, leftover after the end of the month? Our student loan plan lowers costs for Americans as they recover from the pandemic, to give everybody a little more breathing room.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:37)', 'Speech': 'I want to be clear who’s going to benefit most. Working people, middle class folks that earn under $125,000, you get up to $10,000 knocked off the debt. If you earn under $125,000 and you received a Pell Grant, you get a $20,000 knocked off. In total, more than 40 million Americans stand to benefit from this relief. For borrowers out of school, nearly 90% of the relief is going to go to people making under $75,000 a year. Let me be clear, not a dime will go to the top 5% of incomes, period. It goes to people who really need it. Across America, nearly every Pell Graham recipient comes from a family making under $60,000. Two thirds come from families making under $30,000 a year. Here at Del State, over 75% of the students are Pell Grant recipients. That matters for millions of working and middle class people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:44)', 'Speech': 'Let’s talk about who is against helping the millions of you who need the help, who want to make sure you have a shot. Republican members of Congress and Republican governors are doing everything they can to deny this relief, even to their own constituents. As soon as I announced my administration’s plan on student debt, they started attacking it, saying all kinds of things. Their outrage is wrong, and it’s hypocritical, but we’re not letting them get away with it. They’ve been fighting us in the courts, but just yesterday, a state court and the Supreme Court said, “No, we’re on Biden’s side.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:30)', 'Speech': 'I will never apologize for helping working and middle class Americans as they recover from the pandemic, especially not to the same Republicans officials who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited wealthy Americans and the biggest corporations, that wasn’t paid for, and racked up our deficit. I don’t want to hear it from MAGA Republicans, officials who had hundreds of thousands of dollars of debts, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief loans forgiven, who now are attacking me for helping working class and middle class Americans.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:06)', 'Speech': 'My team at the White House posted a video of this online, you should check it out. Marjorie Taylor Greene, she and her husband got $180,000 in business loans forgiven from the PPP program. She said, “It’s completely unfair for us to forgive student loans for working and middle class Americans.” Representative Vern Buchanan of Florida said our plan was reckless. Guess how much he got in that program forgiven? $2,300,000. This is not a joke, you can’t make this stuff up. Republican governors wrote me a letter, saying this relief only helps the elite few. Do you all know you’re the elite few? I knew you were really special, but I didn’t know you’re the elite few. I’m serious. Ted Cruz, the great senator from Texas, he said it’s for “Slackers who don’t deserve relief.” Who in the hell do they think they are? I mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:18)', 'Speech': 'Despite what Republican visuals say, we can afford student relief. That’s because, in the first two years of my administration, the historic deficit reduction, the very deficit reduction the Republicans voted against. This morning, my administration announced that this year, the federal deficit fell by $1 trillion, $400 billion just this year, the largest one year drop in all of American history. $1 trillion, $400 billion. It follows last year’s historic drop in the deficit of $350 billion. We’re going to reduce the deficit by another $250 billion over the next decade, and the reason for that is because Medicare is going to be able to negotiate drug prices, and lower the cost. We pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world for the same drug. You can buy the same exact drug in a drug store here in Dover or Wilmington, and if you go over to Paris, France, or anywhere in Europe, it can be as much as 40% to 60% less, the same exact drug.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:31)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I don’t want to hear any weeping or gnashing of teeth from pharma, the big companies. In just 20 months since I’ve been in office, we’ve cut the deficit in half, and that’s not all. In relieving student debt, were also resuming student loan repayments that you’re going to have to start to pay. We had this long period where no one had to pay, because of the pandemic. Come January, folks whose debt isn’t fully canceled are going to have to start paying the student loans off. That means billions of dollars a year are going to start coming back into the treasury as well. My administration’s plan is economically responsible, and an economically responsible course to ensure a smooth transition to repayment, and prevent unnecessary defaults. It’s also focused on going after fraudsters who call borrowers to pretend they’re the government, and want to help you with your loans.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:26)', 'Speech': 'If you get a call, hang up. It’s not a joke, let’s be clear. Pay no attention to them, because you never have to pay for help with your federal student loans. Don’t listen to anyone who calls. I told you, just go online, it’s four questions. If you get any questions, please report to the following website, reportfraud.ftc.gov. My message to the fraudsters looking to cheat the American people is, don’t do it man, because we’re going to hold you accountable. We’re going to come for you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:06)', 'Speech': 'My administration is also taking additional steps to make education a ticket to the middle class that folks can actually afford. For example, we’re fixing what used to be called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. This program forgives student loans to encourage those students to go into public service, public school teachers, local police officers, workers at local charities, members of the military and the National Guard. If you serve in one of these jobs, and you make your loan payments for 10 years, even if it’s not consecutive years, the remainder of your balance will be completely forgiven. The change we made expires on October 31. Folks, move quickly. My message to all public servants out there with student debt is, apply today. Go to PSLF.gov to get that loan forgiven.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:08)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this message to the young people of this nation. I’ve always believed your generation, as I said, represented the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in our history. Today, we face an inflection point, one of those moments that only come every several generations, where there is so much change happening technologically, politically, socially, environmentally, that the decisions we make now are going to determine the future of our nation, and the future of your generation for the next 30 years. More change is going to occur in the next 10 years than the last 40 years that we’ve been around, not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:49)', 'Speech': 'Guess what? I know that you feel like it’s an added burden on top of all you’ve already been through. I’m not saying you have to shoulder the burden on your own. The task at hand, and the task ahead, is the work of all of us. What I’m saying is, you represent the best of us. Your generation will not be ignored. You’ll not be shunned, you’ll not be silenced. Just look at what happens when you speak out. Two years ago, perhaps many of you voted in your first election, or volunteered in your first election. You understood the choice, and the stakes. Because you exercised your right to vote, you elected me president, and Kamala vice president, the highest ranking woman ever to be elected in American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:36)', 'Speech': 'Since then, with your help, we’ve delivered enormous progress for the nation. More people voted in that last election than at any time in American history. The most significant gun safety law we’ve passed in 30 years, and by the way, I’m coming back, and I’m going to eliminate assault weapons again, I promise. I did it once. The most significant infrastructure law in American history, employing tens of thousands of people with good paying jobs, and modernizing our nation in a way it hadn’t happened since Eisenhower’s highway Bill. The first black woman on the Supreme Court, and she is smart as hell.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:26)', 'Speech': 'I made that promise. By the way, watch her, just watch her. Whoa. I’ve appointed more black women to the appellate courts of the United States than every other president combined in American history. The most significant commitment we’ve ever made to climate change. It’s the ultimate threat to your generation. Guess what? We have over close to a half a trillion dollars to deal with climate change. I’m keeping my promise that no one should be in jail for merely using or possessing marijuana, none. The records which hold up people from being able to get jobs and the like should be totally expunged. You can’t sell it, but if it’s just use, you’re completely free.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:29)', 'Speech': 'We know there’s more work to be done on voting rights, and restoring a woman’s right to choose. Today, my hope is, with the help of our delegation, if we maintain the Senate, pick up a of couple senators, we’re going to see to it that we completely codify Roe v. Wade in every state, a national codification.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:15)', 'Speech': 'Today, we’re following through on a promise I gave to millions of Americans with student loans, just a little more breathing room. Together, we’re making our democracy deliver for the American people. It strengthens all of America when those who come from struggling economic backgrounds, like a lot of us, when we do well, the whole country does well. The wealthy do well, everyone does well. I am so sick and tired of trickle down economics. I’ve had it up to here. Guess what? When poor folks and middle class folks make it, the wealthy do very well. They’re not at all hurt. I’m so sick and tired of telling me, “trickle down, give the wealthy more tax breaks, and everything’s going to be fine.” Yeah, right.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:02)', 'Speech': 'Folks, let me just say this. God bless you all for all you’re doing. I wish you all the very best of luck. The bottom line is, I want you to not forget, we still have a number of folks around the country in harm’s way, in the military. Every time we say grace, we end in my house, “God protect our troops.” Thank you very much.'}]"
https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-bidens-remarks-on-protecting-democracy-and-voter-intimidation-transcript,2022-11-03,President Biden’s Remarks On Protecting Democracy and Voter Intimidation Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:02)', 'Speech': 'All this happened after the assault and it just, it’s hard to even say. It’s hard to even say. After the assailant entered the home asking, “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?” Those are the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States Capitol on January the 6th, when they broke windows, kicked in the doors, brutally attacked law enforcement, roamed the corridors hunting for officials, and erected gallows to hang the former Vice President of Mike Pence. It was an enraged mob that had been whipped up into a frenzy by a president repeating over and over again the big lie that the election of 2020 had been stolen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:55)', 'Speech': 'It’s a lie that fueled the dangerous rise in political violence and voter intimidation over the past two years. Even before January the 6th, we saw election officials and election workers in a number of states subject to menacing calls, physical threats, even threats to their very lives. In Georgia, for example, the Republican Secretary of State and his family were subjected to death threats because he refused to break the law and give in to the defeated president’s demand, just find him 11,780 votes. “Just find me 11,780 votes.” Election workers like Shaye Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, were harassed and threatened just because they had the courage to do their job and stand up for the truth, to stand up for our democracy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:54)', 'Speech': 'This institution, this intimidation, this violence against Democrats, Republicans, and non-partisan officials just doing their jobs are the consequence of lies told for power and profit, lies of conspiracy and malice, lies repeated over and over to generate a cycle of anger, hate, vitriol, and even violence. In this moment, we have to confront those lies with the truth. The very future of our nation depends on it. My fellow Americans, we’re facing a defining moment, an inflection point. We must, with one overwhelming unified voice, speak as a country and say there’s no place, no place for voter intimidation or political violence in America, whether it’s directed at Democrats or Republicans. No place, period. No place ever.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:03)', 'Speech': 'I speak today near Capitol Hill, near the US Capitol, the citadel of our democracy. I know there’s a lot at stake in these midterm elections. From our economy, the safety of our streets, to our personal freedoms, the future of healthcare, social security, Medicare, it’s all important, but we’ll have our differences. We’ll have our difference of opinion, and that’s what it’s supposed to be. But there’s something else at stake; democracy itself. I’m not the only one who sees it. Recent polls have shown that overwhelming majority of Americans believe our democracy is at risk, that our democracy is under threat. They too see that democracy is on the ballot this year and they’re deeply concerned about it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:55)', 'Speech': 'So today, I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance, we must vote knowing what’s at stake, and not just the policy of the moment, but institutions that have held us together as we’ve sought a more perfect union are also at stake. We must vote knowing who we have been, what we’re at risk of becoming. Look, my fellow Americans, the old expression, freedom is not free, it requires constant vigilance. From the very beginning, nothing has been guaranteed about democracy in America. Every generation has had to defend it, protect it, preserve it, choose it, for that’s what democracy is. It’s a choice, a decision of the people by the people and for the people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:57)', 'Speech': 'The issue couldn’t be clearer in my view. We, the people, must decide whether we’ll have fair and free elections and every vote counts. We, the people, must decide whether we’re going to sustain a republic where reality is accepted, the law is obeyed, and your vote is truly sacred. We, the people, must decide whether the rule of law will prevail, whether we will allow the dark forces that thirst for power put ahead of the principles that we’ve long guided us. American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refused to accept the results of the 2020 election. He refuses to accept the will of the people. He refuses to accept the fact that he lost. He has abused his power and put the loyalty to himself before loyalty to the Constitution. And he’s made a big lie, an article of faith in the MAGA Republican Party, the minority of that party.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:11)', 'Speech': 'The great irony about the 2020 election is that it’s the most attacked election in our history, and yet, and yet there’s no election in our history that we can be more certain of its results. Every legal challenge that could have been brought was brought. Every recount that could have been undertaken was undertaken. Every recount confirmed the results. Wherever fact or evidence had been demanded, the big lie has been proven to be just that; a big lie, every single time. Yet now, extreme MAGA Republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections, but elections being held now and into the future. The extreme MAGA element of the Republican party, which is a minority of that party as I said earlier, but it’s its driving force, is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:30)', 'Speech': 'Instead of waiting until an election is over, they’re starting well before it. They’re starting now. They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It’s estimated that there are more than 300 election deniers on the ballot all across America, this year. We can’t ignore the impact this is having on our country. It’s damaging, it’s corrosive, and it’s destructive. And I want to be very clear, this is not about me, it’s about all of us. It’s about what makes America America. It’s about the durability of our democracy. For democracies are more than a form of government, they’re a way of being, a way of seeing the world, a way that defines who we are, what we believe, why we do what we do. Democracy is simply that fundamental, we must in this moment dig deep within ourselves and recognize that we can’t take democracy for granted any longer'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:46)', 'Speech': 'With democracy on the ballot, we have to remember these first principles. Democracy means the rule of the people, not the rule of monarchs or the monied, but the rule of the people. Autocracy is the opposite of democracy. It means the rule of one, one person, one interest, one ideology, one party. To state the obvious, the lives of billions of people from antiquity till now have been shaped by the battle between these competing forces, between the aspirations of the many and the greed and power of the few, between the people’s right for self-determination and the self-seeking autocrat, between the dreams of a democracy and the appetites of an autocracy. What we’re doing now is going to determine whether democracy will long endure. It, in my view, is the biggest of questions. Within the American system, the prize is the individual bends towards justice and depends, depends on the rule of law, whether that system will prevail.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:02)', 'Speech': 'This is the struggle we’re now in, a struggle for democracy, a struggle for decency and dignity, a struggle for prosperity and progress, a struggle for the very soul of America itself. Make no mistake, democracy is on the ballot for all of us. You must remember that democracy is a covenant. We need to start looking out for each other again, seeing ourselves as we, the people, not as entrenched enemies. This is a choice we can make. Disunion and chaos are not inevitable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:47)', 'Speech': 'There’s been anger before in America. There’s been division before in America, but we’ve never given up on the American experiment and we can’t do that now. The remarkable thing about American democracy is this, just enough of us on just enough occasions have chosen not to dismantle democracy, but to preserve democracy. We must choose that path again. Because democracy is on the ballot, we have to remember that even in our darkest moments, there are fundamental values and beliefs that unite us as Americans and they must unite us now. What are they? Well, I think first, we believe the vote in America is sacred, to be honored, not denied, respected, not dismissed, counted, not ignored. A vote is not a partisan tool to be counted when it helps your candidates and tossed aside when it doesn’t.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:53)', 'Speech': 'Second, we must, with an overwhelming voice, stand against political violence and voter intimidation, period. Stand up and speak against it. We don’t settle our differences in America with a riot, a mob, or a bullet, or a hammer, we settle them peaceably at the ballot box. We have to be honest with ourselves though. We have to face this problem. We can’t turn away from it. We can’t pretend it’s just going to solve itself. There’s an alarming rise in the number of our people in this country condoning political violence or simply remaining silent because silence is complicity. The disturbing rise of voter intimidation, the pernicious tendency to excuse political violence, or at least, at least trying to explain it away. We can’t allow this sentiment to grow. We must confront it head on now. It has to stop now. I believe the voices excusing or calling for violence and intimidation are a distinct minority in America, but they’re loud and they are determined. We have to be more determined. All of us who reject political violence and voter intimidation, and I believe that’s the overwhelming majority of the American people, all of us must unite to make it absolutely clear that violence and intimidation have no place in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:36)', 'Speech': 'And third, we believe in democracy. That’s who we are as Americans. I know it isn’t easy. Democracy isn’t perfect, it always has been. We are all called to defend it now, now. History and common sense tell us that liberty, opportunity, and justice thrive in a democracy, not in an autocracy. At our best, America is not a zero sum society or for you to succeed, someone else has to fail. I promise America’s big enough, it’s big enough for everyone to succeed. Every generation opening the door of opportunity just a little bit wider. Every generation, including those who’ve been excluded before. We believe we should leave no one behind, because each one of us is a child of God and every person, every person is sacred. If that’s true, then every person’s rights must be sacred as well. Individual dignity, individual worth, individual determination. That’s America, that’s democracy, and that’s what we have to defend.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:02)', 'Speech': 'Look, even as I speak here tonight, 27 million people have already cast their ballot in the midterm elections. Millions more will cast their ballots in the final days leading up to November the 9th, 8th, excuse me, and for the first time, this is the first time since the national election of 2020, once again we’re seeing record turnout all over the country, and that’s good. We want Americans to vote. We want every American’s voice to be heard. Now we have to move the process forward. We know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting or by mail in America and we know that many states don’t start counting those ballots till after the polls close on November 8th. That means in some cases we won’t know the winner of the election until a few days after the election. It takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner. It’s always been important for citizens in democracy to be informed and engaged. Now it’s important for citizens to be patient as well. That’s how this is supposed to work.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:20)', 'Speech': 'This is also the first election since the events of January 6th when the armed angry mob stormed the US Capitol. I wish, I wish I could say the assault on democracy had ended that day, but I cannot. As I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America for Governor, Congress, Attorney General, Secretary of State who won’t commit, they will not commit to accepting the results of election that they’re running in. This is a path to chaos in America. It’s unprecedented, it’s unlawful, and it’s un-American.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:04)', 'Speech': 'As I’ve said before, you can’t love your country only when you win. This is no ordinary year, so I ask you to think long and hard about the moment we’re in. In a typical year, we’re often not faced with questions of whether the vote we cast will preserve democracy or put us at risk, but this year we are. This year I hope you’ll make the future of our democracy an important part of your decision to vote and how you vote. I hope you’ll ask a simple question of each candidate you might vote for. Will that person accept the legitimate will of the American people, of the people voting in his district or her district? Will that person accept the outcome of the election, win or lose? The answer to that question is vital, and in my opinion, it should be decisive. On the answer to that question hangs the future of the country we love so much and the fate of the democracy that has made so much possible for us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:15)', 'Speech': 'Too many people have sacrificed too much for too many years for us to walk away from the American project in democracy. Because we’ve enjoyed our freedoms for so long, it’s easy to think they’ll always be with us no matter what. But that isn’t true today. In our bones, we know democracy is at risk, but we also know this; it’s within our power, each and every one of us, to preserve our democracy, and I believe we will. I think I know this country. I know we will. You have the power. It’s your choice, it’s your decision. The fate of the nation, the fate of the soul of America lies where it always does, with the people, in your hands, in your heart, in your ballot. My fellow Americans, we will meet this moment. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:25)', 'Speech': 'May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. May God bless those standing guard over our democracy. Thank you and Godspeed.'}]"

Throughout this election season, I’ve had the opportunity to meet with people from Texas to Florida, from New Hampshire to Arizona, and I’ve been met with incredible kindness in each place. Still, I always feel most at home on a college campus, so it’s so great to be at Bowie State. Thank you.And to Chris and all our distinguished Maryland leaders, thank you for your very warm welcome tonight. Americans across our country have inspired me and I’m grateful for every person who trusted me with their stories. They’ve reminded me of why we are fighting so hard in this election.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:56)', 'Speech': 'So are you ready to vote? Are you ready to win? This is it. We have a little more than 24 hours to get it done, and it’s going to be close. What we do right now will make the difference. So I want to talk to all you moms out there and everyone who has a never ending to-do list. I know you’re busy. I know you have your coffee before that sun rises, and you take the laundry out that you did the night before, just as your daughter is calling for clean socks. And I know how you spend your day jumping from meeting to meeting only to rush home just in time to make dinner. But this election is too important to sit out. So I’m asking you to put voting on the top of your to-do list.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:11)', 'Speech': 'Make a plan, write it down in big, bold letters, and help your friends and families and neighbors do the same, because that’s how we’re going to win, with one ballot cast, one phone call to remind your neighbor who might forget, one ride to the polling place, again and again, these small actions build up to something so much bigger than anything we can do alone. It starts with you. It starts with all of us. Digging a little deeper, working a little harder to elect Democrats up and down the ballots. So now here’s the good part. Sorry, Joe, not… So, he’s a veteran and a Rhode Scholar, a small business owner and a bestselling author, a CEO of one of the country’s largest anti-poverty organizations. And of course, he’s husband to Dawn and dad to Mia and James. Let’s have a round of applause for your next governor, Wes Moore.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:19)', 'Speech': 'Maryland, what’s going on?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:27)', 'Speech': 'We are so energized and ready. This is our time, Maryland. This is our time and we are so excited to be joined here by the first family, our President, Joe Biden, our First Lady, Jill Biden. I tell you, Madame First Lady, we are so grateful for your leadership and I want to give a special shout out to how you have supported higher education throughout your entire career. And I do want to give a special shout out also about the way that you’ve supported our community colleges. There are 16 remarkable community colleges here in the state of Maryland. And the first lady is right, I did end up as a Rhode Scholar, ended up becoming the first black Rhode Scholar in the history of Johns Hopkins University.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:28)', 'Speech': 'But I’m a very proud two year college, and the ring that I wear in my finger is from my two year college. I know my foundation, and we are going to support all of our students, and you have consistently done that, so thank you. Thank you. And I am so grateful to be here with each and every one of you, not just today, not just tomorrow, but for this entire journey, because this is our journey. This is our journey to make Maryland the place that lives up to the principle that I learned in my first days of army training, a principle that was simple, leave no one behind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:18)', 'Speech': 'And now I want to be clear, after tomorrow, if I am blessed enough, if I am blessed enough to be your next governor, we are going to make that the new mission of the state of Maryland. Maryland will be a state that leaves no one behind. It was interesting, it was interesting, Senator, the other day, a reporter actually asked a question. And they asked, they said, “Why are you all campaigning so aggressively?” And she said, “Haven’t you seen the polls?” So I told her, I said, there are three reasons why we continue to campaign so aggressively. The first reason why we continue to campaign so aggressively is this, this is how I plan on governing. Aggressively, with urgency and across every part of the state, so get used to it. The second reason is, because the only poll that matters is election day. And until those polls close tomorrow night, we are running like we are 10 points behind, we are running with urgency because we cannot just win an election we have to send a message. And the third reason is also simple, because the stakes are too high to do anything different.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:18)', 'Speech': 'The stakes are too high. These are uncertain times. These are uncertain times because we know that there are families who are struggling to put food on the table, that people simply want to feel safe in their own communities, in their own homes, and also in their own skin. We know that these can be uncertain times for families who want to make sure that their children are going to a safe and a quality public school. And I love you teachers. That people just simply want the opportunity to leave something behind to their children besides debt. But let’s be clear, these are uncertain times for democracy as well. The principles of a nation that I love are under a level of unprecedented assault, critical rights, like understanding that abortion is healthcare. And we are going to fight to make sure that Maryland is a safe haven for reproductive freedoms and reproductive health. And critical rights, like understanding that a democratic election should be honored and respected. And not letting and allowing Maryland to become a state where deciding to honor the results depends on what the results are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:13)', 'Speech': 'And I’m so thankful for the First Family for being here. So thankful. That’s right. Thankful for the partnership, and also thankful for the recognition and understanding that Maryland is ready to lead for being here. To understand and also underscore the fact that this is going to be Maryland’s moment. But I know that in order for us to accomplish any of this, we’ve got to do it together. Because, if we stand divided, we cannot win.'}]"

I’m a little hoarse.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:12)', 'Speech': 'Our democracy has been tested in recent years;, but with their votes, American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are. The states across the country saw record voter turnout; and the heart and soul of our democracy, the voters, the poll workers, the election officials, they did their job and they fulfilled their duty, and apparently without much interference at all. Without any interference, it looks like. And that’s a testament I think to the American people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:44)', 'Speech': 'While we don’t know all the results yet, at least I don’t know them all yet, here’s what we do know. While the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn’t happen. And I know you were somewhat miffed by my obsess and optimism, but I felt good during the whole process. I thought we were going to do fine. While any seat lost is painful, some good Democrats didn’t win last night. Democrats had a strong night, and we lost fewer seats in house representatives than any Democratic President’s first midterm election in the last 40 years, and we had the best midterm for governors since 1986.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:28)', 'Speech': 'And another thing that we know is that voters spoke clearly about their concerns about the rising cost and the need to get inflation down. There’s still a lot of people hurting; they’re very concerned. And it’s about crime and public safety. And they sent a clear and unmistakable message that they want to preserve our democracy and protect the right to choose in this country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:53)', 'Speech': 'And I especially want to thank the young people of this nation who I’m told, I haven’t seen the numbers, voted historic numbers again, just as they did two years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:12)', 'Speech': 'Last night I was pleased to call Maxwell Frost, a 25-year-old who got elected, I guess the youngest man ever elected to the United States Congress, and I told him that I was first elected the second youngest person ever elected in the United States Senate of ’29, that I have no doubt he’s off to an incredible start, and what I’m sure will be a long, distinguished career. And when he’s President and they say, “Joe Biden’s out in the outer office,” I know I’m going to say, “Joe who?” But the voters were also clear that they’re still frustrated. I get it. I understand it’s been a really tough few years in this country for so many people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:54)', 'Speech': 'When I came to office, we inherited a nation with a pandemic raging and an economy that was reeling, and we acted quickly and boldly to vaccinate the country, and to create a stable and sustained growth in our economy, long-term investment to rebuild America itself… our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, clean water systems, high-speed internet… and we’re just getting started. The interesting thing is that this is all going to really come into clear view for people in the months of January, February, March of next year. It’s just getting underway, so I’m optimistic about how the public is going to even be more embracive of what we’ve done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:32)', 'Speech': 'Historic investments that are leading companies to invest literally hundreds of billions of dollars combined to build semiconductor factories and other advanced manufacturing here in America. It’s going to create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. And by the way, a significant number of those jobs are going to be jobs that pay average $126,000, $127,000, and you don’t need a college degree to get those jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:58)', 'Speech': 'And we’re dealing with global inflation as a result of a pandemic and Putin’s war Ukraine. We’re also handling it better than most other advanced nations in the world. We’re lowering gas prices. We’re taking on powerful interest to lower prescription drug costs, and health insurance premiums, and energy bills.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:16)', 'Speech': 'After 20 months of hard work, the pandemic no longer controls our lives; it’s still a concern, but no longer controls our lives. Our economic policies created a record 10 million new jobs since I came into office. Unemployment rate is down from 6.4%, when I was sworn in, to 3.7%, near a 50-year low, and we’ve done all this while lowering the federal deficit in the two years by $1.7 trillion. Let me say it again: $1.7 trillion. No administration has ever cut the deficit that much. And reducing the federal deficit is one of the best things we can do to lower inflation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:56)', 'Speech': 'But while we’ve made real progress as a nation, I know it’s hard for folks to see that progress in their everyday lives, and it’s hard to see the results from actions that we took while we have to implement what we’ve done. But I believe we took the right steps for the country and for the American people. In fact, if you look at the polls, overwhelming majority… I don’t look at them much anymore because I’m not quite sure how to read them anymore; I hope you are uncertain as well… but overwhelming majority of American people support the elements of my economic agenda, from rebuilding America’s roads and bridges, to lowering prescription drug costs, the historic investment, and tackling the climate crisis, to making sure that large corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes. And I’m confident that these policies are working, and that we’re on the right path, and we need to stick with them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:54)', 'Speech': 'All these initiatives take hold as they do, from lead pipes being removed from schools and homes, to new factories being built in communities with a resurgence of American manufacturers. That’s already created, by the way, 700,000 brand new manufacturing jobs. You’ve heard me say ad nauseam. I don’t know where it’s written that says we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world. We are now exporting product, not jobs, around the world. People across the country are going to see even more clearly the positive effects on their day-to-day lives, but I still understand why they’re hurting right now and so many people are concerned.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:32)', 'Speech': 'As I have throughout my career, I’m going to continue to work across the aisle to deliver for the American people; and it’s not always easy, but we did it the first term. It surprised a lot of people that we signed over 210 bipartisan laws since I’ve become President, and we’re revitalizing American manufacturing, gun safety. We did it together. And dozens of laws positively impacting on our veterans.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:57)', 'Speech': 'Now, let me say this: regardless of what the final tally in these elections show, and there’s still some counting going on, I’m prepared to work with my Republican colleagues. The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:15)', 'Speech': 'In the area of foreign policy, I hope we’ll continue this bipartisan approach of confronting Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. When I return from the G20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I’m going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I’ve done in the past in my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress, to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States, and I’m open to any good ideas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:45)', 'Speech': 'I want to be very clear: I’m not going to support any Republican proposal that’s going to make inflation worse. For example, the voters don’t want to pay higher prescription costs for drugs. We’ve cut that now. We’re going to kick into gear next year, next calendar year, and I’m not going to walk away from the historic commitments we just made to take on the climate crisis. They’re not compromisable issues to me and I won’t let it happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:10)', 'Speech': 'The voters don’t want more tax cuts for the super wealthy and biggest corporations, and I’m going to continue to focus on cost-cutting for working and middle-class families, and building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. I know you’re tired of hearing me say that, but I genuinely mean it. That’s what makes America grow. The wealthy do very well when the middle-class is doing well, and the poor have a way up, and while continuing to bring down the federal deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:40)', 'Speech': 'As we look at tax cuts, we should be looking at tax cuts for working people and middle-class people, not the very wealthy; they’re fine. And look, if you can go out and be a multimillionaire, that’s great. Just pay your fair share. That’s all. Just pay your fair share. It’s like those 55 corporations in 2000 that made $40 billion and didn’t pay a penny in federal taxes. It’s not right. Everybody has an obligation. So now they have to pay a staggering 15%, and you all pay more than that for your taxes. So I’m going to keep my commitment that no one earning less than $400,000 a year, and that’s a lot of money where I come from, are going to see their federal taxes go up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:21)', 'Speech': 'And I want to be very clear: under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the senator from down in Florida, to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That’s not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion. But I’m ready to compromise with Republicans where it makes sense on many other issues, and I’ll always put the needs and interest in American people first.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:53)', 'Speech': 'Let me close this. On this election season, the American people made it clear they don’t want every day going forward to be a constant political battle. There’s too much of that going on, and there’s too much that we have to do. The future of America is too promising, too promising to be trapped in endless political warfare. And I really mean it. You’ve heard me say it time and again for the last 20 months or so. I am so optimistic about the prospects for America. We need to be looking in the future, not fixated on the past, and that future as bright as can be. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went into the crisis, and that’s a fact. I literally mean that. We’ve come out stronger than we’ve gone in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:41)', 'Speech': 'And I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today, particularly because of all those young people I’ve talked about, 18 to 30. They’re showing up. They’re the best educated generation in American history. They’re the least prejudiced generation in American history, the most engaged generation in American history, and the most involved. Look, after a long campaign season, I still believe it, always have: this is a great nation and we’re a great people, and it’s never been a good bet to bet against America. Never been a good bet to bet against America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. We just need to remember who the hell we are. We’re the United States of America. The United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. And I’m pretty well-convinced that we’re going to be able to get a lot done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:34)', 'Speech': 'Now, I’ve been given a list of 10 people that I’m supposed to call on. And you’re all supposed to ask me one question, but I’m sure you’ll ask me more. And so let me start off with the list I’ve been given.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:47)', 'Speech': 'Zeke Miller, Associated Press.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:42)', 'Speech': 'I think that the problem is the major piece of legislation we passed, and some of it bipartisan, takes time to be recognized. For example, you’ve got over a trillion dollars worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades put in the ground. It’s taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently, and then someone up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the congressman who got elected, and he said, “Can you help us make sure we’re able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York, New York City?” and I said, “Yeah, we can.” First of all, it’ll make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there, we voted for it, than the entire money we spent in Amtrak to begin with, and it’s the same way…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:37)', 'Speech': 'For example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we’re going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn’t take effect until next year. So there’s a lot of things that are just starting to kick-in. And the same way with what we’ve done in terms of the environmental stuff; it takes time to get it moving. So I’m'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:36)', 'Speech': 'I guess the best way to say this is to repeat what some of you heard me say before, the first G7 meeting for the public, that’s the seven largest democracies when I went to right after we got elected in February, after I got sworn in January. And I sat down at a table, a round table with the six other world leaders from the European Union and Canada, et cetera, and said, “America’s back.” And one of them turned to me and said, “For how long? For how long?” It was a deadly earnest question, for how long? And I looked at them and then another one went on to say, and I’m not going to name them, went on to say, “What would you say, Joe, if in fact we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the parliament of Great Britain, gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election?” It’s not the same situation obviously as we have. And he said, “What would you think?” And I asked the rhetorical question, “What would you all think? You’d think England was really in trouble. You’d think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:05)', 'Speech': 'And so that’s the way people were looking at us. Like, when’s this going to stop? Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don’t want to exaggerate, but literally nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. And so what I find is that they want to know, is the United States stable? Do we know what we’re about? Are we the same democracy we’ve always been? Because look, the rest of the world looks to us. I don’t mean like we’re always right, but if the United States tomorrow were to quote, “withdraw from the world,” a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change. And so they’re very concerned that we are still the open democracy we’ve been, and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that’s the context in which I think that they’re looking at, are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the court, by the congress, by the government, et cetera.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:39)', 'Speech': 'Your thinking? My guess is, I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away for a week around between Christmas and Thanksgiving and my guess is it’ll be early next year we make that judgment. But my plan to do it now, I mean, but you know. Okay. I’m'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:50)', 'Speech': 'But number one. So number one, what I’d do to try to change it is object to it before the Supreme Court of the United States, our administration. Number two, there are a number of things that we can and must do to make it… And by the way, this is a case involving an Asian American in terms of getting into school and whether affirmative action makes sense at all from the standpoint of those who are arguing against it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:24)', 'Speech': 'But the fact is that we’re also in a circumstance where there’s a lot that we can do in the meantime to make sure that there’s an access to good education across the board, and that is by doing things that relate to starting education at age three, formal schooling at age three, which increases not daycare but school. All the studies over 10 years show that increases the prospect of someone making it through 12 years without any difficulty, no matter what the background they come, from by 56%. And I also think that we should be making sure that we have the ability to provide for two years of education beyond that, whether it’s apprenticeships or community colleges. And we also are in a situation where I think that, for example, a lot of it has to do with finances as well, that we make sure that we have help for people who come from modest means to be able to get to school.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:28)', 'Speech': 'The cost of college education has increased fourfold, and it used to be that a Pell Grant would cover something like 70% of the college tuition. Now, it covers significantly less than that, so I want to increase the Pell Grants as well. But let’s see what the Supreme Court decides. And I am hopeful, and our team and the lawyers that argued for us are not nearly as certain as the people you quoted as saying it’s going to be overruled.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:07)', 'Speech': 'And the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and in the average Black community? One, prescription drug cost. Well, we’re driving those down precipitously, beginning next year. And I’ll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we’re reducing that cost. They’re not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of average of $400. And I can go down the list of the things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:42)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it’s done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community, and the poor and poorer communities, they need help. And so we’re driving down all of those costs, and we’ve already passed the legislation to do that. It’s just taking effect.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:13)', 'Speech': 'So there’s a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living, but I am optimistic because we continue to grow and at a rational pace. We are not anywhere near a recession right now in terms of the growth, but I think we can have what most economists call a soft landing. I’m convinced that we’re going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they in fact end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:58)', 'Speech': 'When my first wife and daughter were killed when a tractor-trailer broadsided and then killed my first wife and kill my daughter, and my two boys were expected to die. It took the jaws of life three hours to get them out of there, on top of their dead mother and dead sister. I understand what that pain’s like. And when Jill and I lost Bo after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star [inaudible 00:38:22] service medal, a major in the United States military, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived about between two and five hundred yards from a burn pit that’s 10 feet deep and as big as a football field, burning every toxic waste you could find.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:38)', 'Speech': 'I think that we understand what it’s like to lose family members, mothers, fathers to [inaudible 00:38:45]. All of you have been through that kind of thing. We’ve been fortunate, though. We’ve had each other. We’ve had strong families, Jill’s sisters, my brothers, my sister. And so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there’s help available, make sure there’s people who are there to help, whether they are a psychologist or whether they’re medical doctors, or whether they’re social workers, to be there to help, to help just hold a hand.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:13)', 'Speech': 'And for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you’re talking about. If we reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40% when it was in place. I couldn’t get it passed the second time around. So there’s a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it’s communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don’t understand, because I don’t want people having to know the pain. But the second piece of that is let them know that you are there to help. You’re there to help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:51)', 'Speech': 'And one of the things I’ve talked with the Vivek Murthy about, and a lot of you have written about it, and you’ve written well about it, is the need for mental health care in America. When we got elected, there were something like, I don’t know, 2, 3, 5 million people who had gotten their COVID shots? I’ve got over 220 million people all three shots, but in the meantime, what happened? We lost over a million dead. A million dead. I read one study that for those million people, each one had averaged nine people close to them. A relative, someone they’re married to, a child, someone close. The impact has been profound. Been profound.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:43)', 'Speech': 'Think of all the people. Think of all your children and your grandchildren who didn’t have that senior prom, who didn’t have that graduation party, who didn’t have all the things we had that we took for granted, that impact on their psyche. So there’s a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just in what a person demonstrates to understand, of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we’re trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it, too. I don’t mean this as a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we got a problem. Okay. Excuse me. These 10 questions are really going quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:34)', 'Speech': 'And so what I want to do with him when we talk is lay out what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interests of China, what I know to be the critical interests of the United States, and to determine whether or not they conflict with one another. And if they do, how to resolve it and how to work it out. And the Taiwan doctrine has not changed at all from the very beginning, the very beginning. So, I’m sure we’ll discuss China… Excuse me, Taiwan. And I’m sure we’ll discuss a number of other issues, including fair trade and relationships relating to his relationship with other countries in the region. Anyway, so there’s a lot we’re going to have to discuss. Do you want another question?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (47:52)', 'Speech': 'And so, we want to make sure that there’s a relationship that they’re able to defend themselves and take on what is purely the ugliest aggression that’s occurred since World War II on a massive scale, on the part of Putin, within Ukraine. And there’s so much at stake. So, I would be surprised if Leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say they’re not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine.'}]"

Senator Blumenthal and I had invited then Vice President Biden to come to Connecticut in the aftermath of Sandy Hook to talk to our state, our grieving and our hurting state, about the path forward.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:02)', 'Speech': 'After the speech, President Biden asked for time with the Sandy Hook families. And it won’t surprise you that he told his plane to wait for hours as he sat in a conference room at Western Connecticut State University until he had held every hand, hugged every grieving parent, and wiped away every tear.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:19)', 'Speech': 'He was two hours late for his plane when he walked out of that room. But at that time, of course, the cameras had all left. The reporters were gone and standing outside that conference room wasn’t Joe Biden the vice president. It was Joe Biden the person. And what happened next is something I’ll never forget.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:36)', 'Speech': 'He was already two hours late for his plane. But he didn’t leave because somebody told him that in another conference room across the hall were a different set of families, families that no one in America had really heard about, moms and dads who had lost their sons and daughters to gun homicides in Bridgeport, in New Haven, and Hartford. Joe Biden knew that their pain wasn’t any less debilitating than the pain of the Sandy Hook families. And so, he told his people that he wasn’t going anywhere. He walked into that second room, and he held every hand. He hugged every crying parent. He wiped away every tear.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:12)', 'Speech': 'And then for hours, I was there. I watched this happen. He sat in a chair and listened to every single parent tell one of the most powerful people in the world the story of their child, who he was and who he wouldn’t, and who he would’ve been if not for our nation’s gun laws. When Joe Biden’s term as vice president was over, he could have looked back on a career well done a public life that made enormous difference. He deserved a rest. And I guess I don’t know all the reasons why he decided to offer himself up for service again this time as president. He probably knew that he was the only person who could lead the country out of these dark days.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:53)', 'Speech': 'But having seen firsthand how much the pain of those parents from both Sandy Hook and Hartford meant to him, I think I know that he believed he still had work to do. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the First Gun Safety bill in 30 years would not have passed without Joe Biden’s leadership. It just wouldn’t have. And what I find so amazing about our president is that he didn’t wait a week after he signed that bill before he started demanding that Congress do more universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:36)', 'Speech': 'And so, on behalf of Senator Blumenthal and Congresswoman Hayes and the urging of the vigils organizers, we invited President Biden to join us here tonight. To many, it might have seemed like a long shot. But a lot of us knew that it wasn’t because we’ve seen President Biden when the cameras are on, like when he moved the country, almost single handedly to action after Buffalo and Uvalde. But also, we’ve seen him when the cameras are off. That’s why we’re so excited to have him here today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:13)', 'Speech': 'But the introduction of President Biden is not mine. But it will be Jackie Haggerty. Jackie Haggerty is a hero of mine as I mentioned. She was a second grade at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December, 2012. Her classroom was just across the hall from those classrooms we know so much about today. Today, she’s a courageous survivor, and she is a courageous advocate for tougher common sense gun laws. Jackie Haggerty.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:27)', 'Speech': 'There were moments in that classroom where I sat worrying that I would die, worrying that that door would burst open. And I would never go home see my mommy, daddy, and my siblings. But that door wasn’t opened until first responders had come to save us. That day, I survived because the shooter armed with an AR-15, chose the left instead of right in that hallway. The last 10 years have not been easy, but living my life honoring the victims has helped, being kind like Principal Dawn Hochsprung and choosing love like Jesse Lewis and so many others.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:01)', 'Speech': 'Tonight, family, friends and survivors gather from across the country to remember the people that were taken too soon by gun violence and make a commitment to honor the lives of those we love by taking action.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:15)', 'Speech': 'For the last decade, our childhood has been stolen by gun violence. Guns are now the number one killer of children in America. And we are asked to be brave while hiding under our desks in our classrooms while too many elected officials lack the courage to pass common sense laws to save our lives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:43)', 'Speech': 'Thankfully, we have a president who does more than send thoughts and prayers. He has already passed more executive actions on gun safety than any other president. And he has relentlessly pushed for a ban on weapons of war. He understands that we are living in fear and we have suffered enough. It is my privilege to introduce President Joe Biden, our gun safety champion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:04)', 'Speech': 'Folks, events like this are hard. They’re hard for all of you because it brings back the very moment that everything happened, no matter how many years pass, no matter how many years go by. And it brings it back. But your voices matter. Your voices matter a great deal. Rector Morgan, thank you for welcoming us to St. Mark’s, to remember, to heal and to fulfill a purpose.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:43)', 'Speech': '10 years ago, this nation’s vigil was created here in Washington to pray for the souls of Sandy Hook and their families, families. Ever since this, that time, this has been opening its doors to more victims and more families of a violence that rips at the very soul, at the very soul of this nation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:08)', 'Speech': 'To all of you here tonight, it’s under different circumstances, but I know a little bit what the loss feels like. It’ll be an anniversary on the 18th of this month that I lost my wife and daughter, and nearly lost my two sons when a tractor trailer broadsided them. And it’s not long after that, the anniversary of losing my son. I know that feeling. Everyone is different, but I know that feeling. It’s like a black hole in the middle of your chest you’re being dragged into. And you never know if there’s ever a way out. And what I admire so much about all of you is you show up and remember, because remembering brings it back the very moment that it happened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:05)', 'Speech': 'But all of you, and all of you at the time, and I spent several days up at Sandy Hook and then went back, at the time, it was astounding to see, even then, the courage that was represented. Jill and I met with you, prayed with you, and have worked with you. We’ve seen you turn pain into purpose. Together, we’ve made some important progress, the most significant gun law passed in 30 years, but still not enough. Still not enough.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:54)', 'Speech': 'Even as our work continues to limit the number of bullets that can be in a cartridge, the type of weapon that can be purchased and sold, the attempt to ban assault weapons, a whole range of things that are just common sense. Just simple common sense. But we did it before. You may remember in the ’90s we did it with the help of the very people in here, led by Speaker Pelosi in the House and many others. And we did it. And guess what? It worked. The number of violent mass murders reduced were significant. A lot of people’s lives were saved. And we can do it again. Scripture says, “The light shines in darkness, and darkness has not overcome it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:03)', 'Speech': 'To all of you here tonight, you are the light. You are literally the light. And your loved ones, your friends, they’re the light. And they’ll always be with you, no matter what happens. They’re always with you. How many of you ask yourself, “What would my son or daughter want me to do at this moment”? They’re in your heart. They’re part of you. They’re always going to be with you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:30)', 'Speech': 'And at this National Vigil for Victims of Gun Violence, I ask the country to join me in a moment of silence to remember every one of them. And we ask God to give us the strength to finish the work left undone done on behalf of the lives we’ve lost and all the lives we can save. May God bless you all and keep you safe.'}]"

We used to go to 07:30 mass, every morning in high school, and then onto college, before I went to the black church. Not a joke, Andy knows this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:33)', 'Speech': 'Andy, it’s so great to see you, man. You’re one of the greatest we’ve ever had. You really are, Andy. Andy and I took on apartheid in South Africa, and a whole lot else. They didn’t want to see him coming, but we used to… That’s where we’d organize, to march, and to segregate the city. My state was like yours, segregated by law, we were a slave state, to our great shame, and we had a lot of leftovers of the bad things, come from that period of time, but anyway, that’s another time, but I learned a lot, and I promise, if any preacher, preached to me back then, I’m not going to be nearly as long as you were. Actually, I have a bad reputation for speaking too long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:28)', 'Speech': 'He followed the path of Moses, a leader of inspiration, calling on the people, not to be afraid, and always, always, as my grandfather would say, keep the faith.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:45)', 'Speech': 'He followed the path of Joseph, a believer in dreams, in the divinity they carry, and the promise they hold.

On this day of remembrance, we gather at Dr. King’s, cherished Ebenezer. I say emphasize the word, cherished, Ebenezer. And by the way, sis, every good man, every good brother, needs a really, strong, strong sister. You think I’m kidding? I’m no Dr. King, and my sister’s not you, but I’d tell you what, she’s smarter, better looking, and better person, than I am. Managed all my campaigns.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:57)', 'Speech': 'Folks, you know, on this day of remembrance, as we gather here at his cherished Ebenezer, to commemorate what would’ve been, Dr. King’s 94th birthday. We gather to contemplate his moral vision, and to commit ourselves to his path, to his path, the path that leads to the beloved community, to the sacred place, that sacred hour, when justice rains down like waters and righteousness of the mighty stream. Folks, to the king family, I know, no matter how many years pass, doesn’t matter how many years pass, those days of remembrance are difficult. They’re bring everything back as if it happened yesterday. It’s hard for you. And I want to thank the King family, presumptions me to do this, but on behalf of the whole congregation, for being willing to do this, year in and year out, you give so much, so much to the rest of us, and we love you all, and we love you all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:12)', 'Speech': 'To fully honor Dr. King, we have to pay tribute to Mrs. Coretta Scott King, who we dearly miss.

One of those points in world history, where what happens the last few years, and will happen the next six or eight years, are going to determine, what the world looks like, for the next 30 to 40 years. It happened after World War two, it’s happening again, the world is changing. There is much at stake. Much at stake.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:41)', 'Speech': 'And the fact is, that this is the time of choosing. This is the time of choosing, direct choices we have. Are we a people, who will choose democracy, over autocracy? Couldn’t ask that question, 15 years ago. We thought democracy was settled, not for African Americans, but democracy, as an institutional structure, was settled, but it’s not. It’s not. We have to choose a community, over chaos. Are we the people are going to choose love, over hate? These are the vital questions of our time, and the reason why I’m here, as your president.

And so often, when people hear about Dr. King, people think of his ministry, and the movement, were most about the epic struggle for civil rights and voting rights.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:24)', 'Speech': 'But we do well to remember, that his mission was something even deeper. It was spiritual, it was moral. The goal of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King led, stated it clearly, and boldly, and it must be repeated again, now, to redeem the soul of America. I’m not joking. To redeem the soul of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:56)', 'Speech': 'What is the soul of America? It’s easy to say, but what is the soul of America? Well, the soul is the breath, the life, the essence of who we are. The soul makes us, us. The soul of America is embodied in the sacred proposition, that we’re all created equal in the image of God.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:19)', 'Speech': 'That was the sacred proposition, for which Dr. King gave his life. The sacred proposition rooted in scripture, and enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. The sacred proposition he invoked on that day in 1963, when he told my generation, about his dream. A dream in which, we’re all entitled to be treated with my father’s favorite word, dignity, and respect. A dream in which, we all deserve liberty and justice, and it’s still the task of our time, to make that dream a reality, because it’s not there yet'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:12)', 'Speech': 'To make Dr. King’s vision tangible, to match the words of the preachers and the poets, with our deeds. As the Bible teaches us, we must be doers of the word, doers of the word. The battle for the soul of this nation, is perennial. It’s a constant struggle. It’s a constant struggle, between hope and fear, kindness and cruelty, justice and injustice, against those with traffic in racism, extremism, and insurrection. A battle fought on battlefields and bridges, from courthouses and ballot boxes, to pulpits and protest. And at our best, the American promise wins out. At our best, we hear and heed the injunctions of the Lord, and the whispers of the angels.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:15)', 'Speech': 'What I don’t need to tell you, that we’re not always at our best. We’re fallible. We fail and fall, but faith, and history, teaches us, that however dark the night, joy cometh in the morning, And that joy, comes with the commandments of scripture. Love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, all thy mind, and all thy soul, and love thy neighbor as thy self. Easy to say, easy to say, but very hard to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:03)', 'Speech': 'But in that commandment, in my view, lies the essence of the Gospel, and the essence of the American promise. It’s when we see each other as neighbors, and not enemies, that progress and justice come. So when we see each other as fellow human beings, as children of God, that we bend, or begin to walk the path of Dr. King’s beloved community. A path his dream inspired, and his legacy propel us forward to this day.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:44)', 'Speech': 'Here’s what I learned in my life, and my career, along that path, as many of you, have learned along your path. We’re all imperfect being. We don’t know where, and what, fate will deliver to us, and when, but we can do our best, to seek a life of light, and hope, and love, and yes, truth, truth. That’s what I try to do every day, to build the future that we all want, or reminding ourselves, that nothing is guaranteed in our democracy. Nothing. Every generation is required to keep it defended, protected, to be repairs of the breach, and to remember that the power to redeem the soul of America, lies where it always has lay, in the hands of, we, the people, we, the people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:54)', 'Speech': 'I was vividly reminded of that truth, on the south lawn of the White House. I believe you were there, both of you, both your senators. On the south lawn of the White House, with our vice president, Kamala Harris. And hearing these words, and I quote, “It took just one generation, from segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States,” end of quote. Those are the words of Ketanji Brown Jackson, our Supreme Court justice. Took just one generation, from segregation, to the Supreme Court of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:53)', 'Speech': 'As I told folks, at the time, she’s smarter than you are. As Dr. King said, give us the ballot, and we will place judges on the bench, who will do justly. And we are. That’s the promise of America, where change is hard, but necessary.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:21)', 'Speech': 'Excuse me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:23)', 'Speech': 'Progress is never easy, but it’s always possible, and the things do get better, on our march toward a more perfect union. But at this inflection point, we know there’s a lot of work that has to continue on economic justice, civil rights, voting rights, and protecting our democracy, and I’m remembering, that our job is to redeem the soul of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:56)', 'Speech': 'Look, I get accused of being an inveterate optimist. I called that the Irish of it. We’re never on top, always stepped on, but we are optimistic, like Dr. King was optimistic. Folks, as I said, progress is never easy, but redeeming the soul of the country is absolutely essential. I doubt whether any of us would’ve thought, even in Dr. King’s time, that literally, the institutional structures of this country might collapse, like you’re seeing in Brazil, and we’re seeing in other parts of the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:53)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I’ll close with this, with a blessing, I see today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:00)', 'Speech': 'In the Oval Office, and many of you been there, been there in my office, you get to set it up the way you want, within reason. As I sit at my desk… As I sit at my desk, and look at the fireplace, just to the left, is the bust of Dr. King. It’s there in that spot on purpose, because he was my inspiration as a kid. He does know where we should go. I ran for three reasons. I said, I wanted to restore the soul of America, I wanted to rebuild this country from the bottom up in the middle out, And I want it united.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:01)', 'Speech': 'And not far from him, if you look, about 40, 50 degrees to the right, there is another statue, another bust of Rosa Parks. People ask me, “Why?” I say, and I put in my words, she just say, “I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:38)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I often think of the question that Dr. King asked us, all those years ago. I think is important, you all remember it, I think this is important, the nation remember it. He said, “Where do we go from here?” That’s a quote. “Where do we go from here?” Well, my message to the nation, on this day, is we go forward, we go together. When we choose democracy over autocracy, a beloved community over chaos, when we choose believers in the dreams, to be doers, to be unafraid, always keeping the faith. Every time I walk out of my Irish Catholic grandfather’s home, up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, his name was Ambrose Finnegan, and he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmother, “No Joey. Spread it. Spread the faith.” Now, I’m serious. This is a Catholic Rosary, I have on my wrist. One my son had on, the night he was dying. The point is, there’s hope, there’s always hope. We have to believe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:59)', 'Speech': 'And ladies and gentlemen, that was Dr. King’s path, in my view. The path to keeping the faith, and it must be our path. Folks, for God’s sake, this is the United States of America, the United States. There’s nothing beyond our capacity, nothing beyond our capacity, if we set our mind to it. And ladies and gentlemen, we’re a land of dreamers, and a land of doers. Nothing’s beyond our capacity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:31)', 'Speech': 'In the Gospel song, that Dr. King loved, as I understand, well, he always told he did. We’ve come too far, from where we started. Nobody told me that the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far, to leave me. He did not bring me this far, to leave me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:52)', 'Speech': 'My fellow Americans, I don’t think The Lord brought us as far, to leave us. I really don’t. My word, and may my fellow Americans, God bless Dr. Martin Luther King and his family, and based on one of his favorite hymns, “Precious Lord, take my hand, through the storm, through the night, and lead me onto the light.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:17)', 'Speech': 'May God bless you all, and let’s go find the light. We can do this. Amen.'}]"

Is there any organized labor, any unions in the house? You’re making it run, man. Well, Brandon Scott, thank you for the passport into this great city. And, Governor Wes Moore, Lieutenant Governor Miller, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you being here, and all the money you’ve committed to make this thing work as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:16)', 'Speech': 'And two of my best buddies in the United States Congress, I think, no hyperbole, two of the best United States senators I’ve ever served with, and I served there for 36 years in the Senate: Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. Ben and Chris, thank you, thank you, thank you. And Kweisi Mfume, I tell you what: When I get in real trouble, that’s the guy I call. There you are, sitting right in front. You helped us get so much of this done, including the project we’re here to celebrate. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:51)', 'Speech': 'Look, thanks to the members of the Maryland delegation and Congressman John Sarbanes. He and his dad and I talked a lot about Amtrak, spent a lot of time working on it. Dutch, you’re still here, aren’t you? There you go. Hey, Dutch. Good to see you. As well as Steny Hoyer. Probably one of the best Leaders we’ve ever had. Steny, you’re a hell of a guy. Where are you? For real. I’ve kidded Steny for years. I’ve kidded Steny for years. He represents the western shore of Delaware. We call it the Delmarva Peninsula. We get into it a little. At any rate, Steny, you’re the best and one of the greatest champions this state has ever had. And an incredible Majority Leader and continues to serve Maryland very well. I mean this sincerely: I don’t think there’s a better delegation in the entire United States of America than the delegation here in Maryland, including your state legislatures, as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:48)', 'Speech': 'And somebody who I was senior to but never referred to me as “Senator”, they’d always say “Biden, come here”: Barbara Mikulski. I wish Barb were here. She did a lot to make this day happen as well, all the years we worked on this. Baltimore particularly, Amtrak specifically.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:14)', 'Speech': 'And finally, it’s been over three years since… Oh, I didn’t know you had seats. Man, you ought to sit down. By the way, when I was running in 2020 for the job, I said, “Everybody take their seat,” and there were no seats. And the press said, “He is really stupid.” So, I don’t dare tell anybody to take a seat unless I see the chairs. But anyway, thank you. It’s been over three years since his passing, but my late friend, Elijah Cummings, he’s with us in the spirit and looking down and saying, “Joe, you finally got this sucker done.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:50)', 'Speech': 'And CEO Stephen Gardner. Stephen, he knows he’s got a strong supporter in Amtrak. Probably too strong. I’m driving him nuts already. I want to get it all done quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:01)', 'Speech': 'And Secretary Pete Buttigieg. This is just one example of the great work you’re doing, Pete. I appreciate it a lot. Let me at the outset, this is just the beginning, beginning of having a 21st century rail system that’s been so long overdue in this country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:18)', 'Speech': 'Back in Delaware, I’m known for riding Amtrak, for being their senator all those years. And most of you know that as a senator, I rode the train between Washington and Wilmington, and back and forth, every single day that the Senate was in. And they tell me it was about an average 117 days a year, about 265 miles a day. I put over a million miles on Amtrak, not a joke, including as Vice President. Amtrak wasn’t just a way to get home to family. The conductors, the engineers, they literally became my family. I used to have a summer party at my home in Delaware. Started off with about 10 conductors and engineers, ended up with about 70 people. They became my friends. I went to an awful lot of their children’s weddings and, unfortunately, funerals of them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:14)', 'Speech': 'When I was Vice President, I flew over a million miles on Air Force Two. And I was going home as the United States, as Vice President, and one of the conductors said to me, “Hey, Joe, big deal. A million, whatever, 200.” He said, “You’ve traveled over a million miles on Amtrak.” I said, “How the hell do you know that?” And they added up there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:36)', 'Speech': 'But, folks, look, I made a thousand trips through this tunnel, so I’ve been through this tunnel a thousand times. But when folks talk about how badly the Baltimore Tunnel needs an upgrade, you don’t need me to tell you. I’ve been there, and you’ve been there too. I also know that it’s not just Amtrak. I know how important this tunnel is to commuter rail and MARC rail back and forth to Washington. And I know how much it matters to the entire Northeast Corridor from here to Boston. It matters a great deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:12)', 'Speech': 'For years, people talked about fixing this tunnel. Well, I think I may be one of the few guys, back in the early ’80s, I actually walked into the tunnel with some of the construction workers. You ought to get inside and see it. This is a 150-year-old tunnel, and you wonder how in the hell it’s still standing. And with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, they’ll be finally getting it done. This law is the most significant investment in American roads and bridges since the Interstate Highway System, and it’s the single most significant investment in rail in America since Amtrak was created 50 years ago. And through the Infrastructure Law, we’re going to be investing over $4 billion to replace the existing Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel. And that’s why it’s so important.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:55)', 'Speech': 'Over 2,200 trains run on this corridor every single day, and it’s the busiest in the United States and one of the busiest corridors in the world. A problem anywhere along the line, up and down the East Coast, it means commuters are trying to get to and from work and they get in trouble, businesses trying to ship their goods, travelers trying to visit family. If this line shuts down, in just one day it would cost the country over $100 million. But this tunnel is a major checkpoint for 9 million Amtrak and MARC computer rail passengers who pass through it each and every year, a 1.4-mile stretch with a tight curve so that trains have to slow to 30 miles an hour.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:45)', 'Speech': 'You probably all heard this already, but it’s important. 99% of the weekdays, there’s been a delay here somewhere. Trust me, I know. This tunnel is nearly, as I said, 150 years old. This is Civil War era. Ulysses S. Grant was President. The structure is deteriorating, the roof is leaking, the floor is sinking. This is the United States of America, for God’s sake. We know better than that. And we know we have to prove we’re much better than that. Funding from the Infrastructure Law will fully replace this tunnel. And we’re naming the new tunnel after Frederick Douglass, who boarded this train to freedom right here in Baltimore. And he escaped slavery, he traveled the country by rail, fighting for abolition and civil rights. So that it’s fitting we honor him in this way, to Frederick Dougl…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:37)', 'Speech': 'Look, we have a lot to do. When the project is done, new trains will travel through this tunnel at 110 miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour. MARC trains will go from here to Washington in 30 minutes. On an average weekday, that’ll eliminate nearly seven hours a day. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel will be all electric, and we’ll continue to invest in rail to make it easier for people to use. Its potential to take thousands of vehicles off the highways, including the interstate, and save millions of barrels of oil, reducing pollution. All the studies show, if you can get from point A to point B by rail faster than you can by automobile, you take the rail. This is going to be a game changer for the environment as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:24)', 'Speech': 'And so, this is what we’re doing across the country, not just here. Tomorrow, I’ll be in New York for a similar announcement at the Hudson Tunnel Project, and a critical junction on the Northeast Corridor. Earlier this month, I was in Kentucky with the Republican Leader. And we’re standing there, and Republican governor and also Democratic leaders. Over a billion dollars is being spent on the Brent Spence Bridge over the Ohio River, connecting Ohio and Kentucky. We’re repairing the original bridge and building an entirely new one parallel to it. Each day, trucks carry about $2 billion worth of freight across that bridge from Florida to Canada. And it was built 60 years ago. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but now we’re finally going to get it done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:11)', 'Speech': 'And we’re not stopping there. We’re closing the digital divide. Nearly 175,000 households in Maryland who haven’t had access to high-speed Internet are now getting access to it through this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And our broadband program is estimated to create 200,000 jobs across the country just putting it in the ground. And it’s all union work. And today, we’re announcing a nearly $4 million grant to a great HBCU in Baltimore, Coppin State University, to buy new laptops and give students digital skills and training that they need to compete in today’s workplace.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:57)', 'Speech': 'The Army Corps of Engineers spends millions each year dredging to keep shipping channels clear at the Port of Baltimore and to help bring larger ships with more cargo in and out of Maryland. Now we’re investing another $84 million from the Infrastructure Law to take the dredged material and restore the Mid-Bay Islands on the Chesapeake, a critical habitat for fish and shellfish and birds, and these islands are central to the fishing and tourist industry.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:26)', 'Speech': 'There’s a lot we’re going to get done. And one of the things about the Infrastructure Law I’m most excited about is we’re doing all this with workers, with products made in America with union labor. In fact, today we’re announcing that this project will be built under a project labor agreement. These agreements are agreements that contractors and unions put in place before the construction begins. They ensure major projects are handled by well-trained, highly-skilled union workers. They resolve disputes ahead of time, ensuring safer work sites, avoiding disruptions and work stoppages that can cause expensive delays down the line. So, they’re not just good workers, they’re good taxpayers too. Amtrak and the building trades have agreed that the project labor agreement will be in place not just here in Baltimore but all across major rail construction projects up and down the Northeast Corridor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:35)', 'Speech': 'The Baltimore Tunnel Project will lead to 20,000 good-paying construction jobs: laborers, electricians, carpenters, cement masons, ironworkers, operating engineers, and so much more. These are good jobs you can raise a family on, and most don’t require a college degree, but they do require the equivalent of a college degree. You have to have four to five years of an apprenticeship. That’s one of the reasons they’re the best-trained workers in the world. The best in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:05)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been saying that my whole career, and it’s true. These are jobs for folks I used to think about as I took the train home at night going through the stretches of suburban Maryland, suburban Baltimore, and look out the window, see the flickering lights on people’s tables. Not a joke. I used to look and them and just wonder what their conversations were at their kitchen tables, their dining room table, what were they thinking about just before or after they put their kids to bed, asking questions that are ordinary and profound. “Are we going to have enough money left over, honey, at the end of the month, after we pay our bills, just to have a little bit of breathing room?” My dad used to say, “You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect.” It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, I mean this sincerely, it’s going to be okay.” And mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:58)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? Folks, too many people have been left behind in the past or treated like they’re invisible amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades. They remember. They remember the jobs that went away and wonder whether a path exists anymore for them to succeed. But I know we can forge a path of building an economy where no one’s left behind. That’s what this project and others like it across the country are all about. It’s about making investments in America’s cities, towns, heartlands in rural America. It’s about making things here in America again. It’s about good jobs. It’s about the dignity of work. It’s about respect and self-worth. And it’s about damn time we’re doing it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:49)', 'Speech': 'We went through four decades where we exported jobs and imported product. We’re exporting product and importing jobs now. For too long, we’ve talked about asserting American leadership and building the best economy in the world. But to have the best economy in the world, you have to have the best infrastructure in the world. That’s not hyperbole, it’s a fact to get products to market, to create thousands of good-paying jobs. For most of the last century, we led the world by a significant margin because we invested in our people. We invested in ourselves. We invested in research and development. Along the way, we stopped. We used to rank number one in the world in research and development. Now we rank number nine. China used to rank number eight. Now it ranks number two.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:38)', 'Speech': 'The risk of losing our edge as a nation and China and the rest of the world catching up is real. For decades, the backbone of America, the middle class, has been hollowed out. Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas because labor was cheaper. Jobs moved overseas and factories closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of themselves, what they used to be. When Carrier, one of the biggest manufacturers in Syracuse, New York, stopped making air conditioners, the town went into decline. Now, Micron’s enormous investment of semiconductors in Syracuse is bringing it all back and more. The same thing’s happened in Lordstown, Ohio, when GM shut down their auto factory. But this past year, thanks to all we’re doing with electric vehicles, GM and LG announced they’ll hire thousands of workers to build the new electric vehicle batteries. And when these towns were hollowed out, something else was lost: their pride, their sense of self-esteem.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:40)', 'Speech': 'Folks, these are the effects of so-called trickle-down economics. The view from Park Avenue that says, “When the wealthy do well, it will all trickle down to everybody else.” Not in the family I was raised in. It didn’t work that way. But there’s another one that I hold, that folks in Baltimore hold as well. Our folks in cities who were born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Claymont, Delaware, like I did, they view the backbone of America, they are the backbone. They are the people who get up every morning and go to work just to bust their necks trying to make an honest living. Look, folks, I’ve said it many times: Wall Street did not build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class. That’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:33)', 'Speech': 'I ran for President to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to bring back good-paying jobs you can raise a family on whether or not you went to college, to give working families a little more breathing room, to invest in ourselves again, to invest in America again. And that’s what we’ve done. My first two years in office, we had two of the strongest years of economic growth and job growth in American history. We’ve created 11 million new jobs, including 750,000 manufacturing jobs, and we’re just getting started. Where in God’s name is it written that America can’t lead the world of manufacturing again? I don’t know where that’s written.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:14)', 'Speech': 'In addition, there’s been major private investments totaling nearly $300 billion in American manufacturing, including for semiconductors and small computer chips that power virtually everything in our lives from cellphones to automobiles to artificial intelligence. What a lot of people don’t remember or don’t know: We invented the computer chip in America. We invented it, and we made it more sophisticated. 30 years ago, America had more than 30% of global chip production, worth tens of billions of dollars. But today, we produce only around 10% of the world’s chips. Instead of the supply chain for these chips starting with us, it starts with countries we can’t rely on. New automobiles need up to 3,000 of those chips just to be made. When overseas factories that make these chips shut down during a pandemic, automakers in America had to shut down their product lines too. We couldn’t produce enough cars because we didn’t have enough chips. We can’t ever let that happen again. That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, and we’re seeing the results now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:33)', 'Speech': 'Just a few hours north of here, IBM invested $20 billion in its facility in Poughkeepsie, New York, in semiconductor design and manufacturing, quantum computing, artificial intelligence. Intel is investing $20 billion building two chip factories, fabrication facilities just outside of Columbus, Ohio. 100 billion with Micron in Syracuse. 40 billion with TMSC in Phoenix. Our economic agenda has ignited a boom in manufacturing, from semiconductors to electric vehicles to advanced batteries that are going to power those vehicles. And in addition to that, anybody from the IBEW here? 500,000 charging stations you’re going to build in America, so you can go from coast to coast to coast.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:25)', 'Speech': 'Look, there’s much more to say about what we’re going to be doing to modernize American rail. But let me close with this, because if we don’t get it by a quarter after, we’re all here for the next two hours almost. When America sees these projects popping up across the country, it sends a really important message: When we work together, there’s not a damn thing we can’t do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We can move this. We can move this nation forward. And it sends another message as well: the message of pride. Pride in our country. Pride in what we can do when we do it together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:07)', 'Speech': 'You’ve heard me say it, and I apologize for repeating, but as long as I’m here, I’m going to say it: That it has never been a good bet to bet against America. Never. And I can honestly say, as I stand here today, I have never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who in God’s name we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. We’ve never failed to meet an objective when we set our mind to it. So, it’s about time we say, once again, we’re going to lead the world the second quarter of the 21st century. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}]"

The view that American workers are ready to work harder than anyone else, they just need a shot. I really mean it, all they need is a shot. They get up every morning and go to work and bust their necks trying to make an honest living. My dad used to say, and he literally would say this, he said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck… It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay, and he meant it, not a joke.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:32)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’ve said it many times… Wall Street, important as it is, didn’t build this country.

Buying American is not [inaudible 00:11:35], by that I mean the government is buying American. My administration, there’s a law back in the early thirties, that we never paid much attention to, and it said, when the president spends your tax dollars to put a new deck in an aircraft carrier, or build a highway, it should be built by Americans and American products.

Buying American is a reality.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:04)', 'Speech': 'We just made a lot of progress overseas as well, in the past two years… Jobs are up, wages are up, inflation is down, and COVID no longer controls our lives.

Look, you may remember when, during the off year election, I started talking about MAGA Republicans in democracy, and a lot of you thought, what hell’s he talking about? Why isn’t he talking about A, B, C, or D specific issue? Well, guess what? This is not your father’s Republican Party.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:43)', 'Speech': 'No, really think about it. These aren’t conservatives… These aren’t conservatives, these are disruptive people. They intend to destroy the progress we made. Folks, as I said, this is not your father’s Republican Party. Just take a look at what they’re doing… They campaigned on fiscal responsibility, but the first bill to pass in the House of Representatives added $114 billion to the deficit. First one. They introduced another bill, to limit president’s authority over the strategic petroleum reserve, because they’re mad I used that authority to lower gas prices by a $1.50 a gallon, period.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:20)', 'Speech': 'Look, they introduced a bill… When I said this stuff in the off year, people looked at me like I was nuts.

You’re going to see sea levels rising up to three feet. That means we carry a heavy responsibility, and it means we have an extraordinary opportunity as well. An extraordinary opportunity to build the future we want for our children and our grandchildren. It hadn’t been available to us in the past.

We’re the only country that has emerged from every crisis we’ve ever entered stronger than we got into it. Look folks, that’s what we’re doing again. Two years ago, the economy is reeling. I stand here tonight after we’ve created with the help of many people in this room 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president’s created in four years because of you all because of the American people. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much. And today, COVID no longer controls our lives. And two years ago, democracy faced its greatest threats in the Civil War. And today, though bruised our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:46)', 'Speech': 'As we gather here tonight, we’re writing the next chapter in the Great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, they do believe it or not, I said, I can define it in one word and I mean this, possibilities. We don’t think anything is beyond our capacity. Everything is a possibility. We’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together but over the past two years, we’ve proved the cynics and naysayers wrong. Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone, but time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together. Came together to defend us stronger and safer Europe. We came together to pass once in a generation infrastructure law, building bridges, connecting our nation and our people. We came together to pass most significant law ever, helping victims exposed to toxic burn pits. It was important. And in fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President. From re authorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love. And to my Republican friends, if we could work together the last Congress, there’s no reason we can’t work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:45)', 'Speech': 'Folks, you all are as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message, fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere. That’s always been my vision of our country, and I know it’s many of yours. To restore the soul of this nation, to rebuild the backbone of America, America’s middle class, and to unite the country. We’ve been sent here to finish the job in my view. For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out and not no one administration, but for a long time. Too many good paying manufacturing jobs move overseas, factories closed down, once thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be. Along the way, something else we lost, pride, our sense of self-worth. I ran for president to fundamentally change things, to make sure our economy works for everyone. So we can all feel that pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up. And the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. I know a lot of you always kidding me for always quoting my dad, but my dad used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck.” He really would say this. It’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” And mean it. Folks, so let’s look at the results. We’re not finished yet by any stretch of the imagination, but unemployment rate is at 3.4%, a 50 year low. Near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers. We’ve already created your help 800,000 good paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years. And where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing? And I don’t know where that’s written. For too many decades, we imported projects and exported jobs. Now thanks to what you’ve all done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:24)', 'Speech': 'Folks, inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic disrupted our supply chains. And Putin’s unfair and brutal war in Ukraine disrupted energy supplies as well as food supplies blocking all that grain in Ukraine. But we’re a better positioned than any country on earth right now, but we have more to do. But here at home, inflation is coming down. Here at home gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak, food inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down. Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up. Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses, 10 million. And by the way, every time someone start a small business is an act of hope and Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure the small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws reenacted that are going to just come into being. Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilities, semiconductors, small computer CHIPS the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cell phones to automobiles and so much more. These CHIPS were invented in America. Let’s get that straight. They were invented in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:02)', 'Speech': 'We used to make 40% of the world’s CHIPS. In the last several decades we lost our edge, we’re down to only producing 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas. Today’s automobiles need 3000 CHIPS each of those automobiles. But American automobiles couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough CHIPS. Car prices went up, people got laid off so did everything from refrigerators, to cell phones. We can never let that happen again. That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. Folks, I know I’ve been criticized for saying this, but I’m not changing my view. We’re going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America. The supply chain begins in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:16)', 'Speech': 'We’ve already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law before the law kicks in. With this new law, we’re going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country, and I mean all across the country, throughout not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well. That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investment in American manufacturing over the next few years. Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel’s building a semiconductor factories on 1,000 acres, literally a field of dreams. It’s going to create 10,000 jobs that one investment, 7,000 construction jobs, 3000 jobs in those factories once they’re finished, they call them factories. Jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year and many do not require a college degree.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:13)', 'Speech': 'Because we work together these jobs where people don’t have to leave home to search for opportunity. And it’s just getting started. Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big, the medium-sized businesses, so much more that’s going to be needed to support those 3000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built. Talk to mayors and governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means for their communities. We’re seeing these field of dreams transform to the heartland, but to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world. And folks, as you all know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure, we’ve sunk to 13th in the world. The United States of America, 13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure. But now we’re coming back because we came together and passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s interstate highway system. And folks already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland. Projects that are going to put thousands of people to work, rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high speed internet, all across America, urban, rural, tribal. And folks, we’re just getting started. We’re just getting started.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:07)', 'Speech': 'And I mean it sincerely. I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law and my Republican friends who voted against it as well. But I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well. But don’t worry, I promised I’d be a president for all Americans. We’ll fund these projects and I’ll see you at the groundbreaking. Look, this law will further unite all of America. Projects like Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio River built 60 years ago, badly needed repairs. One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:24)', 'Speech': 'And while I was there, I met a young woman named Sarah who’s here tonight. I don’t know where Sarah is. Is she up in the box? I don’t know. Sarah, how are you? Well, Sarah for 30 years… For 30 years I learned, she told me she’d been a proud member of the Ironworkers Local 44 known as known as the Cowboys in the sky. The folks who built Cincinnati skyline. Sarah said she can’t wait to be 10 stories above the Ohio River, building that new bridge. God bless her. That’s pride. And that’s what we’re also building, we’re building back pride.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:14)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re also replacing poisonous led pipes that go into 10 million homes in America, 400,000 school and childcare centers. So every child in America, every child in America can drink the water instead of having permanent damage to their brain. Look, we’re making sure that every community, every community in America has access to affordable high speed internet. No parents should have to drive by McDonald’s parking lot to help to do their home work online with their kids, which many thousands were doing across the country. And when we do these projects, and again I get criticized for this, but I make no excuses for it. We’re going to buy American. We’re going to buy American, folks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:07)', 'Speech': 'And it’s totally consistent with international trade rules. Buy American has been the law since 1933, but for too long past administrations Democrat and Republican and fought to get around it. Not anymore. Tonight I’m announcing new standards require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America. Made in America. I mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:52)', 'Speech': 'Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cable, and on my watch American roads, bridges and American highways are going to be made with American products as well. Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. So many of you listening to me tonight, I know you feel it. So many of you felt like you’ve just simply been forgotten amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades. Too many people have been left behind and treated like they’re invisible. Maybe that’s you watching from home. Remember the jobs that went away? You remember them, don’t you? The folks at home remember them. You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away. Well, that’s why… I get that. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one’s left behind. Jobs are coming back. Pride is coming back. Because choices we made in the last several years, this is my view of blue collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:06)', 'Speech': 'For example, too many of you lay in bed at night like my dad did, staring at the ceiling wondering what in God’s name happens if your spouse gets cancer, or your child gets deadly ill, or something happens to you. What are you going to do? You going to have the money to pay for those medical bills? Or are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it? I get it, I get it. With the inflation reduction act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring healthcare costs down so you can sleep better at night with more security.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:49)', 'Speech': 'We pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Let me say it again. We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on earth. For example, one in 10 Americans has diabetes. Many of you in this chamber do, and in the audience. But every day millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive. Insulin’s been around for over a hundred years. The guy who invented it didn’t even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone. It cost the drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make that insulin, packaging and all you may get up to $13. But big pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars, $400 to $500 a month, making record profits. Not anymore. Not anymore. So many things that we did are only now coming to fruition. We said we were doing this and we said we passed the law to do it, but people didn’t know because the law didn’t take effect until January one of this year. We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. People are just finding out. I’m sure you’re getting the same calls I’m getting. Look, there are millions of other Americans who do not or are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with type one diabetes who need this insulin to stay alive. Let’s finish the job this time. Let’s cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $35. Folks, big pharma’s still going to do very well. I promise y’all. I promise you they’re going to do very well. This law also caps and will only go into effect on the 2025. It caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year. You don’t have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are. Because you know why? You all know it. Many of you, like many of my family have cancer. The drugs can range from $10,000, $11,000, $14,000, $15,000 for the cancer drugs. And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay Medicare back the difference.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:50)', 'Speech': 'We’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money, it cuts the Federal deficit by billions of dollars. By hundreds of billions of dollars. Because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by Medicare to keep their commitment to the seniors. Well guess what? Instead of paying $400 or $500 bucks a month, you’re paying $15. That’s a lot of savings for the Federal government. And by the way, why wouldn’t we want that? Now some members here are threatening, and I know it’s not an official party position, so I’m not going to exaggerate. But threatening to repeal the inflation reduction act. As my coach, that’s okay, that’s fair.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:53)', 'Speech': 'As my football coach used to say, lots of luck in your senior year. Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription jobs, I will veto it. Look, I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurers now than ever in history. A record 16 million people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. And thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums. And by the way, that law was written and the benefit expires in 2025. So my plea to some of you, at least in this audience, let’s finish the job and make these savings permanent. Expand coverage of Medicaid.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:58)', 'Speech': 'Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change, ever. Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future. I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, drought, storms, and wildfires from Arizona and New Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian border. More timber has been burned that I’ve observed from helicopters, than the entire state of Missouri. And we don’t have global warming? Not a problem. In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico, to Florida, to Idaho, we’re rebuilding for the long term. New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and prevent those forest fires. Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood. Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:56)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed and across the country by tens of thousands of IBW workers. And we’re helping families save more than a thousand dollars a year with tax credits to purchase electric vehicles and efficient appliances, energy efficient appliances. Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land. Let’s face reality, the climate crisis doesn’t care if you’re in a red or blue state. It’s an existential threat. We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America at last is stepping up to the challenge. We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what? No, we do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:51)', 'Speech': 'But there’s so much more to do. We got to finish the job. And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Just begin.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:13)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’m a capitalist. I’m a capitalist, but pay your fair share. I think a lot of you at home, a lot of you at home agree with me and many people that you know the tax system is not fair. It is not fair. Look, the idea that in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal taxes? Zero? Folks, it’s simply not fair. But now because of the law I signed, billion dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%. God love them. 15%, that’s less than a nurse pays.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:14)', 'Speech': 'And I need to be a crystal clear. I said at the very beginning, under my plans, as long as I’m President, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in taxes. Nobody. Not one penny. Well let’s finish the job. There’s more to do. We have to reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax. There’s a thousand billionaires in America. It’s up from about 600 at the beginning of my term, but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a school teacher or firefighter. I mean it. Think about it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:51)', 'Speech': 'Look… I know y’all are enthusiastic about that. But think about it. Think about it. Have you noticed big oil just reported it’s profits, record profits. Last year they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis. I think it’s outrageous. Why? They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production. And when I talked to a couple of them, they say, “We’re afraid you’re going to shut down all the oil wells, all the oil refineries anyway. So why should we invest in them?” I said, “We’re going to need oil for at least another decade and that’s going to exceed. And beyond that, we’re going to need it, production.” If they had in fact invested in the production to keep gas prices down. Instead, they used the record profits to buy back their own stock. Rewarding the CEOs and shareholders.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:05)', 'Speech': 'Corporations ought to do the right thing. That’s why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments. They’ll still make considerable profit. Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes. Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. That’s being fiscally responsible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:45)', 'Speech': 'In the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history. Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row, because those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor. Nearly 25% of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone, the last one. They’re the facts. Check it out. Check it out.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:29)', 'Speech': 'How did Congress respond to that debt? They did the right thing. They lifted the debt ceiling three times without pre-conditions or crisis. They paid American bills to prevent an economic disaster of the country. So tonight I’m asking the Congress to follow suit. Let’s commit here tonight to the full faith in credit in the United States America will never ever be questioned. Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage. I get it. Unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:07)', 'Speech': 'Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and social security to sunset. I’m not saying it’s a majority. Let me give you, anybody who doubts it. Contact my office, I’ll give you a copy. I’ll give you a copy of the proposal. That means Congress doesn’t vote. Well, I’m glad to see you. I’ll tell you, I enjoy conversion. It means if Congress doesn’t keep the programs the way they are, they’d go away. Other Republicans say, I’m not saying it’s a majority of you. I don’t even think it’s even a significant… But it’s being proposed by individuals. I’m politely not naming them, but it’s being proposed by some of you. Look folks, the idea is that we’re not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don’t respond.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:12)', 'Speech': 'So folks, as we all apparently agree, social security and Medicare is off the books now, right? They’re not to going be struck? All right, we got unanimity. Social security and Medicare are lifeline for millions of seniors. Americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they start. So tonight, let’s all agree and we apparently are, let’s stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them. We’ll not cut social security, we will not cut Medicare. Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned it. And if anyone tries to cut social security, which apparently no one’s going to do, and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I’ll stop them. I’ll veto it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:27)', 'Speech': 'And look, I’m not going to allow them to be taken away. Not today, not tomorrow, not every, but apparently it’s not going to be a problem. Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to lay down their plan as well. I really mean it. Let’s sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together. Let’s do that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:59)', 'Speech': 'I can tell you, the plan I’m going to show is going to cut the deficit by another $2 trillion. And I won’t cut a single bit of Medicare or social security. In fact, we’re going to extend the Medicare Trust fund at least two decades because that’s going to be the next argument. How do we keep it solvent, right? Well, we’ll not raise tax of anyone making under 400,000, but we’ll pay for it the way we talked about, by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:28)', 'Speech': 'Look, here’s the deal. They aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer. Here’s my message to all of you out there. I have your back. We’re already preventing Americans from receiving surprise medical bills, stopping $1 billion surprise bills per month so far. We’re protecting seniors life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud,'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:12)', 'Speech': 'Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It’s extortion. It’s exploitation. Last year I cracked down with the help of many of you on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday good coming into the country. I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businessmen, and consumers. Let’s finish the job. Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage. My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more. For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is canceled or delayed. We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts, by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year. We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $ 8.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:33)', 'Speech': 'Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in and many of you did. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month. They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it. Not anymore. We’ve written a bill to stop it all. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act. We’re going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill. Those fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (44:16)', 'Speech': 'The idea that cable, internet and cellphone companies can charge you $200 or more if you decide to switch to another provider, give me a break. We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront. And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging $50 round trip for a family just to be able to sit together. Baggage fees are bad enough. Airlines can’t treat your child like a piece of baggage. Americans are tired of being … We’re tired of being played for suckers. So pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:02)', 'Speech': 'For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore. We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work. For example, I should have known this but I didn’t until two years ago: 30 million workers had to sign noncompete agreements with the jobs they take. 30 million. So a cashier at a burger place can’t walk across town and take the same job at another burger place to make a few bucks more. It just changed. Well, they just changed it because we exposed it. That was part of the deal, guys. Look it up. But not anymore. We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:48)', 'Speech': 'And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, but the right. I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing. Pass the PRO Act because businesses have a right, workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers have a living wage. Let’s make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family medical leave, affordable child care. That’s going to enable millions more people to go and stay at work.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (46:37)', 'Speech': 'And let’s restore the full child tax credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history. And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth. So let’s finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing. Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. Let’s give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones. Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care and services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (47:23)', 'Speech': 'These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them. Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class. When we made public education, 12 years of it, universal in the last century, we became the best-educated, best-paid nation in the world. But the rest of the world has caught up. It’s caught up. Jill, my wife, who teaches full time, has an expression, I hope I get it right, kid. “Any nation that out-educates us is going to outcompete us. Any nation that out- educates us is going to outcompete us.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:02)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of the 21st century. If you want to have the best-educated work force, let’s finish the job by providing access to preschool for three- and four-years-old. Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a two- or four-year degree, no matter their background they came from. Let’s give public-school teachers a raise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:34)', 'Speech': 'We’re making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell grants for working- and middle-class families. Let’s finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school. Provide access to two years of community college, the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree. Let’s offer every American a path to a good career whether they go to college or not.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (49:16)', 'Speech': 'And folks, folks in the midst of the COVID crisis, when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything, let’s recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself. While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people and the ingenuity of medicine, we’ve broken the COVID grip on us. COVID deaths are down by 90%. We’ve saved millions of lives and we’ve opened our country back up. And soon we’ll end the public health emergency. That’s called a public health emergency, but we’ll remember the toll and pain that’s never going to go away. More than a million Americans lost their lives to COVID. A million. Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:21)', 'Speech': 'Remembering them, we remain vigilant. We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments. So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe. And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, we’re also got to double down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:45)', 'Speech': 'Before I came to office, you remember, during that campaign, the big issue was about inspector generals who would protect taxpayers’ dollars who were sidelined. They were fired. Many people said we don’t need them. And fraud became rampant. Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars. Now, let’s triple the anti-fraud strike force going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars, billions of dollars, from the American people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:40)', 'Speech': 'And the data shows that for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, the taxpayers get back at least 10 times as much. It matters. It matters. Look, COVID left its scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. We have an obligation to make sure all people are safe. Public safety depends on public trust, as all of us know. But too often that trust is violated.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:13)', 'Speech': 'Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, welcome, who had to bury Tyre last week. As many of you personally know, there’s no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine, imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law. Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street, or playing in the park or just driving a car. Most of us in here have never had to have the talk, the talk, that Brown and Black parents have had to have with their children. Beau, Hunter, Ashley, my children, I never had to have the talk with them. I never had to tell them if a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:28)', 'Speech': 'Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car. Here’s what Tyre’s mother shared with me when I spoke to her, when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out. The faith in God, she said her son was, “A beautiful soul and something good will come of this.” Imagine how much courage and character that takes. It’s up to us, to all of us. We all want the same thing. Neighborhoods free of violence. Law enforcement who earns the community’s trust. Just as every cop when they pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:23)', 'Speech': 'Equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other in America. We know police officers put their lives on the line every single night and day. And we know we ask them in many cases to do too much, to be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises and so much more. In one sense we ask much too much of them. I know most cops and their families are good, decent, honorable people, the vast majority. But they risk, and they risk their lives every time they put that shield on. But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often. We have to do better. Give law enforcement the real training they need, hold them to higher standards, help them succeed in keeping us safe. We also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health substance abuse challenges. More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime, more community intervention programs, more investments in housing, education and job training. All this can help prevent violence in the first place. And when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (56:05)', 'Speech': 'With the support of the families of victims, civil rights groups and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants and other key elements of the George Floyd Act. Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyler’s mom true: Something good must come from this. Something good. And all of us, all of us. Folks, it’s difficult but it’s simple. All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment. We can’t turn away. Let’s do what we know in our hearts that we need to do. Let’s come together to finish the job on police reform.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (57:19)', 'Speech': 'Do something. Do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with every one of them. Do something about gun violence. Thank God, thank God we did. Passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades. That includes things like that the majority of responsible gun owners already support: enhanced background checks for 18- to 21-year-olds. Red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (57:55)', 'Speech': 'But we know our work is not done. Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero. Brandon put his college dreams on hold to be at his mom’s side, his mom’s side when she was dying from cancer. And Brandon now works at the dance studio started by his grandparents. And two weeks ago, during the Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio door close and he saw a man standing there pointing a semiautomatic pistol at him. He thought he was going to die, but he thought about the people inside. And in that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio, 11. He saved lives. It’s time we do the same. Ban assault weapons now. Ban them now, once and for all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (59:13)', 'Speech': 'I led the fight to do that in 1994. In 10 years that ban was law, mass shootings went down. After we let it expire in a Republican administration, mass shootings tripled. Let’s finish the job and ban these assault weapons. And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue once again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (59:37)', 'Speech': 'We know we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months. We’ve launched a new border plan last month. Unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela has come down 97% as a consequence of that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:00:07)', 'Speech': 'But American border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts. If we don’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, essential workers. Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms. Congress must restore the right, and the … Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v. Wade and protect Roe v. Wade. Give every woman the constitutional right.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:01:04)', 'Speech': 'The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans. Make no mistake about it: If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it. But let’s also pass, let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:01:45)', 'Speech': 'Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching. I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal attack against Ukraine. A murderous assault, evoking images of death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II. Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy? For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season on would-be aggressors and threatens our prosperity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:02:39)', 'Speech': 'One year later, we know the answer. Yes, we would, and we did. We did. And together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO. We built'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:03:26)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Because we’re going to stand with you as long as it takes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:03:45)', 'Speech': 'Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere. Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world. Not anymore. We made clear, and I’ve made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:04:13)', 'Speech': 'But I will make no apologies that we’re investing to make America stronger. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, that China intends to be dominating. Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect advanced technologies so they will not be used against us. Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression. Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world. Anyone else in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:04:45)', 'Speech': 'And I am committed. I’m committed to work with China where we can advance American interests and benefit the world. But make no mistake about it: as we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did. Look, let’s be clear: winning the competition should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world. But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker. Autocracy has grown weaker, not stronger. Name me a world leader who would change places with Xi Jinping. Name me one. Name me one.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:05:38)', 'Speech': 'America is rallying the world to meet those challenges, from climate to global health to food insecurity to terrorism to territorial aggression. Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more. Look, the bridges we’re forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic, and those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are. It’s never, ever been a good bet to bet against America. Never.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:06:06)', 'Speech': 'When I came to office, most assured the bipartisanship assumed was impossible. But I never believed it. That’s why a year ago, I offered a unity agenda to the nation as I stood here. We’ve made real progress together. We passed a law making it easy for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction. We passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health. We launched the ARPA-H drive for breakthrough in the fights against cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes, and so much more. We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named after the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:07:17)', 'Speech': 'I understand something about those burn pits. But there’s so much more to do. And we can do it together. Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire. He wrote Jill, my wife, a letter, and me as well, about his courageous daughter Courtney. Her contagious laugh, his sister’s best friend, her sister’s best friend. He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans, and many of you in the audience.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:07:47)', 'Speech': 'Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually death from a fentanyl overdose. She was just 20 years old. Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There’s no worse pain.” Yet their family has turned pain to purpose, working to end the stigma and change laws. He told us he wants to start a journey toward American recovery. Doug, we’re with you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:08:21)', 'Speech': 'Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year. You got it. Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, and the sale and trafficking, with more drug detection machines, inspection cargo, stop pills and powder at the border. Working with couriers like FedEx to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking. Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:09:08)', 'Speech': 'When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at their schools. We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting they’re doing running children for profit. And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on our kids and teenagers online. Ban targeted advertising to children and impose stricter limits on the personal data the companies collect on all of us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:09:42)', 'Speech': 'Third, let’s do more to keep this nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home. Job training, job placement for veterans and their spouses as they come to return to civilian life. Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in America, especially someone who served the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:10:19)', 'Speech': 'Denis McDonough is here of the V.A. We had our first real discussion when I asked him to take the job. I’m glad he did. We were losing up to 25 veterans a day on suicide. Now we’re losing 17 a day to the silent scourge of suicide. Seventeen veterans a day are committing suicide. More than all the people being killed in the wars. Folks, the V.A. is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings. Proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through. Get them the help they need. We’ve got to do more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:11:05)', 'Speech': 'And fourth, last year Jill and I reignited the cancer moonshot that I was able to start with President Obama, asked me to lead our administration on this issue. Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by 50% in the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families. It’s personal for so many of us, so many of us in this audience.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:11:35)', 'Speech': 'Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama. They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I got married in New York City. Kindred spirits. He wrote us a letter about his little daughter Ava, and I saw her just before I came over. She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, cancer. After 26 blood transfusions, 11 rounds of radiation, eight rounds of chemo, one kidney removed, given a 5% survival rate. He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “If she goes, I can’t stay.” Many of you have been through that as well. Jill and I understand that, like so many of you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:12:26)', 'Speech': 'And he read Jill’s book describing our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where we could with Beau. For them, that glimmer of joy was the half-smile of their baby girl. It meant everything to them. They never gave up hope. Little Ava never gave up hope. She turns 4 next month. They just found out Ava is beating the odds, is on her way to being cured of cancer, and she’s watching from the White House tonight if she’s not asleep already.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:13:04)', 'Speech': 'For the lives we can save and the lives we’ve lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can still do big things. Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, he undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against H.I.V./AIDS. It’s been a huge success. He thought big, he thought large. He moved. I believe we can do the same thing with cancer. Let’s end cancer as we know it. Cure some cancers once and for all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:13:59)', 'Speech': 'Folks, there’s one reason why we’ve been able to do all of these things: our democracy itself. It’s the most fundamental thing of all. With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is. For the last few years our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk. Put to the test in this very room on Jan. 6. And then, just a few months ago, an unhinged Big Lie assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-speaker of the House of Representatives, using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on Jan. 6.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:14:44)', 'Speech': 'Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack but is as tough and as strong and resilient as they get, my friend Paul Pelosi. Paul, stand up. But such a heinous act should have never happened. We must all speak out. There’s no place for political violence in America. We have to protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. Honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We have to uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy. And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor. Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It’s an American issue. Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called to protect our democracy, defend it, stand up for it. And this is our moment. My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the direction we now take is going to decide the course of this nation for decades to come. We’re not bystanders of history. We’re not powerless before the forces that confront us. It’s within our power, of We the People. We’re facing the test of our time. We have to be the nation we’ve always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking. A nation that embraces light over dark, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:16:43)', 'Speech': 'We have to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We’re good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea. The only one. Other nations are defined by geography, ethnicity. But we’re the only nation based on an idea: that all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:17:25)', 'Speech': 'So I have come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the State of the Union. And here is my report: because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong. I’m not new to this place. I stand here tonight having served as long as about any one of you have ever served here. But I’ve never been more optimistic about our future, about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing, beyond our capacity if we do it together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:18:26)', 'Speech': 'God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

The Kremlin was notified hours in advance, all as Russia has begun its major new offensive in the east.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:23)', 'Speech': 'Meanwhile, US officials are closely watching the relationship between China and Russia. There’s growing concern from US officials that China is considering giving Russia lethal aid that could be used in Ukraine. Let’s get right to MSNBS chief correspondent, Ali Velshi. He is live in Ukraine’s capitol of Kyiv. Ali, how have the people in the Capitol responded to President Biden’s visit?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:24)', 'Speech': 'That point you noted in the beginning, that this is the first time a president has come to a war zone in which there’s no US military presence, no active military presence on the ground. So he was at the mercy of everybody else doing the right thing, including the Russians taking that deconflicting message and not doing anything while Biden was in town. Remember, there were air raid sirens while he was here. So to see just over here, which is where the two presidents were, to see them walking down the street with air raid sirens, not missing a beat, I think sent a lot of resolve through the Ukrainian people. We spoke to a few people today who did say that. They said, “Look, it’s important to us to see Joe Biden here. To feel the resolve of the American people behind this war did mean something.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:08)', 'Speech': 'Of course, the president had the final sign-off, but it was clear that even last year in Poland when Joe Biden was there at the beginning of the war, he had wanted to go into Ukraine, and the safety situation was such that it wasn’t doable. So they spent months and months planning on a trip that was doable and it was achieved. The President now back in Poland in safety. But boy, that was a real chapter. If anybody hasn’t read the Pool Reports on how this went down, it’s worth a good read.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:32)', 'Speech': 'Remember, the other thing that Vladimir Putin does when he feels backed into a corner is he drops these references to nuclear weaponry, which we have not seen. But again, sometime tomorrow we’re going to get a speech from Vladimir Putin, which is going to be competing with a speech from Joe Biden who’s in Warsaw.

And then he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force. He found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel, president Zelensky.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:14)', 'Speech': 'President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn’t think was possible a year ago, the democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker, but the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger. Because in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, that knowing what you stand for is most important, and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference. The people of Poland know that. You know that. In fact, you know it better than anyone here in Poland, because that’s what solidarity means.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:52)', 'Speech': 'Through partition and oppression, when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw uprising during decades under the iron fist of communist rule, Poland endured because you stood together. That’s how brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracy. That’s how the resolve of Moldovan people, the resolve of the people of Moldovan to live in freedom, gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membership. President Sandu is here today. I’m not sure she is, but I’m proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving people of Moldova. Give her a round of applause.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:45)', 'Speech': 'One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition, but he still doubts our conviction. He doubts our staying power. He doubts our continued support for Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified. But there should be no doubt. Our support for Ukraine will not waiver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:16)', 'Speech': 'President Putin’s craven lust for land and power will fail and the Ukrainian people’s love for their country will prevail. Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow, and forever. For that’s what at stake here, freedom. That’s the message I carried to Kiev yesterday directly to the people of Ukraine. When President Zelensky said he came to the United States in December, quote, he said, “This struggle will define the world and our children and grandchildren, how they live, and then their children and grandchildren.” He wasn’t only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine, he was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren, yours and mine. We’re seeing it again today with the people of Poland and the people across Europe saw for decades, appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word: no, no, no,'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:32)', 'Speech': 'No, you will not take my country. No, you will not take my freedom. No, you will not take my future. And I’ll repeat tonight what I said last year in the same place. A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to ease the people’s love of liberty. Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine, Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:08)', 'Speech': 'For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. You know, this has been an extraordinary year in every sense, extraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries, they’ve committed depravities, crimes against humanity without shame or compunction. They’ve targeted civilians with death and destruction, used rape as a weapon of war. Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to steal Ukraine’s future. Bombed train stations, maternity hospital, schools and orphanages. No one, no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It’s abhorrent. It’s abhorrent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:01)', 'Speech': 'But extraordinarily as well, has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the world. One year after the bombs began to fall, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Ukraine is still independent and free. From Khersan to Kharkiv, Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land. More than 50% of the territory Russia held last year, the blue in the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again. President Zelensky still leads a democratic elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian people. And the world has already voted multiple times, including in the United Nations General Assembly, to condemn Russian’s aggression and supported a just peace. Each time in the UN, that vote has been overwhelming. In October, 143 nations in the United Nations condemn Russia’s illegal annexation. Only four, four in the entire UN, voted with Russia. Four.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:14)', 'Speech': 'So tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia. The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not plotting to attack Russia as Putin said today. And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy. This war was never a necessity. It’s a tragedy. President Putin chose this war.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:46)', 'Speech': 'Every day the war continues as his choice. He could end the war with a word. It’s simple. If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, it would be the end of Ukraine. That’s why together we’re making sure Ukraine can defend itself.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:10)', 'Speech': 'The United States has assembled worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the front lines: air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, armored vehicles. The European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine, not just in security assistance, but economic and humanitarian refugee assistance and so much more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:44)', 'Speech': 'To all of you here tonight, take a moment, and I’m serious when I say this. Turn around and look at one another. Look at what you’ve done so far. Poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you. Poland’s generosity, your willingness to open your hearts and your homes, is extraordinary. And the American people are united in our resolve as well. All across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes. Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom. That’s who Americans are and that’s what Americans do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:39)', 'Speech': 'The world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putin’s war. Putin tried to starve the world, blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain, exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hard. Instead, the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answer the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food supplies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:14)', 'Speech': 'This week, my wife, Jill Biden, is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue. Our commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine, a Ukraine that’s free, sovereign, and democratic. That was a dream of those who declared Ukraine’s independence more than 30 years ago, who led the orange revolution and the revolution of dignity, who braved ice in fire in the Maidan, and the Heavenly Hundred who died there, and those who continue still to root out Kremlin’s efforts to corrupt, coerce, and control. It’s a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who fought for years against Russia’s aggressions in the Donbas. And the heroes who’ve given everything, given their lives in the service of their beloved Ukraine.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:10)', 'Speech': 'I was honored to visit the memorial in Kiev yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives, standing alongside President Zelensky. The United States and our partners stand with Ukraine’s teachers, it’s hospital staff, it’s emergence and responders, the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russia’s cruel bombardment. We stand with the millions of refugees of this war who found a welcome in Europe and the United States, particularly here in Poland. Ordinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so. Polish businesses, civil society, cultural leaders, including the first lady of Poland who is here tonight, have led with the heart and determination, showcasing all that’s good about the human spirit. Madame First Lady, we love you. Thank you all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:14)', 'Speech': 'I’ll never forget last year visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw, seeing their faces exhausted and afraid, holding their children so close, worrying they might never see their fathers, their husbands, their brothers, their sisters again. In that darkest moment through lives, you, the people of Poland, offered them safety and light. You embraced them, you literally embraced them. I watched. I watched the looks on their faces. Meanwhile, together we made sure that Russia’s paying the price for its abuses. We continue to maintain the largest sanction regime ever imposed in any country in history, and we’re going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners. We’ll hold accountable those who are responsible for this war and we’ll seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:14)', 'Speech': 'You know, there is much for us to be proud of over the all that we have achieved together this past year. But we have to be honest and clear-eyed as we look at the year ahead. The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or the year. It’s always difficult. It’s always important. As Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counter-offensives of its own, there will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies. But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead, and the United States together with our allies and partners are going to continue to have Ukraine’s back as it defends itself.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:00)', 'Speech': 'Next year, I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States. Together, we’ll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world, NATO. And let there be no doubt the commitment of the United States to our NATO alliance and article 5 is rock solid. And every member of NATO knows it and Russia knows it as well. An attack against one is attack against all. It’s a sacred oath, a sacred oath defend every inch of NATO territory.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:48)', 'Speech': 'Over the past year, the United States has come together with our allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression. But the work in front of us is not just what we’re against, it’s about what we’re for. What kind of world do we want to build? We need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up, lifting up the lives of people everywhere, improving health, growing prosperity, preserving the plan of building peace and security, treating everyone with dignity and respect. That’s our responsibility. The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:30)', 'Speech': 'As we gather tonight, the world in my view is at an inflection point. The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come. That’s true for Americans, that’s true for the people of the world. And while decisions are ours to make now, the principles and the stakes are eternal. The choice between chaos and stability, between building and destroying, between hope and fear, between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it, between nothing less than limitation and possibilities, the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity, but in freedom, freedom, freedom. There is no sweeter word than freedom. There is no noble or goal than freedom. There’s no higher aspiration than freedom. Americans know that and you know it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:38)', 'Speech': 'And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as well, freedom. The enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the age is freedom. Stand with us. We will stand with you. Let us move forward with faith and conviction, and with an abiding commitment to be allies, not of darkness, but of light, not of oppression, but of liberation, not of captivity, but yes, of freedom. May God bless you all, may God protect our troops, and may God bless the heroes of Ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:23)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Poland. Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing. God bless you all.'}]"

This is our 58th anniversary of ‘Bloody Sunday.’ It is even more special to me this year that you are all gathered here because of the storms that ravished my city, my hometown of Selma and our state on January 12th. As I look out towards downtown Selma now that the dust has settled, I cannot help but evoke the words of our beloved John Lewis when he told us that nothing can stop the power of a committed and determined people to make a difference in our society.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:44)', 'Speech': ""Selma has made a difference in our society. It was here in Selma, Alabama that ordinary people dared to make sure that this nation lived up to its highest ideals of justice and democracy. It was here in Selma that they marched unafraid up to the apex of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and looked down and saw those state troopers. I remember asking John what would he think. And he said, “I looked over and saw the water and said, ‘I don’t know how to swim.'” But God had John and God has us. We in Selma are used to people coming and walking across the bridge. They just keep walking across the bridge and not staying here in Selma. I want you to know, as a Selman, we will always welcome the world to Selma. We’re custodians of America’s history, and we’re very glad, Mr. President, that the National Park Service is right across the street, vested in making sure that the story of Selma stays alive. Thank you.""}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:03)', 'Speech': 'But I want you to know that during this time of crisis, we need your help. My colleagues come and they ask me what kind of help. We need everything in Selma, Alabama. We need everything in Selma, Alabama. We are committed to not only rebuild better and fairer, but to rebuild and reimagine what Selma can and should be. We can only do that with help. And the good news is that the Biden administration through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, is providing us with help. The good news is that through the Inflation Reduction Act, this administration is providing us with help. The good news is that the American Rescue Plan gave cities and towns and states money directly. For the first time, Dallas County got its own money; for the first time, the city of Selma got its own money. But what we have to do is leverage these opportunities to make a difference for all of Selma. We cannot have an uneven recovery. It’s not fair and it’s not right. And Mr. President, I know you know that because you have made equity the cornerstone of your cabinet and your administration.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:24)', 'Speech': 'So I stand here to say, as we remember and reflect on the past, let us all feel renewed to rededicate ourselves and to double-down on the vision that John Lewis had of a beloved community. The last time John was here, if you close your eyes, you can hear what he said. He said, “Never give up, never give in, keep the faith and keep our eyes on the prize.” I’m so excited that this President is here to tell us that he is doubling down on the Voting Rights Advancement Act, and making sure that we fully restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I’m glad that this president is here to see us, to hear us, and to fill us. And in so doing, I know that we will get to the place we need to be, which is a better Selma and in a better Selma, a better America, and a better world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:37)', 'Speech': 'I have the awesome task of introducing the person who will introduce the president. He is none other than a foot soldier, Charles Maulden. Charles was 16 years old, a student at RB Hudson High School when he had the audacity along with those other soldiers to march across that bridge. And he just didn’t do it on Bloody Sunday. He did it on Turnaround Tuesday, and he did it again on the final march. The courage that he must have had at 17 years old to do such a thing, to be a leader in the student movement and to now stand here today in his hometown of Selma, Alabama to welcome the President of the United States. A real foot soldier, an authentic foot soldier, Charles Maulden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:40)', 'Speech': 'What I learned where there’s common determination, there’s common power. And what happened in Selma is that people took the initiative to take control of their lives despite the trepidation, despite the fear, despite the possibility of loss. We became heroes, we lost our fear. Jimmie Lee Jackson did that in Marion. Bernard Lafayette, would you stand, Bernard?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:14)', 'Speech': 'Now you’re talking about a foot soldier who’s a hero. I’ve known Bernard for 60 years, I’m sorry, Bernard. And there’s no person I admire most. And there is no person that I’ve been more influenced than Dr. Reverend Bernard Lafayette. When he came to Selma, the story was that Selma was the black folk were too scared and the white folks were too mean to get anything done. Despite that, he showed up anyway and he helped to change of city. I’m not going to go through the litany I went through Bloody Sunday and Turnaround Tuesday and the March of Montgomery, and those are exciting things to talk'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:55)', 'Speech': 'Joe Smitherman, I can’t ignore him. Richard Smiley, he’s out there somewhere. These were people who were braver than me, and everybody turned into being a leader. And so, although I was in the front of the line, I don’t claim to have led anybody anywhere because the whole line was going forward. The whole American city Black folks were going forward. What happens in a movement that if you are on the right cue, then everybody will follow you. I didn’t have to lead anybody anywhere. People like Joe Smitherman lead. I could go through names but I’m not going to do that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:40)', 'Speech': 'I’ll just simply sit the end by saying, Mr. President, welcome to Selma. I don’t want to tell all the great things you’ve already done, but I’m very aware of those and I know you’ll do greater things. And what I’d like to do is I’d like to hear more, and I’m quite sure our Congresswoman’s going to tell us about that, what the president is going to do, hopefully in some type of package, like a economic package to help bring Selma back to its old days. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:07)', 'Speech': 'Folks, look, there’s a lot to say. I’m going to try not to say very much in terms of length of time, but I want to say a few things. It was mentioned that we should be working for the people of Africa. For years I was chairman of the Africa Fair Subcommittee of the United States Senate and we’ve invested… My wife just got back from Zambia and Namibia. She’s there all the time. We just made sure we have billions of dollars committed to build Africa. Angola is going to have the largest solar facility in all of Africa. We’re investing in Africa because Africa is important and because everything happening there will affect us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:44)', 'Speech': 'So folks, that’s number one. Number two, I want to make sure that I’ve told the mayor, I think mayor’s being the toughest job in America, but one of the mayors who took some time to come and help me put together my program, Keisha Lance Bottoms. Keisha, would you stand up. From Atlanta.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:07)', 'Speech': 'She’s understandably going home because she’s got some kids and it’s about time. She promised she’d stay as long as she did and she did. But we’ve got another mayor coming too. So anyway, thank you very much, Keisha.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:19)', 'Speech': 'Folks, last time I was here, my daughter’s a social worker, Ashley Biden, was with me. She couldn’t be with me today. She wanted to because she’s working on a project for battered women up in Delaware and Philadelphia. So she sends her best.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:35)', 'Speech': 'On this stage, the children of God started a journey, walking, not saying a word, beaten, teargassed. On this bridge, blood was given to help redeem the soul of America. Last time he was here, I was with him, John Lewis. They were his words. Mayor Perkins, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, members of Congress, all of you are here, Charles Mauldin, all the foot soldiers of Selma, distinguished guest. They were among the final words of our dear friend, John Lewis, delivered as he stood on the bridge over troubled waters three years ago. I had the privilege of standing with him. Words that give meaning to the past and purpose to the future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:27)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been on this bridge before as vice president, as a candidate for president, and was even before as a senator because history matters. And now I’m here as your president. The truth matters, notwithstanding with the other team is trying to hide. They’re trying to hide the truth. No matter how hard some people try, we can’t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. We should learn everything, the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. And everyone should know the truth of Selma. 600 believers put faith in the action to march across that bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the KKK. They were on their way to the state capital of Montgomery to claim their fundamental right to vote, laid in the bedrock of our constitution, but stolen by hate, harbored in too many hearts. With unflinching courage, foot soldiers for march for justice marched through the valley of the shadow of death and they feared no evil. The forces of hate conspired to demise, but they endured. They forced the country to confront the hard truth and to act, to keep the promise of America alive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:56)', 'Speech': 'I was a student up north in the civil rights movement. I remember feeling how guilty I was I wasn’t here. How could we all be up there and you going through what you went through? Looking at those I can still picture the troopers with their batons and wands and whips. A promise that declares we are all created and deserve to be treated equally. Two weeks later, they marched to Montgomery with Dr. King, an even bigger coalition of people from different races and faith. Five months later, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. Five months later.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:38)', 'Speech': 'But as I come here in commemoration, not for show, Selma is a reckoning. The right to vote, to have your vote counted is the threshold of democracy and liberty. With it, anything’s possible. Without that right, nothing is possible. And this fundamental right remains under assault. The conservative Supreme Court has gutted at the Voting Rights Act over the years. Since the 2020 election, a wave of states and dozens of anti-voting laws, fueled by the big lie and the election deniers now elected to office.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:26)', 'Speech': 'The new law here in Alabama, among other things, enacted a new congressional map that discriminated against Black voters by failing to include what should have been a new predominantly Black district. That case, as you all know better than I, is in front of the US Supreme Court, and my US Department of Justice has joined many of you in arguing that the map violates the Voting Rights Act. All of this, after a deadly insurrection'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:05)', 'Speech': 'In January, I signed the Electoral Count Reform Act to protect the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power. But we know that we must get the votes in Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:27)', 'Speech': 'I’ve made it clear. I will not let a filibuster obstruct the sacred right to vote and the right of any other right that flow from there. And that’s why we followed the words that you all have, the words of Dr. King. He said, “Give us the ballot. We will place judges on the bench who will do justly.” Led by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and more Black women appointed to the federal appellate court than every other President in history has done, we’re about to do that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:06)', 'Speech': 'After Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act last year, I did what was in my power. I signed an executive order requiring all the key elements of the bill applied to federal law enforcement I couldn’t make at the states: banning chokeholds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, establishing a database for police misconduct, advancing effective and accountable community policing that builds public trust. And we’ll keep fighting to pass the reform nationwide.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:40)', 'Speech': 'Folks, well, we passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years, but I’m not ready to stop, nor is Jim Clyburn or anybody else up there ready to stop.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:52)', 'Speech': 'I led the effort when I was a senator to pass the assault weapons ban. And we’re going to ban assault weapons again. They matter. When we had the ban, fewer people died, fewer mass shootings. And together, we’re saying loud and clearly that, in America, hate and extremism will not prevail, although they are rearing their ugly head with significance now. Silence, as the saying goes: Silence is complicity. And I promise you, my administration will not remain silent. I promise you. The task before us is about justice, but it’s also about jobs, financial stability, the ability to generate generational wealth. It’s about hope, self-worth. It’s about dignity. And that’s why we’re building an economy, that I’ve been significantly criticized for, but I make no apologies, that grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. We weren’t poor, but we weren’t wealthy. We were a typical middle-class family with a three-bedroom home and four kids and a grandpop living with us. I don’t remember anything trickling down on my dad’s kitchen table with the trickle-down economic problems. Because when we do that, we build from the middle out and the bottom up, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does very well, and the wealthy still do well. We all do well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:26)', 'Speech': 'But we know there’s work to do, especially as you recover from this devastating tornado and the storms that hit in January. That’s why, working with Terri and the Mayor, I issued a Major Disaster Declaration immediately, committing the federal government to cover 100% of the debris removal. We also are paying for temporary housing and home repairs, supporting local businesses, small businesses, as well as doing in other towns devastated as you have been. To date, we’ve provided $8 million in recovery, and we’re just getting started the rebuilding effort. And we’re here, we’ll be here as long as it takes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:08)', 'Speech': 'The first major bill we passed without a single vote from the other team was the American Rescue Plan, when I was sworn in. That has provided $60 million to Selma and Dallas County directly. One of the things, having been a county official for two years, I learned a long time ago: I didn’t like anything that went through the state legislature. Oh, I’m not joking. Good people, but they all want a piece of it. If it was supposed to come to my county, it better damn well come to my county directly. So this is going directly to your county, directly to your city, to keep teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters on the job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:46)', 'Speech': 'Selma is also benefiting from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is a multi-multi-billion-dollar commitment to rebuild this country. How can we be the leading economy in the world if we don’t have the best roads, ports, and so on? How can we be that? Well, guess what? It’s the largest investment in infrastructure since Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:09)', 'Speech': 'Here in Selma, we’re funding major water projects, removing over 800 poisonous lead-pipe service lines that are over 100 years old, because every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water without fear of getting sick.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:27)', 'Speech': 'And it’s also going to deliver affordable high-speed Internet to every single home in this county and this city. So no parent, God forbid another pandemic, is going to have to sit in the McDonald’s parking lot to use their Internet to be able to have their kid’s homework be done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:46)', 'Speech': 'Look, and in the process, these kinds of investments are going to create good-paying jobs. Most of these jobs don’t require college degrees. They’ll be able to hire here, hire in your community. And, by the way, the unemployment rate for African Americans under my administration is the second lowest it’s ever been in all of American history, and we’re going to continue to make sure that happens.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:12)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, I’m the only President, I’ve learned, that had permanent offices in the White House for the Divine Nine and the HBCUs. I figured it out, man. I figured it out. Now, I know that the Vice President thinks that Howard is the best. Delaware State University, where I come from. But all kidding aside, we’ve contributed billions of dollars to put HBCUs in a position, because they don’t have, I mean it seriously, billions of dollars, because they don’t have the kind of trust funds that the major schools have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:58)', 'Speech': 'So, guess what? It leaves out an awful lot of qualified African Americans at HBCUs from learning how to deal with cybersecurity, learning how to deal with all the stuff in the future. Guess what? Right now, now they have that. And I’m able, as the President of the United States, to award these contracts directly there, because they have a lab. I’m serious. It’s a big deal. There’s a lot more we’re doing for Selma and cities like it all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:27)', 'Speech': 'When I passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which, again, the other team didn’t participate at all, which allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time. Do you realize, in America, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world? You hear me? More. And I’ve been fighting this for the last 25 years. But guess what? We finally beat Big Pharma.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:53)', 'Speech': 'So, now, oh, man, you have no idea how good I felt about that one. Because what’s happened? What happened is, now Medicare can say, “We are not going to pay you more than $35,” instead of $400, “for that insulin that you need.” And guess what that means? Not only, not only it reduced prices for people who need help, but it reduces the federal budget by $158 billion. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:28)', 'Speech': 'In addition to that, when we reduced the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare, we got a commitment. Initially, I proposed that we reduce it for anybody needing that insulin. Well, guess what? The other team voted that down too. But along came, along came the largest maker of insulin in the country. They, as they said, seen the Lord. They saw a light. And here’s the deal, I’m not kidding: Eli Lilly, one of the biggest drug makers of insulin, they just announced'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:39)', 'Speech': 'But there’s more work to do. We’ll protect social security and Medicare and we’ll protect … By the way, did you see that State of the Union address?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:23)', 'Speech': 'We used to have about 670 billionaires in America. Now we have about a thousand. Do you realize they pay a lower tax rate than your police officers or the people driving that ambulance? They pay a lower tax rate than hardworking folks. I think you should be able to make a trillion dollars. Just pay your fair share, Jack. No, I mean it. And, by the way, we’ll also cut the deficit when we have them begin to pay their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:58)', 'Speech': 'Look, with Terry’s leadership, let’s make sure working parents in Selma and across the country have a living wage. There should be sick days available, paid family and medical leave. We’re the only country in the world that doesn’t have it. Affordable childcare and elder care. It saves money. Let’s restore the full child tax credit. And, by the way, that cut Black child poverty in half and gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room, including almost a million folks in Alabama.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:39)', 'Speech': 'I was telling the mayor on the way over. My dad’s a hardworking guy, a real gentleman, a decent man. He never got a college degree. He never got to go to college. It was a great regret he had, but you know what he used to say? For real, I’m sorry I always quote my dad, but it’s worth saying. He’d say, “Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your decency. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.’ It’s so easy to make that happen without any fundamental changes, but they’re not letting us, up to now.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:19)', 'Speech': 'With HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. Marcia, you’re here, right? There you are. She’s my Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs. Look, she’s leading the way on housing discrimination and affordable quality housing. My message to you is this. We see you. We’re fighting to make sure no one’s left behind. This is the time of choosing and we need everybody engaged. We know history does not look kindly on those who deny the march across the bridge to redeem the soul of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:51)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. In many of your faith traditions, Sunday is the Sabbath, the day of rest, but on that Sunday morning on March 7th, 1965, Amelia Boynton Robinson and 600 of her fellow children of God chose different pews. On this bridge of her beloved Selma, they were called to the altar of democracy. Unsure of their fate, but certain that the cause was righteous. So she would go on to say, quote, “You can never know where you’re going unless you know where you’ve been.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:31)', 'Speech': 'We know where we have been. My fellow Americans, on this Sunday of our time, we know where we’ve been and we know more importantly where we have to go: forward together. So let’s pray, but let’s not rest. Let’s keep marching. Let’s keep the faith. But most of all, let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. So let’s go and finish the job. God bless you all and may God bless our troops.'}]"

We wanted a better life and better opportunities and I found those opportunities as a part of the labor movement. I graduated from high school in 2015 and by the age of 19 I started working non-union construction. I then joined the IUPAT in 2020 and it changed my life for the better. Being part of the union provides me and my coworkers with a level of safety, security, consistent work hours, and opportunity to learn from more experienced members and support on the job. Because of my union membership, I am the first member of my family to own a home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:35)', 'Speech': 'One of the things that I’m most looking forward to is helping new apprentices following my footsteps. I want to mentor my brothers and sisters who will get to join my union because of the policies of President Biden and his administration. I am so proud to stand before you today. I never imagined I would get an opportunity like this to share my story and what being a part of the labor movement means to me. So brothers, sisters, and siblings, it is my honor to introduce the President of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:38)', 'Speech': 'Now before I get going, hey everybody, how are you? Mom’s demand action and we’re going to get action. Hey, you know what? His mom’s watching, Tina. Tina, I wish you were here. I could meet you. But they say they speak in a little bit of an accent in Southern Delaware. Talk at you like this. You know what I mean? You look at that fellow, you say you’ve done good with that boy. Congratulations, mom. Congratulations. Thank you, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:09)', 'Speech': 'Please have a seat. Well, I don’t know whether you know this or not because of the previous president, Jimmy Wilson. Jimmy Wilson, the only reason I’m standing here is you guys, not a joke. And when I was running with Barack, we were having things were slowing up a little bit and I asked for help and you guys got in a bus and got a bus and you’re the reason why I’m standing here. I was vice president then and I’m president because of you guys. And again, they say, I’ve told your son he got good blood. My dad would say. But thank you all very, very much and it’s great to be here with Josh Shapiro. I predict he is going to be one of the best governors in the history of the state. Where are you?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:12)', 'Speech': 'That’s in large part because he married up. And I want to thank Congressman Brendan Boyle for the passport to get into his district. Brendan, you’ve been a great friend from the time we’ve been together. Thank you, thank you, thank you. By the way, he now leads the democratic part of the budget committee. He’s the guy that is going to determine whether or not my budget is passed. But while they couldn’t be here, I want to thank Jim Kenny, who’s a good friend, mayor of Philadelphia, and two great senators, great close, close friend, Bobby Casey and John Fetterman who will continue to deliver for the people of Pennsylvania, I believe. John, if you can hear this at all, we’re with you, pal. We’re with you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:12)', 'Speech': 'Everybody asked why I ever moved from Scranton. Moved from Scranton because we lived five blocks from the Casey’s. You think I’m kidding now? I knew as long as his dad was around, I’d never be able to be a senator or governor of Pennsylvania. And then along comes Bobby. Anyway, great, great family and great friends. Folks, here’s why I’m here today for too long working people have been breaking their necks, but the economy’s left them behind, working people like you while those at the top get away with everything and get everything. One of the reasons why I ran for president, and I mean this sincerely, you may remember when I announced, I said there are three reasons I was running. Wanted to restore the soul of America. There’s also decency and honor to the system. And two, to rebuild the backbone of the country. The middle class, when the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:08)', 'Speech': 'And the third one is to unite the country. Didn’t think we could do that, but as we’ve seen all the talk about we never get any cooperation from the other team. The last two years we passed some pretty big things with bipartisan support. I ran to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up and not the top down. And I know when I grew up my dad’s kitchen table, not a whole lot trickle down on trickle down economics into my kitchen table for my dad. That’s where I wanted to come here today to lay out the next part of my economic plan, my budget, my budget I’m sending to Congress today. And if I could hold for just a second, I want to be clear and I’ll be clear to the press as well. The fact is that the Speaker of the House has been… He’s a very conservative guy and he has even more conservative group with him.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:55)', 'Speech': 'But he and I met early on and he said, “What are we going to do about the budget?” And I said, “Well, let’s make a deal. Let’s meet.” And I said, “I’m going to introduce my budget on the 9th of March. You introduce yours and we’ll sit down and we’ll go line by line and we’ll go through it. We’ll see what we can agree on, what we disagree on, and then fight it out in the Congress.” So I want to make it clear, I’m ready to meet with the Speaker anytime tomorrow if he has his budget. Lay it down. Tell me what you want to do. I’ll show you what I want to do. See what we can agree on it. We don’t agree on it. Let’s see what we vote on. Now, I’m not going to lay out the entire budget. That would take the rest of the day, but no, it’s a detailed budget. But I want to give you the contours of what we’re for and how it’s in stark contrast for what appears to be what the other team is for. My dad had an expression. Someone come up to my dad and say, let me tell you what I valued, Joe. And they say, my dad would say, no, no. Show me your budget. I’ll tell you what you value. No, I’m serious. My expression my dad would do is show me your budget. I will tell you what you value. Well folks, let me tell you what I value with the budget I’m releasing today. I value everyone having an even shot. Not just labor, but small business owners, farmers, and so many other people hold the country together who’ve been basically invisible for a long time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:29)', 'Speech': 'So the end of the month after working like the devil, they just have a little bit more breathing room with my dad would say. After you pay all your bills, you’re sitting at that kitchen table, writing out the last bill. Do you have just a little bit of breathing room left? So my budget reflects what we can do to lift the burden on hard work on Americans. And there’s more than one way to do that. And that’s going bring us to down to everyday cost. How much do things cost? It’s not just inflation, we brought down inflation seven months in a row. We’re going to whip it. But in the meantime, there’s other ways to take. What is inflation in your budget? I just met, I won’t embarrass them by pointing out, I don’t have permission, but I just met a woman who has healthcare costs that are $600,000 a year, $7,000 a month.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:19)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? How can you possibly deal with that? Well, we just dealt with it, by the way. We just dealt with it. For example, prescription drugs. We pay more for prescription drugs in America than any other advanced nation on Earth. Say that again. In the United States, America, for whatever prescriptions drug you’re buying, you’re paying more than any other nation on earth as an advanced nation. We’re finally beginning to change that. I’ve been fighting that for over 30 years. Because of the law that I worked on and for decades and that I just signed last year, we took big pharma on and we won. For the first time we won.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:58)', 'Speech': 'The other team didn’t think that’s a good idea. None of them voted for it. They think big pharma should be able to make extraordinary profits, exorbitant profits. It’s the expensive American people. And that’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. Medicare finally has the power now to negotiate for lower drug prices. And by the way, they’ve been able to do that at the VA. At the VA, they’re able to say, we’re only going to pay X amount of dollars for this particular drug that in fact the veterans need. The only price was exempt was Medicare. They couldn’t do it for Medicare, but now they can.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:43)', 'Speech': 'And it’s going to lower prices for seniors. But here’s the deal, not only, for example, the woman I just mentioned by the beginning of 2025, she’ll not have to pay more than $2,000 a year total amount for drugs. Folks, it’s not just going to save people’s lives and save people money so they don’t have to go bankrupt to try to stay alive. It’s going to save the government. It’s going to reduce the deficit $160 billion. These guys keep saying how you going to cut the deficit? Well, guess what? If your tax dollars don’t have to go up paying all that exorbitant price for Medicare to drug companies and it’s rational, it’s going to save $160 billion in tax dollars.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:44)', 'Speech': 'Millions of Americans have diabetes. They need insulin literally to stay alive. How many people know somebody who needs insulins for their diabetes? Raise your hand. Well, they’re paying somewhere between four and $700 a month now, or were until last month. Well, guess what? That insulin was invented 100 years ago. I mean, yeah, literally 100 years ago. Do you know much it costs to make that insulin? $10. Do you how much it costs to make it and package it? $13 and 50 cents and charging the kind of money they charge. Well, guess what? Now, we’ve lowered the cost of the insulin to maximum $35 a month.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:48)', 'Speech': 'I was at a town meeting in Northern Virginia last year and a woman stood up and she was a little embarrassed to speak. She said, “I have two daughters with diabetes and I can’t afford the insulin.” And she talked like that. And she said, “And we have to split it sometimes.” Can you imagine looking at your son or daughter and knowing you don’t have the money to pay for the insulin to keep them alive and healthy? Not a joke. Talk about being deprived of your dignity. Well, not any more. Seniors on Medicare don’t have to pay more than $35 bucks a month. And guess what? I thought we should cut it for everybody to $35 bucks a month. But my friends and other team knocked it out. I didn’t have the votes. I lost by a couple votes. Well, guess what? Capping the cost for everybody at $35 a month, especially those 200,000 children with type one diabetes. Well, here’s what happened. Eli Lilly,'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:19)', 'Speech': 'So folks, it’s going to save a lot of lives, but also it’s going to give parents back the dignity they’ve been deprived because they can’t take care of their kid for something that’s so basic and so important.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:34)', 'Speech': 'But again, the MAGA Republicans want to take away the law. One of the things they’ve announced they want to do away with the Inflation Reduction Act. Okay, well, we have a difference in budget ideas, man. More than budget ideas, but anyway.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:47)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, how many people, maybe even some of you, you know people who stared at the ceiling last night wondering, “God forbid if I get pancreatic cancer, my wife gets breast cancer, something happened, what’s going to happen? How we going to pay the bills?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:04)', 'Speech': 'I can tell the story of… My dad would probably be mad my telling it were he alive. We lived in a three bedroom split-level home. I mean, it was a nice home. We were a middle class family with four kids and a grandpop, and the bed, my headboard was against in the room with myself and my two brothers was against the wall of my dad’s, my dad was really restless. You could hear it one night. You could hear the bed and I asked my mom the next morning, “What’s wrong with Dad?” She said, “His company said no more health insurance. They weren’t going to pay for it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:38)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? A lot of people are lying in bed at night wondering what they’re going to do. They’re going to have to sell the house? What do they have to do if one of them gets really sick?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:48)', 'Speech': 'Well, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which not one single Republican voted for that I signed into law as soon as they got to office, millions of Americans or millions more have enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, saving additional $800 a year for better coverage at better prices.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:09)', 'Speech': 'My budget’s going to make those savings permanent. We’ve passed them up till now, but they’ll expire if I don’t get them done again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:17)', 'Speech': 'My MAGA Republicans all voted to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. They voted to get rid of it over 50 times since Barack passed it, over 50 times.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:59)', 'Speech': 'Look what’s happening. The Colorado River has become a creek. You have all these environmental problems that are so profound they’re hard to deny. And people are seeing them now, along with extreme superstorms and droughts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:15)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I took the most aggressive action ever in all of history in any country to take on the climate crisis by lowering your home energy bills, which MAGA Republicans voted against. We’ve now gotten to a point where it’s cheaper to generate electricity from wind and solar than it is from coal and/or fossil fuels. And I’m from Scranton, okay, I’m not against coal per se. A lot of people made a living on that way, but we’re providing incentives for folks to make the transition.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:50)', 'Speech': 'So here’s what we’re doing. We’re providing you with a tax credit, tax credit and rebates if you’re buying new efficient, energy-efficient appliances, heat pumps, the new heat pumps. They can heat the whole damn house. No, I’m serious. Not a joke. Well, if you need a heater and you need to buy one of those heat pump, you get a tax credit for doing it and water heaters, tax credits to weatherize your homes with better windows and doors.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:19)', 'Speech': 'I gathered together leaders from American autoworkers in the South Lawn of the White House, all American manufacturers, and it is two years, a year and a half, well, two summers ago, and guess what? They all agreed within the next month, they came to me and said, “We’re going to go all electric. We’re going to go all electric,” and that’s going to save billions of gallons of gasoline burning into the air. It’s not only going to save the environment, it’s going to help create really good paying jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:51)', 'Speech': 'We’re providing tax credits for folks who buy electric vehicles to encourage them to do it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:57)', 'Speech': 'We’re still going to need combustion engines. We’re going to still need oil for the next 10 to 15 years because all of a sudden, they’re not all going to go away. But all this is going to lower energy costs for families on an average of a thousand dollars a year and create good-paying union jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:19)', 'Speech': 'Jimmy, I told you I was going to be the most pro-union president in history. I’ve kept my promise, I’ve kept my promise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:26)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, when we’re talking about the creating jobs, my buddies at the IBEW were the strongest support I had this year. Well, guess what? They’re going to install 500,000 charging stations all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:52)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, the things that I’m proposing not only lift the burden off of families in America, it’s all going to generate economic growth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:59)', 'Speech': 'And that’s not all. To support working parents my budget expands access to affordable childcare for millions of families, and it’s going to invest in paid family and medical leave, which all of you fought like hell for so that the US is no longer the only major economy in the world that doesn’t have paid leave.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:22)', 'Speech': 'Folks, my budget also invests in the elder care and home care. How many of you are like I went through with my mom and my dad as they got older? They wanted to stay in their own home. It was cheaper to stay in their own home than to have to sell everything and have everything on to go into a home. Well, fortunately, I lived close enough and they could move in with me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:45)', 'Speech': 'But my point is, it’s cheaper if we provide for the ability for them to stay in their homes. It’s not only right thing to do, but it’s cheaper on the taxpayer. All the things are going to help folks go to work, generate economic growth in our nation and still take care of their families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:07)', 'Speech': 'The point is that when every time I talk about things, people talk about it like this is an overwhelming burden on the taxpayer. It’s going to save money for the taxpayers. No, it really does save money for the taxpayers and generate growth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:22)', 'Speech': 'That’s how the economy grows. That’s why I was able to create 12 million new jobs in two years, more than any president in American history has created in four years. We’ve done in two years what no president has done in four years because of you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:43)', 'Speech': 'But the point is, it’s good for everybody. We’re not hurting anyone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:48)', 'Speech': 'My budget also restores the Child Tax Credit. When that was in place during the pandemic, guess what? Child poverty was cut in half to the lowest level in all American history, and guess what? Because moms are able to go to work. Moms are able to go out there and make a living.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:06)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we can reduce child poverty and increase child opportunity. Again, it’s going to help millions of parents go to work, knowing that children are being taken care of and yet only a few of my Republican friends support it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:20)', 'Speech': 'My wife, Jill, who’s a Philly girl, if I didn’t root like hell for every Philadelphia team, I’d be sleeping alone. Well, you think I’m kidding? Jimmy knows my… Oh, whoa.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:37)', 'Speech': 'Anyway. She’s in class today teaching and she has an expression she uses for real. He said, “Any country that out-educates us will out-compete us.” Let me say it again. “Any country that out educates us will out-compete us.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:53)', 'Speech': 'For decades, we were not only… We were the only country in the world. We led the world economically. We were the only economy in the world that was moving that fast because we had the best educated public in the world. We started before any other country… Higher education was more sophisticated and a lot of private institutions. Everybody in America at the turn of the 20th century said that we could go to school for free for 12 years was a game-changer. It was a-game changer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:25)', 'Speech': 'But the rest of the world has caught up. We all know 12 years is not enough to succeed in the second quarter of the 21st century. Seriously, 12 years is not enough. If we want America to have the best educated workforce, we need to invest in preschool. I’m not talking about daycare, I’m talking about school.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:49)', 'Speech': 'All the studies have recently shown, this is real, think about it now, that you’ve heard all these story that if you come from a broken home, or where Mom or Dad has a drug addiction or there’s a real problem, or you don’t have books in the house, et cetera, by the time a kid gets to first grade, they will have heard a million fewer words spoken. Not different words, just spoken. They’re not included.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:16)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? Studies of children that go to preschool who go three, four, five, six years, or three, four, five years old go to school, not daycare, they increase by nearly 50% the likelihood that they’ll finish high school and go on to earn a two or four-year degree no matter what their background is, because guess what? Their brain’s still developing. They’re still developing. They’re exposed to the same thing other kids are exposed to, they grow.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:46)', 'Speech': 'We also know that many families struggle to afford college for their children. That’s why we had these things called, and some of you may have used them, Pell Grants. For families earning less than $60,000 a year, they could get a Pell Grant to go to college, help them pay for college. Well, the last two years, we’ve increased Pell Grants by $900 and my budget increases by another $820.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:07)', 'Speech': 'It used to be if you went to the University of Pennsylvania, or I mean, Penn State or the University of Delaware where I went, state schools, the state paid a significant portion of tuition. They’re not anymore. They’re not paying anymore. They’re paying some, but not much because they’ve cut paying for it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:25)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? Try paying for college, even at a state institution where you can commute. It’s expensive as hell, especially if you’re a couple kids in the family making less than 60 grand a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:37)', 'Speech': 'So it matters a lot. It matters a lot. The more we educate people, the better chance they have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:43)', 'Speech': 'Doesn’t mean everybody who is educated is going to succeed, but it’s significantly better opportunity. And the world’s getting a hell of a lot more complicated. Getting a hell of a lot more complicated. So I’ve increased my budget. We increase it now, as I said, we’re paying another $820 to help with people from families with low incomes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:06)', 'Speech': 'Let’s connect students’ careers and opportunities starting in high school. We should provide for two years of community college.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:12)', 'Speech': 'By the way, in school, when you’re a sophomore, junior in high school, you should be able to take credits that allow you to qualify for college credit at a state university or at a community college. People are beginning to do that around the country. Some of the best training in America has occurs there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:31)', 'Speech': 'Let’s offer every American a path to a good career, whether they go to college or not, like the path you started here, the first apprenticeship program in the nation in which students can graduate as a full-time journeyman with an associate’s degree here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:45)', 'Speech': 'In the past two years, we’ve created, as I said, 12 million jobs, more than two years than any president has done in four years. I don’t have to tell the union workers here that includes 800,000 manufacturing jobs in two years. Two years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:14)', 'Speech': 'We’ve also seen more people apply to start small businesses than ever before. Not just unions. It’s small businesses. More people. What’s someone making an application to start a small business? It’s about hope. It’s about hope. In the last several decades, corporate America spent… Things began to change. I come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware. Literally, more corporations are incorporated in the state of Delaware than every other state in the United States combined.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:47)', 'Speech': 'It used to be when I was in high school, when I first got started, those corporations had some greater social responsibility. They paid higher taxes. They actually saw to it that people… They'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:29)', 'Speech': 'But the world caught up. You know where we rank in terms of quality infrastructure in the world? Number 13. 13. That’s why I signed, this was bipartisan, Republicans joined us, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the most significant instrument and investment to modernize our infrastructure in nearly 70 years, since the Eisenhower… We and you, we’re going to spend $1.2 trillion over 10 years to rebuild the infrastructure in this country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:08)', 'Speech': 'How can you lead the world if you have second-rate ports, highways, drinking water, et cetera? Instead of Infrastructure Week, which became a punchline with the last guy. Remember, every year, there’s going to be infrastructure week? We got infrastructure decade. A modern infrastructure will not only make us more economically competitive, it’s going to create more benefits, save money for the country and families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:38)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to replace every lead pipe in the United States of America so children can drink water, 400,000 schools, 6 million. We’re going to make sure that they’re not drinking poison. For real. Every American. It’s going to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We’re delivering high-speed Internet to every home in America so no parent has to drive up to the McDonald’s parking lot to help do the homework with their kid because they can’t get onto an Internet. Every single person is going to be able to do that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:17)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal. I’ve been criticized for this next piece. I’ve probably been criticized for a lot before that, too. But for this next piece, the deal is, when we do these projects, we’re going to buy American. Here’s the deal. Back in 1932, we passed a law that’s consistent with international trade, that when you give a President money, when they pass legislation and say, “Mr. President, go build a new aircraft carrier deck,” they said you should buy American. You should use American products and American workers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:56)', 'Speech': 'No one paid lot of attention to that. They said, “Well, if it’s 40%, it’s okay,” and so on. Guess what? I made sure it’s a minimum of 60%, and we’re going for 100% and we’re creating a whole hell of a lot of jobs. It’s not to hurt any other country. It’s not. But think about it. I wonder how many people talked about “the supply chain” before the pandemic. Everybody knows what a supply chain is now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:35)', 'Speech': 'Guess what? The reason why we stopped making cars for a while, they became so expensive, we lost the supply chains for computer chips, because we didn’t make them. We invented in it America. We miniaturized them. We made them better, and guess what? They went all overseas, in Southeast Asia, other places. When the pandemic hit them and they had to close down, we had no access to computer chips. You can’t make an American automobile without those chips. You can’t make a refrigerator without those. You can’t make a cell phone without those chips, and so on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:15)', 'Speech': 'I’ve spoken with my European friends, the heads of state, to make clear to them, we’re not trying to deny them anything. But here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to be at the beginning of the supply chain, not the end of the supply chain. Folks, so all the construction materials used in federal infrastructure project can be made in America: lumber, gas, drywall, glass, fiber optic cables, and on my watch, American roads, bridges, highways, they’re going to be made with American products.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:50)', 'Speech': 'In addition to that, we need to get back to leading the world in inventing and innovation. We used to spend 2% of our entire gross domestic product on innovation and science. We now do 0.7%. What I proposed was a thing called the CHIPS and Science Act to make sure America leads the world in innovation, especially in manufacturing those semiconductors. These are those small computer chips the size of the tip of my little finger that power everyday lives: cellphones, automobiles, refrigerators, artificial intelligence, so on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:32)', 'Speech': 'America invented these chips. We made them faster, smaller, and more powerful. We used to provide 40% of them to the world. Now, today, we’re down to 10%. Today’s automobiles need 3,000 of those chips, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips available to them. That’s why, remember, the price of cars skyrocketed and they shut down assembly lines. We did everything from refrigerators to cellphones. We can never let that happen again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:02)', 'Speech': 'Since I’ve been President, we’ve already seen companies commit, from around the world, from South Korea to in the United States, companies committed $300 billion to build chip factories all across America. $300,000 billion, from New York to Ohio to Arizona. In Ohio, outside of Columbus, I’ve referred to it as the field of dreams. Intel came to me and said they wanted to invest. They’re going to invest $20 billion, already started to build two chip fabs, they call them, factories. Guess what? It’s going to create 12,000 jobs… Excuse me. Yeah, I think it’s 12,000 jobs. 7,000 of them are going to be construction jobs, and the rest are going to be jobs working in those factories.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:54)', 'Speech': 'You know what’s going to happen to those working in those factories? You don’t need a college degree to work in those factories. The average salary is going to be $130,000 a year. Folks, but my budget is about more than chips, it’s about science as well. Like I said, we used 2% of our gross domestic product doing research. Today, we’re getting closer to 1%, but it’s less than 1%. We used to rank number one in the world in research and development. You know where we rank now? Number nine. Nine. China was number eight a decade ago. Guess what? They’re now number two. Number two. This new law in my budget will deliver funding to help us lead the world again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:44)', 'Speech': 'My budget also will invest in critical issues that matter to families. Increasing the supply of affordable housing, lower rental costs, and make it easier to buy a home, all of which will generate economic growth and prosperity. I said to my introducer, he said, “I bought a small home and I worked on it.” I said, “Guess what? That’s how every middle-class family came to be.” Why? Because you build equity in that home. After 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, you may have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 in equity. You can borrow against it to send a kid to school. You can borrow against it to do a lot of things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:23)', 'Speech': 'Folks, look, MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding the police departments and defunding the FBI now. That’s a good one. I like that one. Guess what? They refuse to provide funding that is going to keep communities safe and secure. We talk about crime. My budget invests in public safety. It includes funding for more training, more support for law enforcement at a time when they’re expected to play many roles. We expect our cops to be social workers. We expect them to be psychologists and mental health counselors. More cops are killed responding to domestic violence calls than anything else. Did you know that?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:10)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I don’t want to defund them. They need more help. We don’t expect a cop to be everything from a psychologist to a counselor. These departments need more investment in this kind of help. We’re going to fund proven strategies for accountable and effective community policing so cops know the communities they serve and the communities know them. We got to get cops back on the street, back on the street in the communities they know, where they know the people, where they stop in and they know the guy who owns the liquor store, they know the preacher who runs the local ministry, they know the person who runs the local grocery store.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:54)', 'Speech': 'When we did that in the Biden crime bill, crime just plummeted, because they know folks. I remember I was in Wilmington. My son used to be the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He’d have his folks go out and knock on the doors. There was a lady who called who lived on Fourth Street, in an area that’s kind of tough. She had rented one of these old Victorian homes, the kind that have an outcropping on the corner of the… and she could hear the gangs below, getting ready to do what they’re going to do. But she was scared to death to call anybody, because she knows if they found out it was her, they’d be back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:34)', 'Speech': 'My son made sure the cops gave their phone numbers to the people in the neighborhood with a commitment they’d never say where they got the information. Guess what? Violent crime dropped because she could pick up the phone and call and say, “They’re outside. I can hear them. They’re talking about this is what they’re going to do.” Cops need help. There’s some bad cops, by the way. What we did, my Justice Department just did in Louisville, Kentucky, was long overdue to put those suckers in jail.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:11)', 'Speech': 'By the way, how many cops you know like bad cops? I don’t know many. Not a joke. We’re going to provide 100,000 more community policing officers nationwide and invest in tens of thousands more school nurses and school counselors and mental health help, and going to save communities billions of dollars over time. Every community needs, especially in the wake of this pandemic.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:40)', 'Speech': 'Let’s be clear about another key point of my budget. I guarantee you I will protect Social Security and Medicare without any change. Guaranteed. I won’t allow it to be gutted or eliminated, as MAGA Republicans threatened to do. MAGA Republicans’ proposal is not an answer on Social Security. My budget will not cut benefits, and it definitely won’t sunset programs, like some of my MAGA Republican friends want to do. It will secure Medicare through 2050 and beyond, ensuring that the vital program keeps going strong for generations, without cutting a single penny in benefits.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:27)', 'Speech': 'By the way, did you all happen to see any of the State of the Union Address? Yeah, when those folks were standing up saying, “Liar, Liar. Biden’s a liar.” That gentlelady from the state of Georgia, the mountains there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:10)', 'Speech': 'Now my budget’s going to give working people a fighting chance. It’s going to create good-paying jobs, and we can pay for these jobs by reducing the deficit two ways; like, for example, cutting $160 billion in Medicare expenses is one, but we also have to ask the wealthiest and biggest corporations to begin to pay their fair share, and cutting subsidies for special interest.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:38)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, in my first two years in office, this first two years, I brought down the deficit a record $1.7 trillion, more than any President has in American history, while doing all the rest of this stuff: down. And the budget I’m introducing today is going to reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:07)', 'Speech': 'Another big disagreement with my MAGA Republicans. And by the way, there’s a lot of… This isn’t your father’s Republican Party. There’s a lot of really good Republicans, there really are, but they’re afraid to step out of line because they get primaried and they’ll lose elections. MAGA Republicans, they don’t want things that particularly are going to help working families like healthcare, education, public safety, which are going to raise cost on folks. Look, MAGA Republicans also refuse to raise a single penny in new taxes on the wealthiest people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:43)', 'Speech': 'So now let me ask you. I mean this sincerely. You don’t have to if you feel self-conscious about it, but raise your hand anybody who thinks our present federal tax system is fair. Raise your hand. No, I’m not joking. People making $400,000, you don’t think it’s fair. We found that in the year 2020, when I got elected, 55 major corporations of the Fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal income tax on $40 billion in profit, so I insisted on a horrible thing to burden on them. I introduced legislation making sure that they had to pay a minimum 15%, 15% to corporations. Just 15%. That’s less than any of you pay. Well, guess what? We did those things to grow the economy, create jobs, again working-class folks a fighting chance. That paid for everything and still allowed me to reduce the deficit. Just begin to pay your fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (44:52)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I’m fighting for another proposal. When I got elected there were roughly… don’t hold me to the exact number, because it varies… around 650 billionaires in America. Now there’s over 1000. Know what the average tax they pay, federal tax? 3%. T-H-R-E-E. 3%. No billionaire should be paying a lower tax than somebody working as a school teacher or a firefighter, or any of you in this room. So my plan is to make sure the corporations begin to pay their fair share because it used to be 35%. We cut it down to 21%. I think we should be paying 28%. There’s going to be a real fight in that, but we should be paying more than 21%. I made clear under my plan, and I made this commitment when I ran, and I haven’t broken it yet, and I never will: no one making less than $400,000 will see a penny in federal taxes go up. Not a single penny. Now, why did I do it $400,000? Because I doubt anybody here makes $400,000. I did it to make the case that I’m not going after anything remotely ordinary folks because they’re paying their share. We’re also going to save billions of dollars on going after criminals who commit fraud.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (46:20)', 'Speech': 'A lot of people are saying to me that they don’t like the idea I’m prepared to forgive up to $20,000 if you got a Pell Grant, or $10,000 for anybody who has a student loan during the recession. Well, guess what? We paid, the so-called PPP program, we paid significant. I think it’s $900 billion, I think… don’t hold me to that number, but it’s well over nine… for anybody who had a tough time with their business during the pandemic, so they could pay employees, they could do the… But guess what? You may remember. I was running for office at the time, but you all may remember that I had a big fight with the Former President, and maybe Future President. Bless me, Father. Anyway, all kidding aside. And here’s the deal: what happened was the folks were really going after me for trying to… And by the way, 90% of all the debt forgiveness for student loans will go, under my plan, 90% will go to families making under $75,000 a year. Okay? 90%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (47:49)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal. The PPP program forgave a lot more, and I’m not suggesting they shouldn’t. But the big fight you may remember going on was, what happened was: our good friend, the Former President, decided all the inspectors general, the guys who watch everything… I did a major program under Barack Obama. He asked me to deal with the Deficit Reduction Plan that went on. And guess what? I had all these inspectors checking every decision I made to make sure they were legit. He fired them all. I said, “You shouldn’t do that.” Well, guess what? Now we’re finding out there’s billions of dollars stolen, so my Justice Department is now going after them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:35)', 'Speech': 'We’re doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic, and we’re going to triple our Anti-Fraud Strike Force, double the statute of limitations. We have more time to go after these guys. Crack down on identity fraud and criminal syndicates who stole billions of dollars from the American people. And the studies show, for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back $10, 10 times as much. And let’s get something else straight: my budget cuts wasteful spending by getting rid of special tax breaks for big oil companies who made $200 billion in profit last year in the midst of a worldwide recession, $200 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (49:24)', 'Speech': 'And folks, over the last two years we made a lot of things, a lot of progress, with Republican help as well. Sadly, from what I’m hearing, house representative these days, they’re suggesting a cooperation may have come to an end; that’s why I talk about the MAGA Republicans. This is not your father’s Republican Party, as I said before. MAGA Republicans are threatening to default on the national debt. We keep talking about the national debt and the trillion dollars debt: it took 200 years to accumulate that debt. It’s not recent debt. This is all the debt that’s been accumulating interest on the debt for over 200 years. And by the way, President Trump, when he was president, in four years he increased the national debt by 25% just in four years. Remember that multi-billion-dollar tax break. Did you get any of it? Raise your hand if you you got any of it. No, I’m serious. So folks, 200 years to accumulate, and was added to that administration 25%, did it by themselves.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:28)', 'Speech': 'I met with the new speakers, I said, at the House on how we should proceed to settle our differences without jeopardizing the full faith and credit of the United States America. We have never reneged on that debt. Now they’re telling me, if I don’t do what they want… cut social security, whatever they propose… then they’re going to renege on the debt. Every single major economic institution, conservative or liberal, says that will cause a massive recession, a massive recession, and put us in the hole for a long, long time. Well, folks, here’s what I said: instead of making threats about default, which would be catastrophic, let’s take that off the table. As I said in the beginning, let’s have a conversation about how to grow the economy, lower cost, and reduce the deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:16)', 'Speech': 'I just laid out the bulk of my budget. Republicans and Congress should do the same thing. Then we can sit down and see where we disagree. My Republican friends say they want to reduce the deficit, but we did the math on what they’ve put forward so far: our estimate, I’m happy to be proven wrong, my plan is going to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over 10 years; based on what we know so far about their plan, it’s going to explode the deficit by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. If I’m wrong, show me. I want to cut taxes. They want to cut taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, take away the power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. And as I said, would cut the deficit significantly, $160 billion, just by doing that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:07)', 'Speech': 'And if they say they want to cut the deficit, but their plans would explode the deficit, how are they going to make the math work? What are they going to cut? As I said at the State of the Union, you may have seen the back-and-forth of the MAGA Republicans and me. Through their shouting and unruliness, they seem to say they’re not going to cut social security and Medicare. Well, like I said, what about Medicaid? What about the Affordable Care Act? What about veterans’ benefits? What about law enforcement? What about aid to rural communities? What about support for our military? How will they make these numbers add up? Here’s the deal: if MAGA Republicans and Congress try to repeal the Affordable Care Acts, social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, I’m not going to let them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:57)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we haven’t even talked about my budget for national security or intelligence and foreign policy communities. My budget makes robust investments on our military and defense. Let’s see what the MAGA Republicans propose. And let’s be clear where I stand. I’ll not allow the cuts, the needs of intelligence community or our military, that help keep us safe. We’re the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, and I’ll not let the Republicans diminish our capacity, to cut the benefits to our servicemen or veterans and their family.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:34)', 'Speech': 'I’m going on too long and I apologize. Let me say this one more time. If MAGA Republicans are using the threat of default, for the first time in history they’re risking America’s health and security. It’s dangerous.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:53)', 'Speech': 'Let me close to this: my budget is about investing in America, and all of America, including places and people and folks who have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible. Not anymore. I promise you. I see you. We’ve got work to do, but we’ve made a lot of progress in the first two years; and families across the country are starting to breathe a little easier, but we’ve got further to go. And I can honestly say I have never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today. I mean that sincerely. As you can tell, I’ve only been around a few years, like 400.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:40)', 'Speech': 'Folks, let me conclude by saying we just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I mean it. Nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:56)', 'Speech': 'So God bless you all and may God protect our troops.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:59)', 'Speech': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

Senator Alex Padilla, champion for this community and the entire state. Our good friend, Supervisor Hilda Solis, and all elected officials, law enforcement, first responders, faith leaders, community members, all here today. You’ve shown up for this community, and I know you always will. To the families of victims who spend time, I get a chance to speak with today, and whom Vice President Harris spent time with a few weeks ago, I’m here on behalf of the American people, to mourn with you, to pray with you, to let you know you’re loved and not alone. Every case is different, but I know what it’s like. I know what it’s like to get that call. I know what it’s like to be told. I know what it’s like to lose a loved one so suddenly. It’s like losing a piece of your soul. It’s like a black hole in your chest you feel like you’re being sucked into. Suffocating, hardly able to breathe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:52)', 'Speech': 'The anger, the pain, the depths of the loss so profound, it’s hard to explain. The suddenness tends to magnify the grief. And as time passes, the shock and numbness slowly make way for the sobering reality of their absence. That empty chair at the dinner table, the birthdays, the anniversaries, the holidays without them. Everyday things, small things, the details that you miss the most. The scent when you open that closet door, the park you go by that you used to stroll in, the morning tea you shared together, the bend of his smile, the perfect pitch of her laugh. As Judy shared with me, this is a tight-knit community with intergenerational households and deep reverence and respect for its elders. A community that’s opened its heart, its homes to friends and neighbors, and stood strong throughout the pandemic as anti-Asian hate crimes rose. A community that in the face of horrific tragedy has become a symbol of hope and resilience. Pushing forward together, healing together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:21)', 'Speech': 'People from all faiths and backgrounds rallying to show their love and support, raising money for funeral costs and memorials, providing counseling and translation services to the victims’ families.

They represent a bigger story of who we are as Americans, embodying the simple truth that our diversity, our diversity is the strength of this nation. We saw that strength in Maria Liang, [inaudible 00:09:20] into creating and warm welcome space, [inaudible 00:09:31] seniors. [inaudible 00:09:34] hat strength and Brandon Tsay, who met me at the airport, whom Jill and I have gotten a know. 20 minutes after the rampage at Star Ballroom, Brandon saw the same shooter walk into his family’s own dance studio just two miles away, pointing a gun at him. In an instant, he found the courage to act and wrestle a semi-automatic firearm away. Brandon saved lives. He protected the community. At Half Moon Bay just two days later- You’ve got it. Brandon, stand up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:16)', 'Speech': 'At Half Moon Bay, just two days later, we saw heroism from police officers, firefighters, and other first responders who rushed into the danger to save lives. As many of you know, Jill and I invited Brandon as our guest at the State of the Union message because we wanted the country to know all of you, not just Brandon, all of you. The character of this community, the faith you have in this community, the pride we see across, we see it in you, across all of American life. Just this week, a film about resilience and power of the Asian American immigrant family made history at the Oscars, echoing the heart of so many in this community.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:25)', 'Speech': 'We also hear a message we’ve heard too often, including two years ago this week after the spa shooting in the Atlanta area; enough, do something. We remember and mourn today, but I’m here with you today to act. Last year, after the mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, I signed in law after being both places, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in almost 30 years. That was in addition to me signing more executive actions to reduce gun violence than any of my predecessors at this point in their presidencies. Today, I’m announcing another executive order that will accelerate and intensify this work to save more lives more quickly. First, this executive order helps keep firearms out of dangerous hands, as I continue to call on Congress to require background checks for all firearms sales.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:30)', 'Speech': 'And in the meantime, in the meantime, my executive order directs my Attorney General to take every lawful action possible to move us as close as we can to universal background checks without new legislation. It’s just common sense to check whether someone is a felon, a domestic abuser, before they buy a gun. The executive order also expands public awareness campaigns about the red flag laws, which my son, before he died, Attorney General in Delaware, was a great proponent of it and instituted it. So more parents, teachers, police officers, health providers, and counselors know how to flag for a court that someone is exhibiting violent tendencies, threatening classmates or experiencing suicidal thoughts that make them a danger to themselves and others, and temporarily move that person’s access to firearms.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:36)', 'Speech': 'And it promotes, this executive order, safe storage for firearms, something every responsible gun owner agrees with. Second thing it does, the executive order ramps up our efforts to hold the gun industry accountable. It’s the only outfit you can’t sue these days. It does that by calling out for an independent government study that analyzes and exposes how gun manufacturers aggressively market firearms to civilians, especially minors, including by using military imagery. And it directs the Attorney General to public release, publicly released Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms inspection reports of firearms dealers who are cited for violation of the law.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:30)', 'Speech': 'That way, policymakers can strengthen laws to crack down on those illegal gun dealers and the public can avoid purchasing from them. Third, the executive order improves federal coordination to support victims, survivors, and their families and communities affected by mass shootings, the same way FEMA response to your natural disasters in California and all around the nation. And that they help folks recover and build after wildfires and superstorms and droughts. For example, we need to provide more mental health support for grief and trauma, and more financial assistance when a family loses the sole breadwinner or when a small business shuts down due to a lengthy shooting investigation. There’s more in this executive order, but I’m not stopping there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:26)', 'Speech': 'Last week, I laid out of my budget that we invest more in safer communities and expand access to mental health services for those affected by gun violence. Congressional Republicans should pass my budget instead of calling for cuts in these services or defunding the police or abolishing the FBI, as we hear from our MAGA Republican friends. But let’s be clear, none of this absolves Congress from the responsibility of acting to pass universal background checks, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability. And I’m determined, once again, to ban a assault weapons and high-capacity magazine. I led that fight to ban them in 1994. In the 10 years that law was in place, mass shootings went down. Our Republican friends let it expire, and 10 years later, and mass shootings tripled since then, tripled. So let’s finish the job. Ban assault weapons, ban them again. Do it now, enough, do something, do something big.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:48)', 'Speech': 'Folks, Let me close with this. Scripture says, “The Lord is near to brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” A lot of us have been there. As we gather here today, I know your hearts are broken, but I know your spirits are strong. And as you’re remember and heal, I know the light of your loved one is once again going to lead you forward. It takes time. I tell everyone, at least it did with me, it takes time. But I promise you, I promise you, the day will come when the memory of your loved one brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. The tear will never fully go away, but when you had that smile first [inaudible 00:17:50], that’s when you know, that’s when you know you’re going to make it. You’re going to know you’re going to make it. And my prayer for all of you is that day will come sooner than later, but I promise you, it will come. God bless you all. I admire you so damn much.'}]"

And I know that countless Americans saw their costs drop even more. That’s real money in my pocket folks, money that comes in handy on a fixed income. President Biden lowered the cost of insulin and he has rolled up his sleeves to work on lowering drug costs across the board. Promises made and promises kept. This has been the hallmark of Joe Biden’s presidency and I’m deeply honored to be able to thank him in person and introduce him today. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:20)', 'Speech': 'Now, look, I’ve been a significant consumer of healthcare, my family has. Doctors let you live. Nurses, male or female, make you want to live. No, I’m serious. The single most underrated profession in America are nurses. Nurses. I mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:42)', 'Speech': 'Let me begin by thanking the president of this great university of allowing me to… Oh, take a seat if you have one.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:54)', 'Speech': 'Professor Whitfield, thank you… President. He’s a professor as well, but thank you for allowing me back on campus. I have gotten no additional degrees lately, but thank you for letting me be here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:07)', 'Speech': 'And, David, thanks for that introduction. I really mean it. It makes a difference in people’s lives what we’re doing and what you all are supporting.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:19)', 'Speech': 'And Dina Titus and Steve Horsford, two of the best members of the Congress that I’ve ever worked with. There you are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:31)', 'Speech': 'And we have the attorney general here too.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:38)', 'Speech': 'Folks, Aaron and state and local, Tribal leaders are here. Will the Tribal leaders stand up? Because I don’t know how many are here. There you go, Chief. Good to see you, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:54)', 'Speech': 'By the way, it’s Indian Nations. Indian Nations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:59)', 'Speech': 'And I’m here today to talk about an issue affecting every single American: your healthcare. And I want to first thank the healthcare workers in this room. In the best of times… I really mean it. In the best of times, you do the Lord’s work, but over the last three years during the pandemic, you’ve literally risked your lives for the rest of us. Healthcare workers that put their lives on the line. And it matters. And it really, really matters. I think the American public is beginning to understand just how consequential you are. They’re used to going to the doc, but they’re not used to the doc going into a tough area to take care of them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:36)', 'Speech': 'And we lost a million people, and we could have lost a lot fewer if we started earlier, not because of the docs’ decisions but because of other decisions made.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:45)', 'Speech': 'Oh, wow, I didn’t see you all up there. Holy mackerel. Don’t jump!'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:58)', 'Speech': 'Well, all Americans deserve peace of mind that if the illness strikes or an accident occurs in their family, they can get the care they need but they can afford the care they need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:08)', 'Speech': 'But the truth is: Too many folks lie in bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering what they would do if something happened, if their spouse got a serious illness or if they got very sick, or if their child got sick, if something happens to them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:22)', 'Speech': 'I remember, we lived in a… I was raised in a normal middle-class home back in Delaware, a three-bedroom house with four kids and and a grandpop living with us, a split-level home. And my bedroom was next to my mom and dad’s. Me and my three brothers, we had two sets of bunks. And you could tell when dad was restless.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:44)', 'Speech': 'I remember one night, true story, one night, my dad… I could feel like he was rolling in bed because of the headboard would hit the side of the wall. And the next morning, I asked my… This is the God’s truth. I asked my mom… I was in I think a junior in high school. I said, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “We just lost our insurance. His business is no longer going to cover insurance for employees.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:09)', 'Speech': 'It was a consequential decision. It affected my dad and would have affected… If any one of us had gotten really sick, what happens? Do you have to sell the house? Do you have to make some kind of sacrifice that exceeds what is actually reasonable?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:23)', 'Speech': 'And it’s about your dignity. Do you have enough insurance? Can you afford these medical bills? If it gets bad enough, do you have to do something drastic in order to pay for it?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:33)', 'Speech': 'And for seniors on fixed income who often need expensive medications to stay healthy, the constant question is: Can they pay for their medications? Can they pay the bills without giving up the important elements of their lives? Because the bottom line is: At the end of the month, do you have enough to pay all that you need and take care of the exigencies that occur?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:56)', 'Speech': 'And it’s not just the elderly. It’s almost every family out there. It’s not just your health. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your security. That’s why my administration is focusing intensely on getting more people affordable healthcare by lowering prescription drug costs and giving families just a little bit, as my dad would say, just a little bit of breathing room. We passed the historic laws to get that done. And now we’re moving quickly to implement those laws so people can feel the effects of what we did. We passed them last year, but they didn’t take effect until January.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:28)', 'Speech': 'The first thing we did was to help people who were truly struggling to gain access to affordable healthcare through the Affordable Health Care Act, or better known as Obamacare. I signed a Rescue Plan that increased the coverage and lowered prices for affordable healthcare, saving millions of people about $800 a year. And my new budget for this year makes that permanent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:56)', 'Speech': 'Almost 100,000 Nevadans get their healthcare through the Affordable Health Care Act. And 300,000 have coverage because of expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Health Care Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:07)', 'Speech': 'Unfortunately, my MAGA… And, by the way, I mean it sincerely, this is not a broad criticism of all Republicans. This is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat now that’s in charge. No, think about it. I knew a lot of good Republicans who represented this state as senators. They were friends. We disagreed, but they were conservative Republicans. But these MAGA Republicans, they’re just different. They continue to be determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:45)', 'Speech': 'And, you know, it’s hard to believe, but they’ve already voted to change or get rid of the Affordable Care Act, since it passed, 50 times, five-zero. They failed every time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:57)', 'Speech': 'And the one thing I want you to know about the Affordable Care Act is that, the way for people who have pre-existing conditions to get healthcare. If you have a pre-existing condition and you can’t afford your healthcare, private plans, you do not get coverage anywhere. And this is the only outfit. In fact, you do away with the Affordable Care Act, if you have a pre-existing condition, you don’t get coverage otherwise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:26)', 'Speech': 'If MAGA Republicans had their way, as many as 100 million people with pre-existing conditions would lose their protection. That’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:34)', 'Speech': 'And, folks, look, the Affordable Health Care Act is also a means by which millions of hardworking Americans have access to preventative care like cancer screenings. MAGA Republicans put that at risk as well. Nearly 40 million Americans would be in danger of losing coverage completely if they were to succeed. We’re making healthcare more affordable in other ways as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:56)', 'Speech': 'Last year, I proposed a piece of legislation called the Inflation Reduction Act, which I could… We got a lot of things done bipartisanly. This one, there was not any support on the other team at all. But the result of the law is that seniors on Medicare get common vaccines for things like tetanus, whooping cough, shingles, they get them for free now. It used to cost them up to $200 per shot, average $100 per shot.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:29)', 'Speech': 'The new data released today shows that if our plan had been in place in 2021, 3.4 million seniors, including 24,000 Nevada seniors, would’ve saved an average of $70.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:45)', 'Speech': 'Americans spends more on prescription drugs than any advanced nation on Earth, more than any advanced nation on Earth. You name the drug you have to take, and I can take you to France and get it to you a hell of a lot cheaper, to Canada, England, throughout Europe. It’s not fair. But after decades of trying to take on Big Pharma, we finally, finally won.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:09)', 'Speech': 'Now, instead of paying whatever the drug company wants to charge you, Medicare will be able to negotiate prices. Medicare provides… We’ll drive down prices because we give Medicare the power, the same power that the Department of Veterans Affairs has. They can negotiate what they’re going to pay for whatever drugs they’re prescribing to the military.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:37)', 'Speech': 'Well, I know many of you are healthcare professionals. You understand this better than anybody else.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:42)', 'Speech': 'For example, insulin was invented 100 years ago. And the guy who invented it decided not to patent it because he wanted it to be available. It only costs $10 a vial to make, $10 a vial. If you count everything, you expand it, you could say, you get up to 13 bucks if you talk about packaging, shipping, and the rest. And guess what? They’re being charged hundreds of dollars a vial.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:06)', 'Speech': 'So, beginning January 1st of this year, even though we passed the law last year, it wasn’t until January 1st, I kept telling people it was coming, we capped the cost of insulin at $35, $35 for seniors on Medicare. And, folks, if it had been in effect in 2020, nearly 11,000 Nevada seniors would’ve saved an average of $439 on their insulin.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:34)', 'Speech': 'But I’ve been calling on my colleagues to cap the cost, though, for everyone, including 200,000 children who have type 1 diabetes who need insulin every day to stay alive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:46)', 'Speech': 'I was doing a townhall meeting in Northern Virginia last year, and a woman stood up, a very sophisticated lady, and she said, “I have two girls. They both have type 1 diabetes.” And she said, “And I can’t afford, I can’t afford it. So what we have to do, we have to ration the insulin between them.” Talk about being deprived of your dignity. Imagine looking at your child knowing if they don’t get the insulin, their life is literally in danger. And you’ve got to stand there and not know what to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:17)', 'Speech': 'Folks, my budget is going to require it. And guess what? The good news is that Eli Lilly, the biggest insulin maker in the United States of America, announced that they’re going to answer my call and they’re going to make this insulin available to everyone in America for $35.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:39)', 'Speech': 'And yesterday, Novo Nordisk, another drugmaker, announced they’re cutting their price of insulin as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:45)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, another aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act, and it’s a fancy-sounding phrase, but is the drug companies that raise prices faster than, faster than inflation have to pay back the difference to Medicare. So, if they’re raising the price on insulin and you have the circumstance where the inflation is up 4% and they increase it 12% or 15%, they have to pay the difference to Medicare.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:16)', 'Speech': 'Yesterday I learned that, last quarter, drug companies hiked the prices for 27 drugs that are on the market above the new limit. Now those manufacturers are going to have to pay the difference back to Medicare. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates this will make… Co-pays for those drugs will be as much as $390 cheaper for seniors. Look, it’s going to change the way drugs are priced, lower the costs for seniors long-term.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:44)', 'Speech': 'And it’s equally consequential to me that, as many of you in this room know, we’re capping out-of-pocket drug expenses for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year, beginning next year. Now, but right now, we have… Regardless of how much they cumulatively are paying for all of the drugs they need. And now it’s capped at… Because my family has been deeply involved, as a consequence of cancer and my son dying of stage 3 glioblastoma because he was exposed to those burn pits for a year in Iraq. Anyway, you all… How many here have had you or a family member be diagnosed with cancer? Raise your hand. It’s probably, as the docs know, the most devastating word they can tell a patient. You got a serious heart disease, you may die; that’s worrisome. More people die of heart disease than they do from cancer. But cancer scares the living hell out of every single person.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:56)', 'Speech': 'Well, folks, a lot of those drugs now that are available, that are very helpful… And, by the way, I’ve declared war on cancer. No, I really have. I’ve gotten $5 billion for cancer research through NIH, like we did through the Defense Department for special weapons systems, the same system.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:22)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal: Some people are paying about 10,000, 12, $14,000 a year for expensive treatments like cancer drugs. It’s going to give seniors certain peace of mind, because no matter how much they pay, no matter how much they pay, they’re not going to… how much the bills are, they’ll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all the drugs they consume. It changes the peace of mind people have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:51)', 'Speech': 'And guess what? It’s going to save seniors money. It’s also going to save the government money. And my Republican friends say, “When are you going to cut taxes for the wealthy?” I said, “No, I got a better way of saving money.” Not a joke. If, in fact, you limit the amount of money that can be charged to reasonable prices by the drug companies, you know how much we’ll save this year? $160 billion. $160 billion. Why? Because it’s $160 billion less they have to pay out to provide the drugs for the seniors. So it’s not only the right thing to do, it is a conservative thing to do in terms of cutting the federal budget.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:35)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal. As I’ve said, this is not your father’s Republican Party. The MAGA Republicans in Congress don’t think any of this is a good idea. They think Big Pharma should be able to make the exorbitant profits, at the expense of the American people, they’ve been making. And they want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, roll back savings for seniors, add to the deficit another $1.6 billion, and continue to line the pockets of Big Pharma.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:01)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’m a capitalist. If you can go out and make a lot of money, go make the money. Just pay your fair share. Just your fair share. No, for real.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:11)', 'Speech': 'I have no problems with a company making reasonable profits, but, my Lord, not on the backs of working families and seniors. And this is really, when it gets down to it, it’s about fairness, fairness and decency and providing people with some dignity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:27)', 'Speech': 'Last week, I released my budget. I met, by the way, and I apologize to the press who is here; they’re tired of hearing me say this. I met with the new Speaker of the House. He is threatening that we’re going to let the federal debt not get paid and put us in turmoil. We’ve never done that in American history. And the debt is an accumulation of debt over 200 years. That’s the debt we’re talking about.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:56)', 'Speech': 'I said, “Look, I’ll lay out clearly what we support. I’ll lay out my budget on March the 9th; you lay out your budget, and we’ll negotiate. We’ll negotiate.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:06)', 'Speech': 'Well, my dad used to have an expression, for real. He’d say, “Joey…” When someone would say, “I’ll tell you what I value,” he’d say, “Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what you value.” Show me your budget. No, really. Think about.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:25)', 'Speech': 'My budget takes steps to lift the burden on seniors and hardworking Americans so at the end of the month, after busting their necks their whole lives, they have a little bit left over. That’s what it used to be at our kitchen table: At the end of the month, is there anything left? [inaudible 00:20:39] pay anything, do you have a little bit of room? Again, it’s about fairness, and it’s about your dignity. I value everyone having a decent shot.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:49)', 'Speech': 'My Republican colleagues now in the House of Representatives, I think it’s fair to say, not every one of them, but most of them, are now at a point where they have a very different value set. We’re strengthening Medicare and Social Security instead of threatening to eliminate them, and the MAGA Republicans that are in Congress are threatening to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:07)', 'Speech': 'I don’t know whether you saw the State of the Union, but it was kind of a fascinating thing. No, no, I didn’t say it for that reason. I was in the Senate a long time. I’m used to dealing with and speaking to the Congress and the Senate. And so I’m comfortable when I’m doing them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:22)', 'Speech': 'When I was standing up there before all the members of the House and the Senate, and I talked about… I read the programs which some of their leaders have put forward to, in fact, cut Social Security and cut Medicare. And the gentlelady, as they say, from Georgia, in the mountains of Georgia, stood up and yelled, “Liar! Liar!” Last time somebody did that, by the way, they got censured. No, I’m not joking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:48)', 'Speech': 'But here’s what happened. And then another half a dozen yelled, “Liar! Liar! We’re not going to do that.” I said, “Oh…” If you remember, I said, “Oh, you’re not going to cut Social Security and Medicare?” And they said, “We’re not going to…” And so the whole group… I said, “Everybody who’s not going to cut Social Security and Medicare, stand up.” They stood up and hollered. Well, they’re all on film. I hope it’s true. I hope they’ve gotten there, but I’ll believe it when I see it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:18)', 'Speech': 'Look, you paid for Social Security from the time you got your first check when you were 16 years old, working as a lifeguard or something. Okay? And I’m determined to protect them both. There’s ways to protect them without cutting them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:34)', 'Speech': 'Look, let me close with this. Let’s finish the job. Let’s protect the lower prescription drug costs for everyone. Let’s expand healthcare for more people to get care. Let’s keep building the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:50)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, when that happens, when the middle does well and the bottom rises, the wealthy still do very, very well. And no one, I commit to you, and I committed to this when I got elected, when I was running: No one making less than $400,000 will see a penny in federal taxes raised as long as I’m President of the United States of America. But, again, it’s about just paying a fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:20)', 'Speech': 'When I got elected, there were… I think it was, don’t hold me to the exact number, 690 billionaires in America. There’s now a thousand. You know what the average federal tax they pay is? T-H-R-E-E percent. Three. They pay a lower tax rate than the custodians in this building. They pay a lower tax rate than any of you, basically. And so, it’s just not fair. I think you should be able to be a billionaire if you can earn it, but just pay your fair share. Just pay something.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:57)', 'Speech': 'By the way, you know everybody said, well, how was I able to have these new programs and still cut the deficit $1.7 trillion the last two years? Well, it’s pretty straightforward. There were 550 companies of the Fortune 500 that made $40 billion that didn’t pay a penny in tax, zero, nothing in taxes. So I said they’re outrageous. And we got votes for it. I said they ought to pay a minimum of 15%. 15%. That’s less than you all pay. And guess what? It allowed me to cut the deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:36)', 'Speech': 'So, folks, this is about just basic fairness and decency. There’s nothing radical about what I’m proposing. And if you look at the polling data, it’s overwhelmingly popular what we’ve proposed. As a matter of fact, it’s a hell of a lot more popular than I am. But I’m serious. So, this is no time to turn around.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:56)', 'Speech': 'Look, the American people understandably, a lot of people have lost faith in government for a lot of reasons. And here’s the deal: We promised these things, and they haven’t seen it. I don’t know whether you’ve been surprised, but the number of people who have come up to me after January 1st saying, “You cut my insulin costs. $35.” Like, “I didn’t believe government would really do it.” But there’s a lot more coming. A lot more coming.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:29)', 'Speech': 'And, again, let me end by thanking the medical people that are here and the students. It really matters. It really, really, really matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:39)', 'Speech': 'And all of you have to do, like many people in this audience have been significant consumer of healthcare. My son spent 18 months knowing he was dying in the hospital. And the docs and nurses just changed it. They took care of him.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:03)', 'Speech': 'My wife and daughter killed in a trucking accident. My two boys were expected not to live. You guys saved them and you saved their sanity as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:17)', 'Speech': 'So, I think that we vastly underestimate and you underestimate the psychological impact you have on people, not just the medical impact you have on them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:28)', 'Speech': 'So, I’m here to say: Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:31)', 'Speech': 'And, folks, let’s remember: Don’t forget we are the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So let’s work together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:46)', 'Speech': 'God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.'}]"

Invest in ourselves, and'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:00)', 'Speech': 'Here’s what it looks like across the country: A record 12,400,000 brand-new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs just since we came to office. That’s more jobs in two years. That’s more jobs in two years than any President has created in four years. And that’s because of this group sitting right in front of you, you just heard from.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:24)', 'Speech': 'It means we’re recovering every single lost job in the pandemic, and created 3 million more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:29)', 'Speech': 'Instead of exporting jobs to get cheaper labor costs, that’s what we did for decades. We used to lead the world, by the way, in investments. But what we started to do, we started exporting jobs and importing product, generating deficits. Now we’re creating American jobs and exporting American products and growing our economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:54)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, we’ve attracted commitments for more than $435 billion in private investment in less than two years, in American manufacturing and American energy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:09)', 'Speech': 'Look, and we’ve announced over 23,000 infrastructure, construction jobs, projects in over 4,500 cities and towns all across America; groundbreakings for new roads and bridges and airports; projects to deliver clean water, high-speed Internet to homes and schools. And we’re going to clean your Great Lakes while we’re at it, by the way. Plus, my economic plan is building more clean energy future made in America. Not abroad, made in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:44)', 'Speech': 'For example, we’re building a network of 500,000 electric vehicle stations by the IBEW all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:53)', 'Speech': 'And right here in Minnesota, when you’re driving across I-94 or taking I-35 through the Twin Cities, charging stations will be easy to find, as easy as it is to find a gas station today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:08)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we’re providing incentives for companies like Cummins to manufacture clean energy technology right here in Minnesota. For over a century, Cummins has built diesel engines and heavy-duty trucks and power generators. Over half of all medium- and heavy-duty trucks on the road today have Cummins engines.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:28)', 'Speech': 'Well, today you’ve made generators for the Department of Defense for decades, as I walked through and saw them. World War II, 50% of all the diesel and gas generators used by the Allies in the war came from Cummins.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:42)', 'Speech': 'But when Cummins first manufactured hydrogen electrolyzers, they had to make them overseas. These are the machines that make clean hydrogen, a renewable energy used to power our economy, from clean cars to trucks to steel to cement manufacturing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:59)', 'Speech': 'But now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act with the tax credits for renewable energy, Cummins is going to manufacture these electrolyzers here in America for the first time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:10)', 'Speech': 'And Cummins is turning this part of the factory, where we’re standing now, into a new production line for clean energy technology.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:27)', 'Speech': 'Here at this plant, 600 workers now making diesel engines will be re-trained, and an additional 100 jobs, so a total of 700 jobs will be making clean energy technology. You know, what we’re seeing is a boon for American innovation, American industry, and it’s good for the planet as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:46)', 'Speech': 'Already, Cummins has signed contracts for clean hydrogen for producers and utilities in New York, Florida, and Washington State, and it’s just beginning. Just beginning. Think about what it means for our supply chain and our communities.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:02)', 'Speech': 'Before the pandemic, the supply chain wasn’t something most Americans spent much time thinking about. But today, after delays for parts and products, everyone knows why supply chains are so important. Instead of relying on equipment made overseas in places like China, the supply chains will be again made in America. They’ll begin in America. Begin in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:25)', 'Speech': 'Cummins will build the technology that produces clean hydrogen. Companies and utilities across the country will use those products to make clean hydrogen. And trucks made in America with zero-emission engines will be powered by clean hydrogen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:39)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, that includes Cummins, which just today announced that it will invest over $1 billion at a plant in New York and Indiana and North Carolina to produce low-carbon, zero-emission engines for trucks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:53)', 'Speech': 'And the point here is that it’s all made in America rather than overseas. It’s a game-changer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:07)', 'Speech': 'And, folks, where is it written that America can’t once again be the manufacturing capital of the world? Where is that written? We used to be.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:20)', 'Speech': 'Well, we’re telling a different story here at Cummins and over at Becker, where Xcel Energy is investing $600 million to build the largest solar farm in the state. Plus, we’re building a solar storage facility at that site with innovative batteries made in West Virginia.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:37)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, companies have announced over $2 billion in major manufacturing investments in Minnesota alone. Just Minnesota. And we’re bringing other key parts of the supply chain back to America, like semiconductors, which you just heard about. These are the small computer chips about the size of the tip of my little finger that affect everything in our lives, from our cellphones, automobiles, refrigerators, so much more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:04)', 'Speech': 'America invented these chips. We invented them. We made them smaller. We made them faster. We made them more powerful. But then something happened about four, five decades ago. American manufacturing, the backbone of our economy, got hollowed out. Companies moved jobs overseas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:21)', 'Speech': 'We used to produce up to 40% of the world’s chips, but today we’re down to producing 10%, 10% of the world’s chips, we, despite our leading the world in research and design for these new technologies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:33)', 'Speech': 'But why does this matter? Well, we saw it during the pandemic. When the global economy came to a halt, overseas factories that make these chips shut down, driving up costs for American families, families all over, but American families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:46)', 'Speech': 'One third of the core inflation in the year 2021 was because of the high price of new automobiles. Every new vehicle that’s built needs about 3,000 chips per vehicle. During the pandemic, auto companies couldn’t get enough chips. Prices went up because cars were in short supply. And companies like Cummins felt the shortage as well. Your CEO told me herself that many of your products do not run without semiconductors.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:17)', 'Speech': 'Now we’re turning things around in a big way. All over the country, semiconductor countries are investing hundreds of billions of dollars, over $300 billion, a record amount of money, to bring chip production back home. In Ohio, when I visited these facilities, in Ohio, what I call a field of dreams, 20 miles outside of Columbia, Intel has committed $20 billion to build three new fabs there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:43)', 'Speech': 'New York, IBM has committed $20 billion to build chips in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Micron has committed $20 billion to build in Syracuse and has committed, if that goes, to do another $100 billion. In Arizona, TSMC has committed $40 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:27)', 'Speech': 'Here in Minnesota, Governor Walz and members of his legislature are working to invest $500 million in matching funds for semiconductors and biomanufacturing to go along with our federal investment. Plus, your governor signed a historic law to deliver 100% carbon pollution-free electricity across the state – as one of the senators mentioned – across Minnesota by 2040. By 2040. Hubert Humphrey would be proud. We’re working to ensure our clean energy manufacturing future is also one that supports America’s working families with good – and I don’t want to make anybody mad, but I make no apology – good union jobs to pay a prevailing wage. Listen, I know many here in Minnesota are watching at home are like the folks I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware. You feel left out, left behind in an economy that’s rapidly changing. I get it. I get it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:32)', 'Speech': 'But hear me well: We’re going to leave no one behind. We’re going to make sure all American workers with college degrees, without college degrees are prepared to compete with anyone in the world in the remainder of this century. We’re working with companies, community colleges, technical schools, union led registered apprenticeships, training programs to make sure this happens. And in Minnesota, an agricultural powerhouse that has helped feed and fuel the country and the world, I’m working closely with Minnesota members of the House and Senate Committees to make sure we get a farm bill passed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:13)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, as the Secretary of Agriculture told me a long time ago, the first completely clean energy technology is going to come from farming. Because what you’re doing – I won’t get into all that now, but – it’s important. It’s a big deal. And it’s not just clean energy manufacturing. We’re investing $2.7 billion in over 180 infrastructure projects just in Minnesota. I-90, we’re repairing 10 bridges, improving ramps and traffic signals to reduce traffic and make driving safer. Replacing the main roof over Terminal 1 at the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, so it’s cooler in the summer and can heat it in the winter. And Duluth and across the Great Lakes region, we’ve committed $1 billion to clean up reservoirs and waterways. And already, nearly 200,000 Minnesota families now have affordable high speed internet they didn’t have two years ago because of the infrastructure law. And these investments mean – by the way, your moms and dads who didn’t have that internet available to you, next time your kid has to do homework online, you don’t have to pull up in front of a McDonald’s and work off their power. I’m not joking. All these investments mean that now if you grow up in Minnesota or you go to a school of Minnesota, you can stay in Minnesota. The Midwest is coming back screaming. Good jobs you can raise a family on. You don’t have to hear your son or daughter say, “Mom, I love it here, but there’s no work for me. I got to leave.” None of this is happening by accident. It’s not just happening in Minnesota. It’s all part of my agenda to invest in America, American jobs, American innovation, pride in our country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:03)', 'Speech': 'A word my dad most often used is: Every worker deserves to be treated with dignity – with dignity. And there are families looking for that as well. Folks, and by the way, we can afford everything I just explained and reduce the deficit by asking – you know, by the way, you got – we have about a thousand billionaires now in America. You know the average tax rate they pay in taxes? 3%. T-H-R-E-E. You know what paid for all this? You’ve heard me talk a lot about the fact that there were 55 Fortune 500 companies that made $40 billion, didn’t pay a single penny in taxes. We did an awful thing. They’re paying 15% now. But they’re paying for everything.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:55)', 'Speech': 'Now, anybody thinks the tax system is fair, raise your hand. All right. We found one millionairess right over there. If she’s not married, propose to her quickly. Look, guys, wealthiest Americans and biggest corporation – and I come from the corporate capital of the world. Delaware has more corporations incorporated in the state than every other states in the United States of America combined. And I’m a Democrat and I won seven times for the Senate in that state.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:29)', 'Speech': 'It’s just paying your fair share and cutting the subsidies for special interests. Why are we subsidizing oil companies? Anyway, under my plan, nobody earning – this is a commitment I made when I started, and I’ve kept it and I’ll keep it as long as I’m here – no one making less than $400,000 a year going to pay one single penny extra in federal taxes. Not one. And for example, because the law that I worked on for decades and got signed into law last year with the help of your congressional delegation took on big pharma.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:04)', 'Speech': 'Now, look, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any nation in the world. You’re shaking your head no, Jack, but I’m telling you, it is true. Any nation in the world. Well, guess what? Down over at the Veterans Department, they can negotiate the prices they’re going to pay for the drugs that they’re going to supply for our military in need because it’s a big market. Well, guess what? We’ve been trying for years and years to make sure that Medicare could negotiate with the drug companies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:40)', 'Speech': 'Well, Medicare finally has the power to negotiate lower drug prices. And with lower drug prices, you know what it’s going to do? It’s going to save the taxpayers $160 billion a year. Save them. You know why? How many of you know anyone who needs insulin because they have Type 1? Well, you were paying 4 to 600 bucks a month for it depending on where you’re from.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:12)', 'Speech': 'Now, because of these folks in front of me here, don’t have to pay more than $35. You know why? That’s fair for simple reason. You know how much it cost to make it, insulin? $10. $10. Been around for a hundred years, $10. By, there’s a couple other provisions there. If your mom or dad, God bless them, are on expensive prescription drugs and God forbid they get cancer, well, they can pay as much as 14,000 bucks a year for the cancer drugs they need. Not anymore.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:57)', 'Speech': 'Beginning in 2025, guess what? All'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:46)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, the last guy who had this job, he increased it by $2 trillion deficit. Look, the budget I’ve introduced now reduces the deficit by nearly three trillion over the next 10 years. But folks, unfortunately this is not your father’s Republican Party. I have gotten, no reason why you should know anything about me, but I’ve gotten on well with my Republican colleagues over the years, for real, good relationships.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:21)', 'Speech': 'But this ain’t your father’s Republican Party. This is what I call the Maga Republicans. The Maga Republicans in Congress threatened to undo all this progress. They’re put in our economy in jeopardy by threatening to refuse to pay America’s bills that took 200 years to accumulate now, by the way, not this year’s, last year’s, 200 years. They said they’re not going to pay the bill, which would, for the first time America would default on its debt, which would throw us not only in recession, but would be a disaster for the economy internationally.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:57)', 'Speech': 'And they want to cut taxes, cut more taxes for the very large corporations. They want the power we just gave to Medicare, negotiate lower drug prices. They call a huge giveaway and they want to eliminate it. They want to. I mean, you just turn on the television, you hear them talk, or turn on some channels like Fox, you’ll hear them talk. Big pharma increased the deficit of the cost of the taxpayers by another two billion bucks. Look, basically what we know so far, their plans would explode the deficit, increasing it by more than 3 trillion in the next 10 years. And they also want to cut the investments in clean energy manufacturing and encourage companies to expand and create jobs here. Look, as I said, this clean energy proposal we have, it’s $368 billion. It seems like our Republican friends want to seed clean energy future to China, make us dependent on overseas supply chains, export jobs overseas, and weaken our energy security.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:03)', 'Speech': 'The Maga Republicans in Congress also want to cut The CHIPS and Science Act, stripping our investments for the next generation of science and technology from bio-manufacturing to quantum computing. Take away, get rid of it. That would mean seating the future of innovation and technology to China. Well, I’ve got news for my Maga Republican friends. Not on my watch, not on my watch.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:25)', 'Speech': 'I’m not going to let them undo the progress we’ve made. Look I may close with this. I’ve been determined to make things in this country again, to build manufacturing capacity in America, to make sure we’re never again in a position as we were during the pandemic and relying on other countries to make things we need badly at home. Some folks didn’t believe we could do that, but we made it. We made no bones about it. I’ve said for a long time, if we invest in America, we can change the country’s future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:07)', 'Speech': 'We have the best scientists in the world. We have the best research universities in the world. We’re the most productive workers in the world. When I asked the South Korean country why it was going to invest over a hundred billion in the United States, move their semiconductor factories here, you know what they said? “You have the best workers in the world and the safest country in the world.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:27)', 'Speech': 'That’s what the President of the Auschwitz said. But too long, we sat on our hands, how long in God’s name can we remain the most competitive nation in the world without investing in America? And 30 years ago, we invested 2% of our entire gross domestic product, that’s everything we did, 2% of that we invested in research and development, pure research. By the time I came to office, that was down to 0.7%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:58)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to turn that around. We’re proving it’s never been a good bet to bet against America. I’ve never been more optimistic. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of our country. And just remember, it’s just important to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. I believe that with every fiber in my being, when we work together, there’s nothing can stop us. And that’s my intention, work with whatever will help get this thing moving. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

That wasn’t bad, but we’ll give it another go. This time, I want everyone from right down on his home street of Garden Street to the Market Square in Ballina where we’ve got big screens, from Pierce Street, up Bar [inaudible 00:00:44] and down the Key, to hear on the banks of the historic River Moy, behind the cathedral. Are we ready to give President Biden a homecoming welcome? Tonight we are celebrating in Ballina. We are celebrating our history, our heritage, our culture, and most importantly, our people. We’re celebrating each and every person from County Mayo and afar that has come here tonight on this historical occasion. We’re also remembering tonight, the people who are no longer with us, who are part of the fabric that have made us who we are. Proud County Mayo people and proud Irish people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:34)', 'Speech': 'The Ballina story was not always celebratory, we’ve had our difficult times. On these streets and on these lane ways during famine, so many people died and emigrated. Many went to Scranton, our sister city in the USA. They went in search of a better life. One man, Edward Blewitt, went to Scranton. Like many of him from this area, thousands of us from County Mayo, went to Scranton and went down into the coal mines, worked the railways. But coming out of those coal mines came hope and came the Edward Blewitt story that has now become the Joe Biden story. In Scranton, like Ballina, we know where we’ve came from, we’re proud of who we are. And in just a few moments time, the president of the USA is back for the third time in Ballina, County Mayo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:54)', 'Speech': 'The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, will speak next. After Taoiseach speaks, I hope that you give a rousing powerful western soulful homecoming welcome to the 46th President of the United States of America, President Joe Biden. Have a great night.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:27)', 'Speech': 'Please welcome Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:51)', 'Speech': '[foreign language 00:04:00]. A county very close to my heart as well as your own, and thank you for choosing to make this such a big part of your visit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:10)', 'Speech': 'The story of Ireland can be told through poetry and music, but most eloquently it’s expressed through our people. It’s a story of longing for a better life, a better society, and a better world. A story of unimaginable courage in the face of loss. And above all, it’s a story of love, for country, for family, and for community. It’s your story, Mr. President, as well as our own. Thank you for your lifelong commitment to peace on our island, your friendship, your leadership that you’ve shown in protecting all that has been achieved, and for everything that you’re helping to do to build a better future here, in America and around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:59)', 'Speech': 'In this place, hope and history are not often far apart. 25 years ago when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, to use the words of Maya Angelou, my favorite American poet, we released our fingers from fists of hostility and allowed the pure air to cool our palms. History reminds us, despite this wrenching pain cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage need not be lived again. By facing our past together, on our island we learned a brave and startling truth. That nothing is ever a truly impossible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:43)', 'Speech': 'In the darkest days of our country’s history, the Blewitts and the Finnegans and countless other families left these shores for a better life in the New World, Mayo has changed considerably, and Ireland has changed considerably, since Edward Blewitt fled these shores during the worst days of the famine. We were a country at the time starved of food, of medicine, in despair. Starved of opportunity, and starved for even longer, of basic rights and freedoms. A country that was being denuded of its people, a country that was not in charge of its own affairs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:22)', 'Speech': 'Today, Mayo, as you’ve witnessed, is linked to the world by fiber and by air. It’s connected to communities across the globe through its people. Mayo is home to American companies that provide good jobs for so many people, and a new technological university which provides the greatest passport for all, an education. Here outside St. Muredach’s Cathedral, we must rededicate ourselves to playing our part in the fight between darkness and light, despair and hope, injustice and dignity. We pray for the wisdom to guide us, the words to speak up for those without a voice, the shield to protect our planet and the strength to do what is right always.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:08)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, we know that your life story reminds us that although tragedy may shape us, it never solely defines us. Love of country, of family, and of each other, moves us forward, providing new hope and inspiring others along the way. President Biden, you are the most Irish of all American presidents. Not because of what is written on your family tree, but because of what is enshrined in your soul. We didn’t need to gather here today in our tens of thousands to say, “Welcome back to Ireland.” Because in your heart, you never left. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We look forward to your words.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:35)', 'Speech': 'Mary. I see the light. Hello Mayo. It’s great to be here with you all. It’s great to be back in Ballina during your 300th anniversary. This town is the home of Ireland’s first female president, one of your youngest mayors, and maybe to be Ireland’s first female astronaut, Nora Patton. Mr. Mayor, thank you for welcoming back to town and I also want to thank the Taoiseach for his remarkable hospitality, his generous remarks, and maybe most importantly for his friendship. I want to thank the bands that played earlier. God, you guys are amazing in academics. Let’s give another big hand, by the way, to the Chieftains.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:26)', 'Speech': 'I remember being with you back in 2016. I’m grateful you came back for one more time to perform tonight. Thank you the Chieftains, your music is incredible and I’ve been a long time fan. My good friend, my good friend Enda Kenny, former Taoiseach, a Mayo man is here with Finola’s wife, God love her. She’s going to go straight to heaven. I love you both, but most of all, I want to acknowledge my family. All the Blewitts, you make me proud. You make me proud. All year. The words of the great Mayo poet Antoine Raftery, have been ringing in my head and it goes like this. He said, ‘Now the spring is coming. I shall raise my sail since it entered my head. I won’t stay still until I shall stand in the center of county Mayo’. I mean that I had to be here. My son, hunter and my sister Valerie and I made several stops across Mayo today we visited Knock Shrine where I was hosted by Father Richard Gibbons. We also met out of the blue. We didn’t know he was there, a former military chaplain, father O’Grady, who gave my son, last rights in Walter Reed Medical Hospital in Washington. It was incredible to see him. It seemed like a sign. We traveled up to North Mary Heritage Center where I learned even more about my roots in Mayo. Roots that led me back here to Ballina and the St.Muredach, what a magnificent cathedral. I also learned, if you go far enough back, you can find a record of one. Edward Blewitt who worked for several years in the ordinance survey mapping his entire area of Ireland. But even before that, it turns out he worked in the old Ballina brickyard. We found a record, or I should say the historical slide. He found a record for me in 1828. He was paid 21 pounds and 12 shillings to help supply this bricks for this cathedral. 27,000 of them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:50)', 'Speech': 'I was able to hold one of them in my hand today, they’re damn heavy. As he labored. I’m sure Everett imagined that one day his family would worship here, that his children would be baptized here like his son Patrick was, and that future generations of his family would mark the milestones of their lives here in this sturdy walls. But I doubt he ever imagined his great, great, great grandson will return 200 years later as president of the United States of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:24)', 'Speech': 'Isn’t that amazing?, and I want to thank you. I want to say thank you. I heard you all had an impromptu celebration the night I was declared the winner in 2020 election, you decked out the town, I’m told in red, white, and blue with cars and crowds gathering the market square, singing the green and the red of Mayo. Well, I tell you what it means the world to me. It meant the world to me and my entire family to be embraced as Mayo Joe, son of Ballina. My mother, my grandmother, whose maiden name was Blewitt. They’re smiling down on me right now and I can tell you what that song speaks to me. It goes like, ‘Oh, the feeling that came over me to stay forevermore, forevermore. Stay forevermore and on the green and red of mayo. Oh, the green and red of mayo. Oh, the green and red of Mayo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:24)', 'Speech': 'The truth of it is being here does feel, I know I’m going to say it feels like coming home. It really does. Over the years, stories of this place have become part of my soul, part of my family lore. It was here where I imagine my great, great, great grandfather took shade under yew trees after a long day at the Brickyard. It was here I imagine his children climbed the limestone cliffs and played in the muddy bogs and fished in the river more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:00)', 'Speech': 'It was here where I imagined one of those children, my great-great-grandfather, Patrick, stood on the shores of Clew Bay and dreamt of becoming a seamen. When Patrick was just a teenager. He set sail for America for the first time. But in 1850s, the famine hit Mayo particularly hard. He returned to Ballina to gather the entire Blewitt clan, mom, dad, and all the children. And together they boarded the Excelsior to sail to the United States. Just as I imagine their life here in county Mayo, I can only imagine how hard it must have been to leave it all behind to leave the only place they ever called home and to hold out hope on shores beyond like so many other men and women of Mayo. Edward and Patrick carried'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:04)', 'Speech': 'But while Edward had the head of a scientist, he had the heart of a poet. Years ago, after my mom died, a lot of the belongings were in my attic. I couldn’t get myself to go through them, to empty the boxes. But when I finally did, you know what I found in the attic among my mother’s keepsakes? Over 100 poems written by Edward Blewitt, Senator Edward Blewitt. And one from 1919, he wrote of his Ireland: “From the fairest land, except my own, beneath stars and moon and sun, a citadel of liberty, my mother’s land, Aroon.” It was in Scranton, where my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, met and married my dad, Joseph R. Biden Sr. He was a wonderful man, but his saving grace in the eyes of the Finnegans was he had a Hanafee from Galway as his mother’s side. It rescued the fact Biden’s an English name.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:09)', 'Speech': 'Together, they raised me and my siblings with a fierce pride in our Irish ancestry, a pride that spoke to both the history that binds us, but more importantly the values that unite us. To this day, I can still remember hearing my dad say at the dinner table, “Joey…” And I give you my word as a Biden, this is absolutely true. He’d say, “Joey, everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.” I can still hear my mom tell me, “Joey, nobody’s better than you, but everybody’s your equal.” These are the same values I’ve tried to pass down to my children and grandchildren, whom I’ve always dreamed of bringing to Ireland. In 2016, when I was Vice President, that dream became a reality. Three generations of my family walked along Garden Street, where Edward Blewitt, the brickmaker and surveyor, lived with this family.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:14)', 'Speech': 'It was on Garden Street we learned the true meaning of the Celtic expression, “A hundred thousand welcomes.” Matter of fact, I think I shook a hundred thousand hands that day. I also met the extended cousins, who instantly felt like family I’d grown up with on Sunday dinners on every single week. This strong bond brought me back in 2017 when I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. No crowds, no motorcades, no Secret Service, just me and my brother, Jimmy, coming home to see family. During, the trip I had the honor of turning the sod at Roscommon Hospice. As many of you know, that hospice is now open, and thanks to my cousin, Laurita Blewitt and many of those… She’s incredible by the way. And many of those, there’s a marker. There’s a marker laid there in remembrance of my son. Beau passed away in 2015, a decorated war hero from… Attorney General to Delaware, after a valiant fight with brain cancer. So I can tell you how special it is that a piece of his legacy lives here among his ancestors. And thinking about it, I can hear my dad’s voice again. He’d always say, “Joey, remember, family is the beginning, the middle, and the end.” Beginning, middle, and end. That’s the Irish of it. The beginning, the middle, and end. Everything between Ireland and America runs deep. Our history, our heritage, our sorrows, our future, our friendship, our joys. But more than anything, hope is what beats in the hearts of all our people. For centuries, even during times of darkness and despair, hope has kept us marching forward toward a better future, one of greater liberty, greater dignity, and greater possibilities. In the earliest days of my nation’s history, thousands of Scots-Irish, alongside George Washington, defended those ideals, and then those democratic ideals were under threat during my nation’s civil war. That’s when the Irish immigrants who came after the famine, more than 150,000 of them, joined the fight to defend the liberty and equality, many serving in the legendary Irish Brigade.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:47)', 'Speech': 'When one other Irish Catholic president, only other one, John F. Kennedy, visited Ireland 60 years ago… You can clap for him, man. He was something else. He presented your parliament with a flag of the regiment of that Irish Brigade, honoring Ireland’s great contributions to American freedom. It still hangs there to this day. It’s a legacy of faith and fidelity to freedom to one another that has been handed down generation to generation to generation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:21)', 'Speech': 'Today, the United States continues to honor that legacy, including that one of a Mayo-born Marine named Patrick Gallagher. Patrick immigrated to New York in 1962. He worked for the Senate campaign of one of my political heroes, Robert F. Kennedy. A few years later, when he wasn’t even a US citizen, Patrick joined the United States Marine Corps and deployed to Vietnam. In January of 1966, Patrick’s team was attacked in an ambush. When the enemy hurled a grenade at his team, Patrick threw himself on top of that grenade. He was willing to sacrifice his life to save his brothers in arms. He survived that attack today, but was awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery. Sadly, he was later killed in action, but this year his name will be honored in iron as the United States launches a new Navy destroyer, the USS Patrick Gallagher, from Mayo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:28)', 'Speech': 'You know, I’ve often said that we Irish are the only people who are actually nostalgic about the future. We always believe in a better tomorrow. It’s because no matter what, we’ve always, always carried hope in our hearts. It’s hope that lifted the way through the darkness and lighted it for us. Our strength has helped us overcome everyday hardships.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:39)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, our world today stands at an inflection point where the decisions we make today are going to affect our futures for decades to come. And it’s in these moments where we need hope and courage more than ever. We’re facing enormous challenges around the world, challenges that are too great for any one country to solve alone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:06)', 'Speech': 'Together we must take on these challenges of disease, food insecurity, which continue to devastate communities around the world, just as they did in Ireland generations ago. And I’m so proud to say that Ireland has not forgotten. You’ve stepped up as a leader to fight global hunger around the world today. We must tackle the climate crisis, those devastating impacts, to preserve our planet for generations to come. As I said to the Parliament, Ireland’s famous 40 shades of green now include green energy, green agriculture, and green jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:51)', 'Speech': 'And with Russia’s brutal aggression, brutal war of aggression, shattering the peace of Ukraine, and in Europe, we must renew our commitment to our values our ancestors fought for. What do we Irish fight for? Freedom, democracy. It always must be defended. And I want to thank you. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for an incredible generosity you’ve shown like so many other Irish families across this country who have opened up their hearts and homes to tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s brutal violence. I’ve been there many times. Ireland remembers! Ireland remembers!'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:37)', 'Speech': 'So let me end where I began, with the bricks of this cathedral. Only 200 years ago, the bricks touched by my great-great-great-grandfather, and his hands still hold up this storied nave and hold it aloft like the Irish American story itself. It’s a testament to our shared past, present and our future. It speaks to the sweat of the workers who raised the spire skyward brick by brick just as they did in communities all across my home country. Over 32 million Americans claim to be of Irish heritage, more would if they could.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:28)', 'Speech': 'And I imagine all the hope and hard work embodied in those Irish hearts inspired another one of my great-great-grandfather’s Edward Francis Blewitt’s poems. This one was from 1925, toward the end of his life. He called it The Workers. It goes like this: “The march of progress cannot cease while hearts and minds and heart and souls are bound in faith to sublime things.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:01)', 'Speech': 'My friends, people of Mayo, this is a moment to recommit our hearts, our minds, our heart and souls to the march of progress, to lay the foundation’s brick by brick, by brick, for a better future for our kids and our grandkids, one of greater liberty, opportunity and dignity, just like our ancestors did for us. I’ve never been more optimistic, and I’ve been doing this a long time. I’ve never been more optimistic about what we can achieve if we stick together and stick to our values.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:39)', 'Speech': 'This is a time of enormous possibilities. And united by history, heritage, and hope, and maybe most of all by courage, nothing is beyond our reach. Every time I walked out of my grandfather Finnegan’s home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he yelled, “Joey, keep to faith!” Then I’d hear someone from the house yell, “No, Joey, spread it!” May God protect all those who serve the cause of peace.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:18)', 'Speech': 'And, oh, one more thing. Mayo for Sam! Mayo for Sam! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

His hard work and sacrifice has allowed me to raise our daughters and return to school to work towards my career.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:18)', 'Speech': 'A little over a year ago, I was given the privilege of introducing the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden, when she visited Bergen Community College. I was able to share my experience as a student parent with access to free childcare. I am so thankful for all the support I received, including fundings provided under the American Rescue Plan that allowed me to have access to free childcare while working towards my associate’s degree. I was able to complete my degree with honors all while my daughters were being cared for.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:47)', 'Speech': 'Now though, while working towards my bachelor’s in the science of nursing, we’re in the same position as most families: trying to find affordable care that is safe while juggling work and school obligations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:59)', 'Speech': 'All you need to start a fire is a spark. My family was that spark. And free childcare was what allowed my fire to continue to burn. The greatest part is seeing the pride reflected on my daughter’s faces. I want them to see that you can truly achieve anything you set your mind to. They said they want to be doctors so they can work with mommy, so I guess it’s working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:27)', 'Speech': 'Free childcare helped propel my education, and though I’m no public speaker, it is something I truly believe in and I’m proud to speak on, which is why it is an honor to introduce someone who always fights for hardworking families like mine, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:00)', 'Speech': 'And former Speaker Pelosi, members of the Congress, members union labor that are here today that make a lot of this possible, so many of you, thank you for being here. The Vice President’s in Nevada today fighting for reproductive rights for women, but I know she wanted to be here as well because this is an issue she’s worked on her whole career.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:22)', 'Speech': 'And I want to thank members of the Congress who have spent decades in the trenches fighting for this issue. I want to thank the advocates and the proud union members who are here. Without you, none of this progress, in my view, would be possible. And by the way, that’s why every worker needs to be free to make the choice to join a union.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:49)', 'Speech': 'And thank you care workers and family caregivers for doing God’s work, taking care of our children, our parents, and those we love so dearly. You care for the people we value the most in the whole world and I want you to know how much we value you and I mean that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:06)', 'Speech': 'We’re here today to take action on an issue that’s fundamental to who we are as a nation, who we are as a country: How do we treat the people we care so much about? Who needs the most help – our children, the people we love, people with disabilities including veterans. And how do we value those caring for them – childcare workers, nurses, home care workers, family caregivers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:34)', 'Speech': 'The executive order I’m about to sign is the most comprehensive set of actions any administration has taken to date to increase access to high quality childcare and long-term care and support for the caregivers. Under this order, almost every federal agency will collectively take over 50 actions to provide more peace of mind for families and dignity for care workers, who deserve jobs with good pay and good benefits.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:03)', 'Speech': 'The executive order doesn’t require any new spending. It’s about making sure taxpayers will get the best value for the investments they’ve already made. For example, we used last year’s increase in Head Start funding to take steps to recruit and retain workers by increasing wages so that families who need affordable care can get it. Like I called for in my State of the Union address, we’re going to improve long-term care by strengthening staffing standards at nursing homes and I also instructed the Department of Health and Human Services to figure out how home care workers can get the pay they deserve with the money already allocated.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:42)', 'Speech': 'I’m directing the VA, the Veteran Administration to cut red tape and give veterans who need assistance at home more flexibility to pick their own caregivers. We’ve heard directly from the veterans that this is one of the top priorities for them, one of their top priorities. To ensure we have enough care workers, we’re expanding partnerships with community colleges, registered apprenticeship programs, and the America Corp.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:14)', 'Speech': 'More than one in every five adults is a family caregiver. This order recognizes the labor of love and makes sure family caregivers are involved and informed when a hospital discharges the one they love, that the caregivers know about the Medicare benefits their loved one qualifies for, the caregivers of veterans have access to mental health support.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:39)', 'Speech': 'Folks, there’s a lot we can do. We’re doing all of this. Why? Because right now, the cost of care is too high for seniors in nursing homes, for working families with young children. Pay for care workers is too low and that’s why that so many are leaving the whole endeavor. In fact, half the long term care workforce, nearly 20% of childcare workforce leave their jobs each year, make it even harder, harder for families to find the help they need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:16)', 'Speech': 'And family members are too often forced to leave their own good jobs behind to stay home to be mom and dad. The United States of America, we should have no one, no one should have to choose between caring for the parents who raised them, the children who depend on them or the paycheck they rely on to take care of both.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:38)', 'Speech': 'Too many folks lie awake at night wondering if mom can’t take care of herself at home, what are we going to do? She’ll have to move into a nursing home. Are we going to be able to afford it? Can I still afford to get the kids through college and save for retirement? How do I do it all? If I take that better job with the better pay, longer hours, will I be able to take care of my kids or will it cost me more than I get the raise in the paycheck in the new job I’m about to have?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:05)', 'Speech': 'If you live in a major American city, you can pay more than $17,000 a year, as all of you know, per child, for childcare in order to be able to go to work. And for a lot of families, that’s more than you pay for your rent, your mortgage or your college education for your children. You can all imagine the young couple expecting their first child thinking they should be really excited, but instead they’re a little bit scared. They already need two paychecks to make ends meet now, or whether they’re going to be able to do it. They’re going to be able to do it, keep the job or are they going to be able to afford childcare when the baby comes?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:45)', 'Speech': 'Meanwhile, long-term care costs for the elderly or people with disabilities are up 40%. The costs are up 40% over the past decade. Some of you have had to spend your own retirement savings to care for your parents. Imagine dad lived in a house his whole life, but he can’t manage his own house anymore. He has trouble getting around. He needs [inaudible 00:09:11] to stay home, someone to just deliver the dinners, just to be able to shovel the sidewalk, et cetera, just to be able to stay where he was.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:20)', 'Speech': 'Who’s going to go tell dad? You probably had that conversation, some of you. Who’s going to tell dad you can’t stay in the house, can’t stay home anymore? You got to go to a nursing home. Millions of Americans are stuck in the middle, in part of so-called sandwich generation, caring for young children and not only parents at the same time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:41)', 'Speech': 'It’s overwhelming. I get it. I was a single parent for five years with two young children after my wife and daughter were killed in an accident. Thank God I had family to rely on. There’s a reason why, by the way, a lot of people don’t move beyond where their families are, even though they have other opportunities. They can’t afford to.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:03)', 'Speech': 'My sister, my brother, my brother-in-law, my mother, they all chipped in. My sister and husband gave up their home and moved in to where I lived just to be there to help me with my kids. Folks, I couldn’t have done it without their help. I couldn’t have made it. And I was making a good salary. I was making, I think we got paid $45,000 a year then. And that was more money than never made in my life. But I couldn’t possibly. That’s why I committed every single day for 36 years so I could be home because I couldn’t sell my home and get reelected without having a home in Delaware. Couldn’t move down here and afford it. But I had a big family. I had help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:44)', 'Speech': 'I often asked myself: What in God’s name would I have done? Not a joke, had I not have the family I had. Over the years, Jill and I took care of all four of our parents. Well, they didn’t have to take all four. One died suddenly. But my point is, we were with our parents till the very end. We could do it. We could afford to do it because where we were and we had the housing to be able to bring them in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:12)', 'Speech': 'We understand. In the pandemic, we made even clearer just how hard it is for millions of working and middle class families to provide care for their families. It’s not just how important the care economy is to the entire economy. It’s when people have to leave the labor force or can’t enter in the first place because caregiving responsibility. They can’t fully participate in the economy and that drags down the whole nation’s productivity and growth overall.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:42)', 'Speech': 'Care work is demanding, as many of you in this audience know. It requires serious skill. But these workers are among the lowest paid workers in the country. As soon as I got in office, I signed the American Rescue Plan to help millions of families afford childcare. The consequence were able to keep 200,000 childcare advisors and providers, many of them small, women owned businesses, keep their doors open during the pandemic, taking care of as many as 9.6 million children during the pandemic because of that act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:24)', 'Speech': 'One third of childcare providers said they would’ve to shut down for good without the help. Instead, the American Rescue Plan helped them stay afloat, and in many cases increased pay for the childcare workers. It also helped states expand and strengthen Medicaid home care programs. We also increased childcare and development block grants, helping more low-income families afford childcare.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:50)', 'Speech': 'We issued the first ever, a much needed, national strategy on support family caregivers. And that was Nancy, thank you. And received federal dollars through the CHIPS and Science Act, which I might point out has already generated $200 billion in investment in the United States commitments. Those companies are going to have to provide high quality, affordable childcare for their workers if they want to participate in the programs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:23)', 'Speech': 'We’re using the power of the federal government to get companies to do what’s good for their workers, and I might add good for business as well. Good for business as well. And folks, care workers deserve to make a decent living and that’s a fight I’m willing to have. We need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:46)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we know there’s more to do, and yet yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, went to Wall Street. He did not tell the wealthy or the powerful on Wall Street that it was finally time for them to start paying their fair share of taxes. That didn’t come up, other than saying they’re going to renew the $2 trillion tax cut. Anyway, I won’t… Instead, he proposed huge cuts to important programs that millions of Americans count on, million middle class, suburban as well as inner city folks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:26)', 'Speech': 'He threatened to become the first speaker to default on our national debt, which took over 230 years to accumulate. He threatened to be the first one to default on the debt, which would throw us in a gigantic recession and beyond, unless he gets what he wants on the budget. Folks, you’ve got to ask yourself, what are MAGA republicans in Congress doing? Because this is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a different deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:56)', 'Speech': 'The two presidents that warned most directly against playing with the national debt were Ronald Reagan. He spoke very, very passionately about that and he came forward. And anyway, I won’t… But why are they doing this? What’s the purpose? The speaker talked about limiting spending, which sounds good, and by the way, I was able to cut the deficit by $1.7 billion in two years. And if we pass the budget I’m proposing, we’ll lower the spending way beyond that just in the first… We’re going to lower the spending by $168 billion just because the way we’ve changed Medicare, I mean, excuse me, prescription drug costs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:41)', 'Speech': 'But let’s take a closer look at what he didn’t say. Critical programs for hardworking Americans, the ones they count on, will be slashed starting next year if he has his way. He didn’t tell you the leading house Republican proposal would cut all the programs in discretionary spending by 22%. It would mean higher cost for childcare, higher cost for preschool, higher cost for college. 200,000 children would lose access to Head Start slots and even more would lose access to childcare altogether.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:14)', 'Speech': 'It would mean higher costs for housing, especially for older Americans, for veterans, people with disabilities and families and children. Longer wait times for social security and Medicare benefits, robbing seniors of their healthy males. 30 million fewer veteran outpatient visits, leaving our brave warriors unable to get checkups, mental health services and treatment for substance abuse disorders.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:41)', 'Speech': 'Congress just passed the Pact Act, which I was very proud of, to help – it was bipartisan – to help veterans exposed to toxic burn pits like my son. These cuts will make it harder for us to meet that sacred obligation to protect those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they return home. They would deny tens of thousands of people suffering from opioid epidemic and addiction, the treatment they need for recovery.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:10)', 'Speech': 'They’re also planning other cuts as well. They’d cut 10 million people, including 4 million children, would lose food assistance programs. Changes to Medicaid would also cause millions of people to lose their healthcare. And now, what the speaker didn’t tell you, is the MAGA Republicans in Congress are still supporting over $3 trillion in tax giveaways overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations. I might add, we have now about a thousand billionaires. You know what the average tax rate is? Three, T-H-R-E-E, percent. 3%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:52)', 'Speech': 'And their cuts to those critical programs I talked about won’t go to reduce the deficit after all. They just pay for the rest of the MAGA Republican agenda: massive tax cuts, giveaways to gear up for the rich and large corporations who acknowledge they don’t need them all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:07)', 'Speech': 'Folks, if MAGA Republicans in Congress won’t ask the wealthy or big corporations to pay a dollar more in taxes, but they’ll make a 22% cut to programs across the board like education, scientific research, basic services people rely on, then they should tell the American people what that means and why they’re doing it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:28)', 'Speech': 'It means they want to go back to the same old trickle down economic theories of the past while we, the economy, have been growing from the middle out and the bottom up is sidelined. Instead of investing in kids and cutting taxes for families with children, MAGA Republicans in Congress support more than $3 trillion in tax cuts and giveaways over the next 10 years toward those at the very top of the agenda, on the income agenda.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:57)', 'Speech': 'On the other hand, as I said, in my first two years, we brought down the deficit by a record $1.7 trillion. And my budgets I proposed, which I’ve laid out, would cut the deficit over the next 10 years by another $3 trillion. So I urge Congress to take the threat of default off the table. Pass my budget. If you don’t pass it, at least argue with what they don’t like about it, let’s vote on it. But in the meantime, we’re not waiting around. That’s what today’s all about.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:29)', 'Speech': 'Let me conclude with this. The actions we’re taking today are about dignity, security, and peace of mind for working families and caregivers all across the country, and they’re good for the economy as well. When I ran for president to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class, to grow our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Two years in, we’re making progress, so let’s finish the job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:59)', 'Speech': 'I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s virtually nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together and I mean it, nothing, if we work together. So may God bless you all. May God bless our caregivers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:20)', 'Speech': 'Now I’m going to go over and sign that executive order. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:22)', 'Speech': 'Good to see you, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:25)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:25)', 'Speech': 'All right. We got everybody? All right. I’m about to sign an executive order increasing access to high quality care and supporting caregivers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:31)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:21:35], I’m not sure where the line is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:43)', 'Speech': 'There you go.'}]"

Emphasize, does not default on its debt for the first time in history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:26)', 'Speech': 'I’m pleased, but not surprised to hear, Republican minority leader of the United States Senate saying that at our meeting that the United States is not going to default, never has and it never will. He’s absolutely correct. We agree to continue our discussions and we’re going to meet again on Friday.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:47)', 'Speech': 'In the meantime, our staffs were going to meet today, and daily, between now and then, and everyone in the meeting understood the risk of default. Our economy would fall into a significant recession. It would devastate retirement accounts, increase borrowing costs. According to Moody’s, nearly 8 million Americans would lose their jobs and our international reputation would be damaged in the extreme. The last part is me, international, Moody’s did not say the last part about damage in the extreme.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:20)', 'Speech': 'I made clear during our meeting that default is not an option. Repeated that time and again. America is not a deadbeat nation. We pay our bills and avoiding default is a basic duty of the United States Congress.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:35)', 'Speech': 'In fact, they did it three times under my predecessor without once, not one time, creating a crisis, rattling the markets, or undermining the unshakeable trust the world has in America’s commitment to paying its bills. And I’ll remind you, the national debt went up 40% over the 200 year… Went up 40% under my predecessor. And that’s the problem we’re dealing with today. I might note parenthetically, in my first two years I reduced the debt by $1.7 trillion. No president’s ever done that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:08)', 'Speech': 'I told congressional leaders that I’m prepared to begin a separate discussion about my budget and the spending priorities, but not under the threat of default. As I said, I’ve already cut the deficit by 1.7 trillion in my first two years in office. And the budget just submitted to Congress, cuts another $3 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. My budget that I submitted.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:33)', 'Speech': 'I made it clear that we can cut spending and cut the deficit. For example, my budget cuts $200 billion in spending by strengthening Medicare’s power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. In addition, that’s on top of the $160 billion in budget savings we passed last year, by being able to reduce the price of insulin and other drugs for those on Medicare.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:00)', 'Speech': 'And my budget cuts 30 billion, 30 billion, in spending on tax subsidies for big oil companies. They made $200 billion. They don’t need a $30 billion subsidy to drill. It makes no sense. Why are we handing them a $30 billion tax subsidy? And you know it’s time to stop doing that. And that’s what my budget does, among other things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:25)', 'Speech': 'My budget also funds the internal revenue code so that there’s enough agents to thoroughly look at the taxes of billionaires in America. This congressional budget office says it would raise $200 billion. Larry Summers, the former secretary, says it’ll raise twice that amount. It’ll raise a lot of money. Why do they want to get rid of the people who in fact would be able to do those audits?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:51)', 'Speech': 'And my budget has some of the strongest anti-fraud proposals ever proposed. It strengthens the number of inspector generals. Remember, I know some of you covered me with my arguments in the past, with the last administration, for cutting inspector generals as to how the money was being spent. And inspector generals are watchdogs for taxpayers dollars and it’s estimated that we’d save $10 for every dollar spent on funding the inspector generals. My budget cuts wasteful spending, closes loopholes and does one more thing, it makes the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations to begin to just start to pay some of the fair share, just some of the fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:31)', 'Speech': 'Speaker McCarthy offered a very different way forward. He’s proposed deep cuts that I believe are going to hurt American families. Millions of Americans relying on Medicaid for their healthcare would be at risk of losing that. And there would be 30 million fewer outpatient visits for veterans to the VA hospitals. And we just increased the VA budget so they can accommodate seeing these folks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:54)', 'Speech': 'And we’d have to cut 30,000 law enforcement agents, FBI, DEA, Border Patrol. A hundred thousand teachers and support personnel would lose their jobs. And all of that would hurt Americans and leave folks behind. Look, now I know the speaker says, well, I’m not… He uses the, L-word, the lying word… But says I’m not telling the truth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:18)', 'Speech': 'All I asked him inside was, if you’re not going to cut any of those programs and you’re saying the cut is 22% across the board, then you’re going to have to cut a hell of a lot more with the programs that are left. “No, we’re not going to do that either.” I’m not sure. I don’t think they’re sure exactly what they’re proposing. And if House Republicans take cuts in defense off the table, the cuts they have to make to other programs will be even deeper than that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:45)', 'Speech': 'And one last thing, that’s very important. The speaker is saying he’s been trying to get me to sit down with him for 97 days. 97 days ago we did meet in my office. I said to him at the time, “I’m happy to talk. You submit your budget, I’ll submit mine and we’ll talk about it.” And I don’t want to get any press person, point anybody up, but I think you all remember my saying that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:11)', 'Speech': 'I submitted my budget on March the 9th in detail. He passed his plan, I think, in the last or second of last week in April. Five days later, after he finally put forward something, I called on him to invite him to a meeting with the other leading members of the Congress.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:28)', 'Speech': 'Look, over these last few days and weeks, there’s going to be… there’s a lot of politics, posturing and gamesmanship and it’s going to continue for a while. But I am squarely focused on what matters and we’re getting to work. As I’ve said all along, let’s discuss what we need to cut, what we need to protect, what new revenue we can raise, and how to lower the deficit to put our fiscal house in order. But in the meantime, in the meantime, we need to take the thread of default off the table.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:00)', 'Speech': 'As the meeting ended, I suggested we continue to meet and our staffs continue to meet, and the leaders meet again on Friday to continue our discussions to see what progress we made. So let me end where I began. This nation is never defaulted on its debt. It never will. Thank you. And now I’ll take your questions. Yes ma’am.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:39)', 'Speech': 'You all saw, one of you probably wrote the article in today’s New York Times, about Texas. They’re making significant progress on solar and wind and renewable energy and hydrogen. And guess what? They want to cut it. You know why? I don’t think it’s anything to do with anything other than the oil companies don’t like it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:20)', 'Speech': 'And as an example, as I raised in the meeting, when they said, well, we’re going to cut and no spending more money. So what the hell happens if you cut, you’re going to cut people at the border, you’re going to cut agents at the border? We need more at the border, not less at the border.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:38)', 'Speech': 'Folks, thank you very, very much. I appreciate your time and I’m sure we’re going to be talking more about this. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:44)', 'Speech': 'Now the cameraman wants to go on. Thank you very much.'}]"

I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects 200 billion in excess payments for pharmaceutical industries and refusing to count that while cutting over a hundred thousand school teachers and assistant’s jobs. 30,000 law enforcement officers jobs cut across the entire United States of America. I’m not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax sheets and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly 1 million Americans. It’s time for Republicans to accept that there is no bipartisan deal to be made solely on their partisan terms. They have to move, as well. All four congressional leaders agree with me that default is not, let me say it again, default is not an option. I expect each of these leaders, excuse me, to live up to that commitment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:15)', 'Speech': 'America has never defaulted on our debt and it never will. The speaker and I’ll be talking later on the plane as we head back because it’s what, five or six, seven o’clock in the morning there. Our teams are going to continue working. Now, we’ve had a packed few days here in Hiroshima and I think with very productive important meetings at the G7 Summit. We also held the quad meeting here in Hiroshima rather than Australia and important bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, as well as the Prime Minister of India. This is my third trip to the Indo-Pacific as President and I look forward to rescheduling my stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia later. I’ve spoken with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and Secretary Blinken is traveling there to meet with the Pacific Island partners at that moment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:17)', 'Speech': 'I’m also going to be hosting, and I’ve spoken with the Prime Minister, hosting the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum in Washington this fall because I’m unable to make it to Papua New Guinea. Prime Minister Albanese, we’re going to have a state visit later this year. And I also want to thank President Kishida for his outstanding, it’s not hyperbole, his outstanding leadership of the G7 this year, as well as Mrs. Kishida and the entire Japanese government for the hospitality they’ve shown to Jill, myself, and our whole team. Being in this city and visiting the memorial on Friday was a powerful reminder of the devastating reality of nuclear war and our shared responsibility to never cease our efforts to build for peace. Together with the leaders of the G7, we have reiterated our commitment to continue to work toward a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:16)', 'Speech': 'Now, the past few days have showcased the unity of purpose among the G seven. It’s a very different organization than it was 5, 7, 10 years ago because we’re addressing the challenges that matter most to the world. We’re unit in our efforts to strengthen global health security. Yesterday announced that the United States plans to contribute another 250 million to the pandemic fund at the World Bank to make sure the world is better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics. We’re united in our commitment to climate action and accelerating the transition to a global clean energy economy by investing in the industries of the future. We’re united in our push to build a more resilient and inclusive global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we’ve experienced over the last few years, including by building a more secure and more diversified supply chain.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:13)', 'Speech': 'Through the partnership for global infrastructure and investment, which we launched last year at the G7 Summit in Germany, we’ve addressed the infrastructure needs that are holding back too many low and modern income countries, particularly in the global south. The United States has already mobilized more than 30 billion in PGII projects around the globe, a significant step toward our collective pledge of the G7 to mobilize 600 billion in investment by 2027. We resolved to reform the multilateral development banks to begin the more flexibility and better able to fight poverty by helping respond to global challenges. Now, we’re also united in our approach to The People’s Republic of China. The joint statement released yesterday outlines the shared principles we’ve all agreed to at the G7 and beyond dealing with China. We’re not looking to decouple from China. We’re looking to de-risk and diversify our relationship with China.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:18)', 'Speech': 'That means taking steps to diversify our supply chains so we’re not dependent on any one country for necessary product. It means resisting economic coercion together, and countering harmful practices that hurt our workers. It means protecting a narrow set of advanced technologies critical for our national security. Those elements are all agreed on by the G7. Finally, joined here in Hiroshima by President Zelenskyy and the G7 reaffirmed our shared and unwavering, let me say it again. Our shared and unwavering commitment to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia’s brutal war of aggression and the war crimes being committed. Together with our partner countries, we reiterated a need for a just peace that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, both core principles of the UN charter. Russia started this war, and Russia could end it today by withdrawing it’s troops from Ukraine internationally recognized borders and ceasing its assault.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:26)', 'Speech': 'Until then, excuse me. Ukraine’s ability to defend itself is essential to being able to end this war permanently and through diplomacy. This morning I once more shared and assured President Zelenskyy together with all G7 members and our allies and partners around the world that we will not waiver. Putin will not break our resolve as he thought he could two years ago, almost three years ago. We’re going to continue to provide economic, humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine so it can stand strong as long as it needs it. Today the United States announced our latest tranche of artillery, ammunition and anti-tank weapons and bridging equipment to help Ukraine succeed in the battlefield. In my private meeting with President Zelenskyy after the G7 meeting and with his staff, I told him the United States together with our allies and partners is going to begin training Ukrainian pilots in fourth generation fighter aircraft, including F16s to strengthen Ukraine’s Air Force as part of a long-term commitment to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:35)', 'Speech': 'We provided the last year all that they needed to deal with what they were dealing with at the moment, and now we’re moving in the direction of putting them in a position to be able to defend themselves in ways beyond what they’ve had to deal with so far. The past few days have once more underscored how important America’s global leadership is, a presumptuous thing for an American president to say, but I think you’ll find if you ask any of our colleagues, it’s true.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:04)', 'Speech': 'The security and prosperity of the American people are substantially increased by working in concert with our closest allies and partners to build a future of greater economic strength and resilience and a world that is more peaceful and stable. On many of these issues that matter to the American people, accelerating our clean energy transition, preventing another pandemic, dealing with China, standing up for Ukraine, the meetings I’ve had with my fellow G7 leaders have left us more united, more resolved, and more determined to set up for the greater progress in the months of ahead, and this has been an extremely significant and important summit. With that, I’m going to take some questions and Trevor of Reuters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:51)', 'Speech': 'And secondly, we’re in a situation where the… Let me put it this way: if you all were doing your budget at home and you said, “Okay, we have to make some cuts,” would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income, what was coming in the door to determine what you could afford? And so part of what I’ve been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as cutting spending.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:25)', 'Speech': 'I’m willing to cut spending and I propose cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars, but I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut, that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration, the fact that we’ve provided for the number, we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties, that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America. Very complicated stuff. It’s estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between, we would generate somewhere between, $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue, and there’s a lot of other…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:29)', 'Speech': 'For example, I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill anyway. I was able to cut by $1.7 billion in the first two years the deficit that we were accumulating. And because I was able to say too that the 55 corporations in America that made $ 400 billion, that they paid zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, “You’ve got to pay a minimum of 15% taxes.” What a horrible thing. You’re paying more than 15% in taxes, every one of you out there. And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget. We were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:26)', 'Speech': 'There’s a lot of things that they refused to look at in terms of tax generation, as well as what kind of people we’re going to increase taxes for. And like I said, we’re now down to… We went from roughly 740 billionaires to about 1000 billionaires in America. They’re paying an average tax rate of 8%. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8% only. I think you’d all be ready to do that. My point is that there’s a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said, “Revenue is off the table.” Well, revenue is not off the table, and so that’s what we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:51)', 'Speech': 'Look, here’s the other thing. I’m sure… I’m not sure, my guess is… I’ll get a question about, “Well, wait a minute. The American people aren’t satisfied.” Well, guess what? As I told you all before, most of this, what we passed, doesn’t kick in. It only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you’re in a situation where you were… I’ll give you the one example that I’ve used, everybody understands the easiest, is insulin. Well, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world; and that’s what we do, by the way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:31)', 'Speech': 'Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home. So we set a simple proposition: let’s take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I’m not going to ask you to show hands like you do in a town meeting, but if I usually ask, “How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes?” and almost at least half the audience raises their hand. Well, they were paying somewhere between $400 and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10… T-E-N, $10… to make, to package. Total amount you could argue maybe as much as $13. Well, guess what? Now they can’t charge more… Medicare can’t, because Medicare is taking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly’s healthcare needs… you can’t charge more than $35 for that drug. That saved $160 billion. $160 billion less will be paid out by the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:53)', 'Speech': 'Well, why isn’t this kicking in? We’re in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to pay total cost. Total cost of all the drugs… from expensive cancer drugs, to whatever drugs they’re taking… will not have to pay more than $3500 a year, the following year. We’ve already passed it. This is a law now. The following year they want to pay more than $2000. That saved another $200 billion that we’re paying out, but the other team won’t count this. Even though it’s a law and we passed it, they won’t count that as reducing the debt. There’s a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:31)', 'Speech': 'And my guess is that I’m going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it’ll be morning time over at home, and I’m going to be in that plane in about an hour or so. My guess is he’s going to want to deal directly with me and making sure we’re all on the same page, but that’s probably more than you wanted to know.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:58)', 'Speech': 'How about [inaudible 00:18:02], NHK?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:19)', 'Speech': 'But in the meantime, what’s happened is I think it’s fair to say, for those of you who have dealt with the Japanese government, and reported from here for a long time, the situation in terms of our relationship with Japan have never, ever, ever in American history been stronger. Never. And we started this relationship when I came to see some of you with me by my first trip here when I came to see President Kishida’s predecessor, and made the case that what was happening in Europe was the world is getting smaller. What’s happened in Europe and the invasion of Ukraine'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:55)', 'Speech': 'And so we’re sticking by that. We’re not going to tell China what they can do. We made it clear that we don’t expect Taiwan to independently declare independence either. But in the meantime, we’re going to continue to put Taiwan in a position that they can defend themselves. And there is clear understanding among most of our allies that in fact, if China were to act unilaterally, there would be a response. There would be a response.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:24)', 'Speech': 'But, so I don’t think there’s anything inevitable about the notion that there’s going to be this conflict between the United States and the West and/or Japan and Korea and the Quad.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:38)', 'Speech': 'And if you take a look at what’s happened, we are more secure with all the talk about China’s building its military. And it is building its military. And that’s why I have made it clear that I’m not prepared to trade certain items with China. And when I was asked by President Xi, “Why?” I said, “Because you’re using it to build nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and I’m not going to do it.” And we’ve now got commitment from all of our allies, they’re not going to either provide that kind of material that allows them to do that. But that’s not a hostile act. That’s an act that says we’re going to make sure that we do everything we can to maintain the status quo ante.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:18)', 'Speech': 'And what’s going on now is, look at the meeting we had here today and yesterday of the Quad. I bet you… Maybe some of you thought it, but I doubt many people in this audience, or any other audience, would’ve said that two years after being elected, I’d be able to convince India, Australia, Japan, and the United States to form an organization called the Quad, to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:50)', 'Speech': 'Well, when asked by President Xi why we were doing that, I said, simple. We have an international organizations have agreed upon what constitutes open airspace and sea space. And we’re not going to allow that to be unilaterally altered, period. We’re not changing any rules. We’re just making sure that we unite democracies in the conviction that the Pacific Basin remains what it was before, open and clear.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:21)', 'Speech': 'So I guess what I’m saying is… I don’t guess what I’m saying… What I’m trying to say is, I think we’re more united than we’ve ever been, ever been, in the Pacific in terms of maintaining stability and maintaining a sense of security.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:39)', 'Speech': 'So I’m not sure if that answers your question, but I hope it does. If it doesn’t, do you want to follow up with any portion of that question?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:48)', 'Speech': 'Initially, if you remember, when the Republicans introduced their, when the speaker, by I guess a four or five vote majority, was able to pass his, what he calls, extending the debt with a limitation on what you had to do to extend it in terms of the budget side. I said, I’m not going to negotiate on whether to extend the debt, I will negotiate on a budget.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:13)', 'Speech': 'On the budget side of the equation, they came along and said initially… It’s hard to determine where they are, quite frankly. And I don’t know, you all may know more from questioning than I do… But they came along and said, we’re going to move off of the 2023 budget, and that’s the baseline we’re going to use for the next two years, that budget.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:35)', 'Speech': 'And I said, “Well, what about what you all just voted on after the budget, which was the add-on money that you all agreed to and the House and Senate voted for?” And they said, “Well, that includes that as well.” I said, “Okay, well then we may be able to work on something.” So we started calculating what that would mean in terms of a… it came to a 22% cut for everything in the budget, but the things that have already been passed, the five big initiatives that I’ve already passed in terms of infrastructure, the Affordable Care Act, et cetera.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:10)', 'Speech': 'But in the meantime, what happened is that that seems to be changing. They said, “Well, we’re going to exempt… ” Remember we said that, well, you’re going to cut veterans because 20 of you said everything, the discretionary… Say, “No, we’re not going to cut veterans.” Okay, that’s good. And initially, they started off, they’re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid. I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, I mean not Medicaid, social security and Medicare. They said, no, no, no, no. First time I ever had a negotiation in a State of the Union message. But they said, no, we’re not going to cut that. Okay, well that’s off the radar.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:46)', 'Speech': 'What else is off the radar? And they named some other things. And I said, “Well, that means if you want to get the number, you wanted from freezing the budget at 2023 plus the additions you added, then that means you’re going to go from 22%, you’re going to end up cutting 30% or 35% discretionary budget.” For example, if you calculate what they’re talking about, they’re going to lose a hundred thousand teachers in assistance. They’re going to lose thousands of police officers across the board. I mean, just calculate what it means if you take all discretionary spending and you make no distinctions other than what the percentage number of the cut is. And some of it makes absolutely no sense at all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:27)', 'Speech': 'And so what we’ve done is, we’re going to have to sit down. I’m hoping that Speaker McCarthy is just waiting to negotiate with me when I get home, which has been… I don’t know whether that’s true or not, we’ll find out. But at first we weren’t making progress. Then we made a lot of progress, and then all of a sudden they came back with a proposal that was very cut back from where they had agreed or discussed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:54)', 'Speech': 'And now, I don’t know. We gave a counter proposal to the counter, again, I know this sounds ridiculous, but that’s what we did. And I’m waiting to hear the response to what we have offered. We are willing to cut spending as well as raise revenue so people start paying their fair share. Again, if this is [inaudible 00:28:17] and ask, raise your hand if you think the tax structure is fair, remotely fair, what do you think? Anyway, so that’s the context.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:50)', 'Speech': 'Jim Tankersley, New York Times.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:47)', 'Speech': 'Number three, I can’t guarantee that they wouldn’t force a default by doing something outrageous. I can’t guarantee that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:44)', 'Speech': 'So having said that, the expectation and hope is that they will be successful and that it’ll make it clear to Russia that the cost… For example, Bahkmut. Bahkmut is a discussion about whether or not it’s been lost or whatever. And well, the truth of the matter is, the Russians have suffered over a hundred thousand casualties in Bahkmut. It’s hard to make up. It’s hard to make up. So whether or not there are troops in Bahkmut occupying, there’s not many buildings left standing in Bahkmut. It’s a pretty devastated city. But they have been able to move in a direction that they’ve been able to lock down an awful lot of the Russian forces, including the Wagner group. So with regard to the F-16s, F-16s would not have helped in that regard at all. It was unnecessary. For example, let’s take this, Bahkmut, for example, would not have any additional added consequence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:50)', 'Speech': 'But what’s happened is since the provision of everything from the significant missile defense systems, tanks, sophisticated tanks, and all the things that were of consequence in the near term in the Donbas area and where the fighting was taking place, they now have all that equipment. There’s a little bit still coming, but have all that equipment. What’s going to happen though is if they continue to do well, they’re going to be in a situation where you’re going to have the Russians being able to stand off at a greater distance from maintaining their headquarters and other things which are out of range of the existing capacity they have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:36)', 'Speech': 'And they have to be able to be in a position where now those fighter jets, those F-16s, make a big difference in terms of being able to deal with what is coming down the road. And, God willing, and we don’t know this, if they’re successful and there ends up being an accommodation where there is not decease fire, but there is a peace agreement that gets worked out, that they’ll have the capacity to have confidence in their ability to resist response by the Russians if they were to change their position. So that’s the essence of the difference. Was there another part of the question?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:49)', 'Speech': '[Inaudible 00:37:54] unilateral action?'}]"

I’ve signed more than 350 bipartisan laws thus far in almost two and a half years, including the historic law that rebuilding America so that we can rank number one in the world in infrastructure instead of where we’re ranked now, number 13 in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:46)', 'Speech': 'Another historic law, rebuilding our manufacturing base so that we’ll lead the world once again in making semiconductor chips so many more, and so many sophisticated ones. And now, a bipartisan budget agreement. This is vital because it’s essential to the progress we’ve made over the last few years is keeping full faith and credit of the United States of America and passing a budget that continues to grow our economy and reflects our values as a nation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:17)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I’m speaking tonight, to report on the crisis of verdict and what we’re doing to protect America’s future. Passing this budget agreement was critical. The stakes could not have been higher. If we had failed to reach an agreement on the budget, there were extreme voices threatening to take America for the first time in our 247 year history, into default on our national debt. Nothing. Nothing would’ve been more irresponsible. Nothing would’ve been more catastrophic. Our economy would’ve been thrown into recession. Retirement accounts for millions of Americans would’ve been decimated.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:56)', 'Speech': '8 million Americans would’ve lost their jobs. Default have destroyed our nation’s credit rating, which would’ve made everything from mortgages to car loans to funding for the government much more expensive. And it would’ve taken years to climb out of that hole, and America standing as the most trusted, reliable financial partner in the world would’ve been shattered.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:19)', 'Speech': 'So it was critical to reach an agreement, and it’s very good news for the American people. No one got everything they wanted, but the American people got what they needed. We averted an economic crisis, an economic collapse. We’re cutting spending and bringing the deficits down at the same time. We’re protecting important priorities from social security to Medicare, to Medicaid, to veterans, to our transformational investments in infrastructure and clean energy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:49)', 'Speech': 'I want to commend Speaker McCarthy. You know, he and I, and our teams, we were able to get along, get things done. We were straightforward with one another, completely honest with one another, respectful with one another. Both sides operated in good faith. Both sides kept their word. And I also want to command other congressional leaders, House Minority Leader Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Minority Leader McConnell. They acted responsibly and put the good of the country ahead of politics.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:23)', 'Speech': 'The final vote in both chambers was overwhelming, far more bipartisan than anyone thought was possible. So I want to thank the members of Congress who voted to pass this agreement, which I’m going to sign tomorrow and become the law.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:37)', 'Speech': 'So here’s what the deal does. First, it cuts spending. And over the next 10 years, the deficit will be cut by more than $1 trillion, and that’ll be on top of the record $1.7 trillion. I already cut the deficit in my first two years in office. And it’s clear, we’re all in a much more fiscally responsible course than the one I inherited when I took office four years ago. When I came to office, the deficit had increased every year, the previous four years, and nearly $8 trillion added to the national debt in the last administration. And now we’re turning things around and that’s good for America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:19)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, I’ll tell you what you value.” That’s at the heart of this debate, what do we value?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:30)', 'Speech': 'Protecting seniors. You may remember during my State of the Union address, there were spirited exchange between me and a few Republicans spontaneously occurring on the floor of the House of Representatives. I was pointing out that for years, some of them were putting forward proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare. And some of them that night took exceptions and they said very loudly that that wasn’t true.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:55)', 'Speech': 'So I asked them on the floor at that night. Asked them a simple question, will you agree not to cut Social Security and not to cut Medicare? Would they agree to protect these essential programs that are a lifeline for millions of Americans? Programs that these Americans have been paying into every single paycheck they’ve earned since they started working and that provides so much peace of mind. With the bright lights and cameras on those, few Republicans who were protesting, they agreed, they said they wouldn’t cut it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:27)', 'Speech': 'That’s how we protected Social Security and Medicare from the beginning and from it being cut, period. Healthcare was another priority for me, a top priority. I made it clear from the outset I would not agree to any cuts in Medicaid, another essential lifeline for millions of Americans including children in poverty, the elderly in nursing homes and Americans living with disabilities. The original House Republican proposal would’ve cut healthcare for up to 21 million Americans on Medicaid, and I said, no. And Medicare was protected, and so were millions of people most in need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:04)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’ve long believed that the only one truly sacred obligation that the government has is to prepare those we send in the harms way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don’t come home. That’s why my last budget provided VA hospitals with additional funding for more doctors, nurses, and equipment to accommodate the needs of veterans and more appointments.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:31)', 'Speech': 'The House Republican plan would’ve met 30 fewer million VA healthcare visits for our veterans. But we didn’t let that happen. In addition, this bill fully funds the bipartisan PACT Act, the most significant law in decades for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and for their families. It expands access to those veterans and their families to healthcare and to disability benefits.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:00)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re investing in America and in our people and in our future. We’ve created over 13 million new jobs, nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Where is it written that America can’t lead the world again in manufacturing? Unemployment is at 3.7%. More Americans are working today than ever in the history of this country, and inflation has dropped 10 straight months in a row. In this debate, I refused to put what was responsible for all this economic progress on the chopping block. This bipartisan agreement protects the law that will help us build the best infrastructure in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:40)', 'Speech': 'It fully protects the CHIPS and Science Act, which is going to bring key parts of our supply chain to America so we don’t have to rely on others. Like semiconductors, those tiny computer chips smaller than the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything we rely on from cell phones to building automobiles to the most sophisticated weapon system and so much more. We protected another law that I passed and signed last year that finally beat Big Pharma, which I’ve been trying to do for over 30 years. It finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices, just like the VA’s been able to do for veterans.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:20)', 'Speech': 'This law hass already dramatically cut the cost of insulin for seniors from as much as $400 a month to just $35 a month for insulin. Negotiating lower drug prices not only saves seniors a lot of money, it saves the country a lot of money. $160 billion, that’s not having to be paid out because we have drug prices that are more rational. We pay the highest drug prices of any industrial nation in the world, and it’s just the beginning.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:50)', 'Speech': 'We also protected the most significant breakthrough ever, ever in dealing with existential threat of climate change. Today, new wind and solar power is cheaper than fossil fuel. Since I’ve been in office, clean energy and advanced manufacturing have brought in $470 billion in private investments. It’s going to create thousands of jobs, good paying jobs all across this country and help the environment at the same time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:22)', 'Speech': 'Remember at the beginning of this debate, some of my Republican colleagues were determined and go gut the clean energy investments. I said no, we kept them all. And there’s so much more to do. We’re going to do even more to reduce the deficit. We need to control spending if we’re going to do that. But we also have to raise revenue and go after tax sheets and make sure everybody’s paying their fair share. No one, I promise, no one making less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes. But like most of you at home, I know the federal tax system isn’t fair. That’s why I kept my commitment again, that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in federal taxes. That’s why last year I secured more IRS funding to go after wealthy tax cheats.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:14)', 'Speech': 'The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, and it is non-partisan, says that this bill will bring in $150 billion and other outside experts expect that it would save as much as $400 billion because it’s forcing people to pay their fair share. Republicans may not like it, but I’m going to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:37)', 'Speech': 'I’m also proposed to closing over a dozen special interest tax loopholes for big oil, crypto traders, hedge fund billionaires, saving taxpayers billions of dollars. Republicans defended every single one of these special interest loopholes, every single one. But I’m going to be coming back and with your help, I’m going to win. Right now… catch this, right now the average billionaire in America pays just 8% in federal taxes. 8%. Teachers and firefighters pay more than that. That’s why I proposed the minimum tax for billionaires.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:17)', 'Speech': 'Republicans are against it, but I’m going to keep fighting for it. No billionaires should pay less in federal taxes than a teacher or a firefighter. Look, let me close with this. I know bipartisanship is hard and unity is hard, but we can never stop trying because the moments like this one, the ones we just faced, where the American economy and the world economy is at risk of collapsing, there’s no other way. No matter how tough our politics gets, we need to see each other’s not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Treat each other with dignity and respect. To join forces as Americans, to stop shouting, lower the temperature and work together to pursue progress, secure prosperity, and keep the promise of America for everybody.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:10)', 'Speech': 'As I’ve said in my inaugural address, without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury, and we can never become that country. I I can honestly say to you tonight that I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just need to remember who we are, we are the United States of America, and there’s nothing, nothing we can’t do when we do it together. So thank you all for listening. Taking the time tonight to listen to me. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

One of the reasons I’m so incredibly optimistic, this is the best educated, most committed generation in American history and they’re going to take us over the… Just work it out for us. Many of you have been with me throughout my career and I can’t tell you how much it means to have your support again. I was just saying to Carol Braun that we’ve known each other a little while. She was 12 when she got started. I was a little older. And that there’s an old expression we joke, in the neighborhood I grew up in, “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:40)', 'Speech': 'You all brought me to the dance a long time ago when I got started, and thanks in particular to the League of Conservations for hosting us tonight. And thank you all for your leadership and so many important issues over the years. By the way, there’s a lot of threats our children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren are going to face. This is the only truly existential threat. It’s the existential threat. If we don’t meet the requirements that we’re looking at, we’re in real trouble. Your work has never been more important than it is today. Together, we’ve made a lot of progress so far, but we got to finish the job. We got to finish the job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:23)', 'Speech': 'And I’m glad to be here to take part in a tribute to my friend Nancy Pelosi and she is my friend. I honestly believe Nancy’s going to go down to history as one of the most consequential speakers in American history, and that’s a fact. Nancy led the way. You would never have to worry when she was leading about whether or not she’d pass the bill. She told you how many votes she had and she had the exact number she’d tell you. That was really nice. She was right every time. We worked together a long time. She had the votes for so many life-changing pieces of legislation, including historic legislation to combat the existential threat of climate change. Folks, last week millions of Americans sheltered indoors and wore masks outside as they watched the haze, a yellow haze. My granddaughter and my daughter were up in New York and they were taking a picture from my granddaughter’s apartment and you couldn’t see a block away.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:16)', 'Speech': 'You couldn’t see the buildings, the pictures they showed me. That haze settled over our homes in our neighborhoods and it was a new experience for many Americans already the norm for communities across the Western States. Last year, I, with the EPA and others, traveled in helicopter, all the fires that were out west and I looked down, I saw more timber burn to the ground than the entire state of Maryland. Not the timber, if you took a map of Maryland, every single part of that state, that’s how much burned to the ground. The hurricanes and other extreme weather caused $165 billion of damage. We still have people wondering whether there’s a climate change crisis. Over the past two years a third of Americans have been personally affected by extreme weather events. One third. Folks, this is what climate change look like. Only it looks worse if we don’t do something now, but I don’t have to tell you it’s not inevitable. It is not inevitable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:27)', 'Speech': 'With your help, we’re doing something about it by reclaiming our leadership on the world stage. The leadership, the members of Congress, and all of you have made the largest investment in climate, environmental justice and conservation ever, anywhere in the entire world. And by the way, if you don’t mind my asking, would all the members of Congress please stand? All the members that are here. Well, let me tell you, Inflation Reduction Act, includes $369 billion to combat climate change. And from day one, we’ve been working to reduce our carbon emissions. Thanks to the historic law, by the year 2030, we’ll be reducing emissions on a yearly basis by 1 billion tons a year. 1 billion tons a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:30)', 'Speech': 'The law includes tax credits are going to create tens of thousands of good paying jobs, clean energy, manufacturing jobs. And if I could divert for just a second, some of you were concerned because I’d been so deeply involved in the environmental movement with the folks here. What happened was I didn’t announce my environmental plan for the first month after I announced and everybody wondered why. Because I said then I was convinced I could bring labor along. Guess what? Labor is with us. Organized labor, unions are with us. They’re supporting us, particularly the IBEW. It’s already attracting billions of dollars in private sector investment. Even in districts that in fact, you wouldn’t expect. Districts that are all over the map and then it’s already attracting that money. Where members of Congress voted against the bill, we’re still having.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:29)', 'Speech': 'I made a commitment. I said, like I said to all my folks, all the Americans in the State of the Union address, “I promise to be president for all the people.” So I’ll see them on at the groundbreaking, all these folks, all of them, even the ones who voted against it. You think, I’m kidding. You all think I’m kidding. I’m not. At solar factories in the Midwest and the South, wind farms across the plains, off our shores. Electric vehicle plants, clean steel and clean cement projects and so much more all across America. Working families can save thousands of dollars a year on energy costs, including rebates to weatherize their home tax credits for electric heat pumps, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, new and used. It’s a big deal. It’s really starting to have an impact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:20)', 'Speech': 'We’re focusing on communities that have been denied basic security and basic dignity that comes with clean air, clean water and clean energy jobs. And that had been denied environmental justice. I signed an executive order to make environmental justice the responsibility of every single federal department in the United States government, for real. And I made an historic pledge to direct 40% of all the benefits from these federal investments in climate change and clean energy, to communities that have been left behind for much too long. With your support, we’re living up to that pledge. It’s called my Justice40 Initiative, making the biggest investments ever in frontline, fence line communities, that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:13)', 'Speech': 'We’re replacing every single lead pipe in America. We’re cleaning up old industry sites. We’re including brownfields and Superfund sites, and the blight of communities that are there for decades, that have been just clobbered all across Appalachia, the Southwest. We’re plugging abandoned wells, gas and oil wells that leaked methane and dangerous gases, creating jobs, paying the same amount of money those workers that dug the wells in the first place to cap those wells. We’re helping school districts across the country electrify their school buses so kids don’t have to breathe the polluted air from diesel exhausts. We’re doing the same for the cities and towns and just today the Treasury Department issued guidance. So for the first time, local communities including churches, nonprofits, can take advantage of the clean energy tax credits that are coming. Cleaner air and cost savings to every corner of America. We’re also taking historic action to preserve our country’s land and water. My first week in office, I issued the executive order established in the country’s first ever national conservation goal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:30)', 'Speech': 'We called it America the Beautiful, and it’s a nationwide campaign to conserve, by 2030, at least 30% of the lands waters that support and sustain our nation. 30% and we’re getting it done. Anybody from Colorado here? Camp Hale, 50,000 acres protected. Boundary Waters in Minnesota, 225,000 acres protected. Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 500,000 acres. The Castner range in Texas, 6,600 acres. Chaco Canyon, 330,000 acres in New Mexico. Bristol Bay and the Tongass Forest, 9 million acres in Alaska. All protected. And the list goes on. We’re working to designate 770,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean as a new National Marine sanctuary. And we’re going to get it done. This is an area larger than the Alaskan and Colorado put together and almost three times the size of Texas. It would make it the largest ocean area on the planet with the highest level of protection.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:56)', 'Speech': 'Look folks, just my first year in office, we, and I mean we, all of us in this room protected more land and waters than any president since John F. Kennedy. And on day one in my presidency, we moved to reenter the Paris Accord because the United States should lead the world, lead the world in climate. Last December, the world did follow our lead, when countries across the globe committed to safeguarding at least 30% of the lands and waters worldwide by 2030. And by the way, there’s more than one way to say they’re off limit. We’re paying farmers to plant carbon-absorbing plants. We’re paying farmers to put more in conservation. We’ve mobilized the world’s leading emitters to help poor countries deal with the impacts of climate change.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:49)', 'Speech': 'They called it the G7, the Biden Build Back Better. And we realize that got confusing. So now we don’t call it that. What we call it is, “Here’s the bottom line. Look, we’re the ones that caused the problem. The United States. We cleared all our land, we did all the things to make things more easy for us to make money. Not a bad thing at the time, no one really fully understood. But we, the major emitters in the world, have an obligation to help those countries.” Soon Africa will have 1 billion people. China has their Belt and Road initiative. It turned out to be their debt and destruction initiative. No, I’m serious. Not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:40)', 'Speech': 'Well, we’re going to win and we’re going to help. We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean. We have plans to build in Angola, one of the largest solar plants in the world. I can go on, but I’m not, I’m going off script. I’m going to get in trouble. But look, at the UN Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. We launched the Global Methane Pledge. When I raised it inside with a small group of people, they said, “I think we can do that.” We help recruit over 100 countries to follow the lead in setting strong standards to tackle methane pollution, oil and gas operation, holding companies accountable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:16)', 'Speech': 'Unfortunately, our MAGA republicans in Congress are trying to undo all the progress we’ve made. They made it abundantly clear when the first bill they passed, this new Congress, while they were holding the country hostage over the debt limit, was to repeal the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and replace them with handouts to the fossil fuel industry. Not a joke. Literally. They made clear that they’d rather threaten the fall of the US economy than cut or get rid of, for example, $30 billion in taxpayer subsidies to oil companies who made $200 billion last year. Imagine the choice. Imagine seeing all this happen. The wildfire, storms, floods and doing nothing about it. Imagine taking away those clean energy jobs from working class folks all across the country. Imagine turning your back on all those moms and dads living in towns poisoned by pollution and tell them, “Sorry, you’re on your own.” I was determined not to let that happen. And with your significant help, we didn’t let it happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:26)', 'Speech': 'We started negotiations with the MAGA Republican in Congress and they had a bullseye on the Inflation Reduction Act. They wanted to gut it. Remember that was the original proposal. They wanted to gut it. We didn’t budge. In the end, we didn’t just protect some of the climate and clean energy provisions. No. We protected every single solitary, one of them. Every one. The ink isn’t even dry on our agreement and they’re back at it again with a bill last week to repeal those clean energy tax credits that they attached billions of dollars in investments to, creating tens of thousands of jobs. With your help, we’re going to stop them again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:09)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. I was one of the first people to introduce climate in the United States Senate way back in 1986. And I come from the State of DuPont. Oh, excuse me, State of Delaware. We had more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. But I was convinced we had to begin this. When I was running for president, I made a priority to meet with environmental justice leaders and fence line communities. Their stories were unforgettable, and I knew they were true. I grew up in Claymont, Delaware, on the Pennsylvania State line where that arch goes up in Delaware, right along the Delaware River.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:53)', 'Speech': 'There are more oil refineries and Marcus Hook, in that area than any place, including Houston, Texas, taking care of 10 million people in the region. When we moved there, we lived in a place called Brookview Apartments and what’s I-95, it used to be, it’s called Philadelphia Pike. It was from Wilmington and Philadelphia. That was a four lane access road. It was too dangerous for a third grade kid to walk to school. It’s only about a half a mile. So my mother would drive to school every day. On cue, the first major frost and the late fall, my mom would get in the car, turn on the windshield wiper to get the dew off of it, and there’d be oil slicks, literally oil slicks on the windshield. How many folks across the country have had similar experiences? As a result, it saw higher than usual rates of childhood asthma, cancer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:57)', 'Speech': 'For the longest time, Delaware had one of the highest cancer rates in America in large part because the winds blow east, not north or south. Today those communities across the country, those people living downwind from these factories, seeing literally the paint on their cars peel off because the air is so corrosive. Landfills, garbage incinerators located right in the middle of communities, drinking water contaminated by radon and arsenic. That kind of inequity and injustice doesn’t just go against everything we stand for as a nation. And so when I got elected president, with Commonwealth’s partnership, we vowed to enact the most ambitious climate environmental justice campaign in American history. And that’s exactly what we’ve done with your health. We made a lot of progress, but there’s so much more to do. Getting to a hundred percent clean energy by 2035, moving to all electric vehicles in the future, made in America, building 500,000 EV charging stations, coast to coast, conserving 30% of our lands and waters by 2030.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:08)', 'Speech': 'And with your help, I’m optimistic, we’re going to get it done. Especially to support so many of young people across this country, representing your organizations. You represent the best of us. That’s not a hyperbole. You represent the best of us. That’s the God’s truth. And you are as important as any group in foreign policy dealing with national concerns. Because this is, I said, I’ll end where I began, the existential threat to humanity. So let’s finish the job. Let’s keep going. Every time I’d walk out of my grandfather’s Finnegan’s house up in Scranton, he yelled, “Joey, keep the faith,” and my grandmother yelled, “No Joey. Spread it. Spread it.” Let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. God bless you all and may God protect our truth. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Got a lot of work to do. A lot of work to do. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. We can do this.'}]"

Please have a seat. Good morning. So I’m going to start by saying that we are so thankful to all of the leaders who are here for the work that has occurred and will continue to be done to do what is right on behalf of the American people and working people in our country. I want to thank our president, Joe Biden, a true champion for the working people and families of our nation and a tireless fighter.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:08)', 'Speech': 'So, affordable and accessible high speed internet, not just for some, but for all. I want to thank the members of the cabinet who are here and members of Congress, as well as the advocates and community leaders who have fought for years to connect every corner of America with high speed internet. It is good to be here with all of you. So I will begin with a brief story. Last year I visited a small town in Louisiana called Sunset, [inaudible 00:01:42], a rural community of about 3000 people outside of Lafayette, a region where some of my extended family live. Sunset is like many other small towns in America. It has a main street with a bank, a church and a donut shop. And Sunset is similar to many rural communities for another reason, almost 40% of households in that area do not have high speed internet in large part, because the fiber optic lines that connect most Americans to the internet just never made it to Sunset.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:23)', 'Speech': 'But here’s what that means. In Sunset, I met with parents who cannot apply for remote work jobs, because they do not have a high speed internet connection at home. In Sunset, I met with entrepreneurs who struggled to start or grow a small business, because they cannot get online, and I met with students who, when public buildings were closed during the pandemic, had to sit in the parking lot of a local library just to submit their homework over WiFi. And these stories are not uncommon. Today, 24 million people in our country do not have access to high speed internet, either because they cannot afford the monthly cost of a plan or because they live in communities that have not yet been fully connected to fiber optic networks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:17)', 'Speech': 'But let us agree, in the 21st century, in America, high speed internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Every person in our nation, no matter where they live, should be able to access and afford high speed internet. And that is why our administration invested $65 billion to give millions of families a $30 discount on their monthly internet bills and to lay thousands of miles of new fiber optic lines, including in Sunset, where with the support of local leaders and elected officials, we are connecting 22,000 families with high speed internet. Today we are here to continue our work together, to connect every person in America with high speed internet. And now it is my honor to introduce a leader who understands firsthand the urgency and the impact of this work. An incredible leader, an incredible dad to his three daughters, Jeff Say.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:49)', 'Speech': 'We have to drive our children into my work, to my wife’s school or to our county library to finish projects or homework assignments. Every aspect of our daily life has now seemingly been touched by internet access; education, health, commerce, and entertainment. We are not alone. We now know that in Culpeper County there are 4,300 unserved homes when it comes to high speed internet access. Thankfully, our county has started a broadband initiative to serve the underserved. We don’t have it yet, but I know it’s on the way thanks to folks here, today. The reality is that reliable, affordable, high speed internet is a utility, not a luxury. So today, I’m excited to be here to share my story and to thank this administration, who will get our country up to speed, and into the 21st century. It is my extreme honor to be able to welcome a person who has made this issue a priority and will improve the quality of life, of all of our lives. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:24)', 'Speech': 'I like the fact Joe Manchin is standing all this time. He’s a friend. Hi Joe. Joe, how are you pal?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:44)', 'Speech': 'Before I began, let me say a few words about the events in Russia. And excuse, I have a little, an allergy. The situation began to develop. As it did, I directed my national security team to monitor closely and report to me hour-by-hour. I instructed them to prepare for a range of scenarios. I also convened our key allies on a Zoom call to make sure we’re all on the same page. It’s critical that we were coordinated in our response and coordinated in what to anticipate. They agreed with me that we had to make sure we gave Putin no excuse, let me emphasize, we gave no excuse to blame this on the West and blame this on NATO. We made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within the Russian system. I also talked in length with President Zelensky of Ukraine and we keeping in contact and maybe speaking later today, early tomorrow morning, to make sure we continue to remain on the same page.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:51)', 'Speech': 'I told them that no matter what happened in Russia, let me say it again, no matter what happened in Russia, we, the United States, would continue to support Ukraine’s defense and its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. He and I agreed to follow up and stay in constant contact. I’m also in constant contact with our allies to maintain our coordination. I’ll be speaking with the head of state right after this meeting today and making sure we’re on the same page. I didn’t get a chance to speak with one head of state yesterday. We’re going to keep assessing the fallout of this weekend’s events and implications for Russia and Ukraine, but it’s still too early to reach a definitive conclusion about where this is going. The ultimate outcome of all this remains to be seen, but no matter what comes next, I will keep making sure that our allies and our partners are closely aligned in how we are reading and responding to the situation. It’s important we stay completely coordinated.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:51)', 'Speech': 'And now I’d like to turn to today’s announcement, begin by asking a question; did you lay all that cable? She’s a Wonder Woman. I was watching in the other room, but I didn’t realize. I didn’t bring along all the cable. I, you know, the empty spools. You’re incredible. Thank you. Look, I want to thank you Jeff for taking the time and thank you for your introduction. There you are. And I want thank Kamala, who is there for every single important thing we do, and I’m not sure how we’d do it without her.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:24)', 'Speech': 'Two years ago, I asked her to lead an effort into high-speed internet and she’s been doing an incredible job since then. So is Gina, Gina Raimondo, our Commerce Secretary. And Shalanda Young, who is a jack of all trades, sitting here with our Office of Management and Budget. She’s played a major role in along with Mitch Landrieu, our Infrastructure Coordinator. And I want to thank, and I mean it sincerely, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who’s here with us today as well. And thank you to the leaders of state and local governments, labor unions, Tribal organizations and telecom companies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:59)', 'Speech': 'Folks we’re talking today about a major investment that we’re making an affordable, high-speed internet all across the country. As we started down, I turned to Jeff and I said, “You know, this may be… I wonder if President Roosevelt felt a little like this, as he talked about the electrification of our farmland.”. Think about it. It’s almost similar, but to put in context, let’s remember where we were two and a half years ago. The pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling and the problems we were facing started a lot earlier than that. For decades, for decades, and the middle class was hollowed out. Too many good-pay manufacturing jobs moved overseas, public investment was slashed, core sources of our economic strength, like infrastructure, manufacturing and innovation, were also hollowed out.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:48)', 'Speech': 'All that is result of failed economic policy, I called trickle-down economics, it was called trickle-down economics as well, a belief that we should give tax cuts to the very wealthy and big corporations and expect it to trickle down to everyone else, benefit across the board. I ran for president of a fundamentally different vision: to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down, to grow the economy by educating and empowering workers, by promoting competition to support small businesses and investing in ourselves again for the first time in a long time. And that’s what today’s announcement is all about.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:28)', 'Speech': 'What we’re doing is, as I said, not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm in our nation. Today, Kamala and I are making an equally historic investment to connect everyone in America, everyone in America, to high-speed internet, and affordable high-speed internet, by 2030. It’s the biggest investment in high-speed internet ever, because for today’s economy to work for everyone, internet access is just as important as electricity was or water or other basic services. Think of the parents and students sitting outside of McDonald’s or outside your office to be able to get on the internet, in a parking lot just so their child can go online to do their homework.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:10)', 'Speech': 'We just heard from Jeff, who has to drive his kids all over the town to find good internet connection. But he’s not alone in that, thousands of Americans are doing the same thing. Or small-business owners who are not able to reach more customers, or seniors unable to talk to their doctor through telemedicine. For around 24 million Americans across this country, there’s no high-speed internet and for millions more, their internet connection is limited or unreliable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:39)', 'Speech': 'High-speed internet isn’t a luxury anymore, it’s become an absolute necessity. That’s why we acted as soon as we did, as soon as we came to office, with the American Rescue Plan. It included $25 billion, $25 billion for high-speed internet in places where it was out of reach, for schools and libraries to help students connect to the internet if they couldn’t do it at home. After that, we signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, a once-in-a-generation investment to rebuild roads, bridges, ports, airports, and deliver water and high-speed internet to every American. And again, Joe, thank you for your help on that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:16)', 'Speech': 'To date, over 35,000 projects are either funded or already underway across the country thanks to that law. This includes hundreds of high-speed internet projects in the rural and Tribal communities. But, but, but, but it’s not enough to have access. You need affordability, in addition to access. That’s why we worked with internet service providers to bring down prices for Americans struggling with internet payments. It’s called the Affordable Connectivity Program. It’s helping 19 million families save around $30 a month on internet bills, and some save a lot more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:53)', 'Speech': 'These savings matters in homes like the one I grew up in. That’s money that can go for groceries, for the electric bill, for other things and other necessities. Kamala has traveled across the country, working with state and local officials, to make sure people know about this program. And several groups and companies here today have helped millions of Americans sign up through the ‘Online For All’ campaign, ‘Online For All’ campaign. Now, we’re working with Congress to extend this bipartisan program. Folks looking for an affordable internet plan, just go to GetInternet.gov. GetInternet.gov.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:27)', 'Speech': 'And today, we’re take another big step toward internet for all. We’re announcing over $40 billion to be distributed to 50 states, Washington, D.C., and territories to deliver high-speed internet in places where there’s neither service or it’s too slow. And, folks, and it includes rural communities like Appalachia, towns that Joe represents. It includes Tribal lands, from Alaska to the Dakotas, coastal towns from Hawaii to the Pacific Northwest. It also includes suburban communities, even cities, neighborhoods and, where there’s a lot of people, you think it’s automatic, but some still have to use dial-up connections to get online.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:11)', 'Speech': 'The funding for each state and territory is based on their specific needs, how many of their residents currently lack internet access and what it would cost to provide that access. With this funding, along with other federal investments, we’re going to be able to connect every person in America to reliable, high-speed internet by 2030.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:33)', 'Speech': 'I promised to be a president for all Americans, whether or not they voted for me or whether or not they voted for these laws. These investments will help all Americans. We’re not going to leave anyone behind. Don’t just take it from me. I’ve gotten letters and emails from across the country, from people who are thrilled that after so many years of waiting, they’re finally going to get high-speed internet.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:06)', 'Speech': 'A woman named Beth wrote me from Iowa. She lives in a valley that’s a dead zone to cell reception. She’s also gotten internet via satellite, which goes out when it rains or snows. She can’t get emergency alerts. Even in good weather, it’s spotty. Then, last year, a local telecom company, which just 13 employees, sent Beth a postcard. They had received funding from the American Rescue Plan. Now, they were installing fiber optic cable for homes, like hers, in the valley.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:39)', 'Speech': 'And here’s what she wrote to me, and I quote, “You can imagine my joy.”. She called them right away and the next day they sent someone out to survey her yard. As Beth wrote, “This is the best thing that’s happened to rural America since the Rural Electrification Act brought electricity to farms ’30s and ’40s.”. End of quote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:06)', 'Speech': 'Plus this investment means something else as well: good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. Just ask the folks at the IBEW or the Communication Workers or the Laborers Union. They’re putting thousands of people to work laying fiber optic cable across America and the cable will be made in America. Let me say that again. The cable’s going to be made in America. And that also means good-paying manufacturing jobs. It matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:42)', 'Speech': 'Folks, here’s the bottom line, by investing in America, we are delivering results. More than 13 million jobs created since I took office, nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. As a lot of folks are tired of hearing me say it; where in God’s name is it written that we can’t be the leading manufacturer in the world again? Where is that written? Since I’ve been in office, we’ve attracted $490 billion, $490 billion in private investment in new manufacturing, like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, fiber optic cable, and that we’re talking about here today. More people are starting small businesses than ever, and everyone who applies for a small business line is a sign of hope. All told, this is the strongest, fastest economic growth anywhere in the world, in the world. Jobs are back. Manufacturing is back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:38)', 'Speech': 'And in many places that have been left behind, pride is coming back as well. A lot of us lived in communities where they had thriving manufacturing bases and those seeking cheaper jobs moved overseas. Not only did you lose the jobs, but guess what happened? They lost pride in that neighborhood, that neighborhood that you came from. Everybody knew, they worked at the steel mill. They worked at their… They worked, whatever it was. In my case, it was coal mines and then steel. And folks, let me close with this. Connecting everyone in America to affordable, reliable high-speed internet is a bold gold, but we’re a great nation. Especially one as vast and geographically diverse as ours, it’s even bolder. We are all well on our way. We’re just going to have to keep it going and as you mentioned earlier, just remember: it’s never been a good idea to bet against America. Let’s remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:32)', 'Speech': 'God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming.'}]"

Tammy, God love you. You’re the best too. I tell you. But you know what? My good friend Dick Durbin, and he is a good friend. We’ve worked together a long, long time in the United States Senate. He’s the single most effective senator in getting things done. That’s not a joke. It’s not just judiciary committee. He’s made sure that we got more judges appointed. We’ve appointed more African American women to the federal bench than every other president combined. And he got the first and brightest Justice Ketanji Brown. I said I was going to put a Black woman on the court and he put her on the court for me. He put her on the court for me. Dick, you really are the best man. And by the way, when I have questions just about anything at all, beyond the judiciary, I still call him anyway for his advice. So thank you. And representative Danny Davis. Danny, you’ve been a good friend for a long time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:29)', 'Speech': 'He’s always there. And to all the elected officials, Member of Congress, elected officials here today, thank you. Thank you for the welcome and welcoming me to Chicago. You know, the first quarter of the 20th century, the poet Carl Sandberg describes Chicago as a city of big shoulders, a city of big shoulders. He was describing the big shoulders of a working class, American town who were building this city, same time building the middle class. I’m here in Chicago today for the first quarter of the 21st century to talk about the economic vision for this country. The economy that grows the economy from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down. When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy still do and everybody does well. The poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do well. We all do well. This vision is a fundamental break from the economic theory that has failed America’s middle class for decades now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:28)', 'Speech': 'It’s called trickle-down economics. Fundamental economics, trickle down. The idea was, it’s believed that we should cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations. And I know something about big corporations. There’s more corporations in Delaware incorporated than every other state in the union combined. I want them to do well, but I’m tired of waiting for the trickle down. It doesn’t come very quickly. Not much trickle down on my dad’s kitchen table growing up. And it is a belief that we should shrink public investment in infrastructure and public education. Shrink it. That we should let good jobs get shipped overseas and we actually have a tax policy that encourages them to go overseas to save money. We should let big corporations amass more power while making it harder to join a union. I meant what I said when I said I’m going to be the most pro-union President in American history, and I make no apologies for it. My predecessor of my mom were here and god bless his soul. My predecessor enacted the latest iteration of a failed theory. Tax cuts for the wealthy, it wasn’t paid for and an estimated cost of his tax cut was $2 trillion, $2 trillion. Now Republicans are at it again, pushing tax cuts for large corporations in the wealthy and adding trillions of dollars to the deficit. Trillions. Folks, let me say it as clearly as I can. The trickle down approach failed the middle class. It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity and it weakened our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride, and hope out of communities, one after another, particularly through the Midwest, Western Pennsylvania and heading west. People working as hard as ever couldn’t get ahead because it’s harder to buy a home, pay for college education, start a business, retire with dignity. The first time in the generation, the path of middle class seemed out of reach, and I don’t think it’s hyperbole, I think it’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:38)', 'Speech': 'No matter whether you’re a democrat, republican, or independent, I knew we couldn’t go back to the same failed policies when I ran. So I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country. To move from trickle-down economics to what everyone on Wall Street Journal of Financial Times began to call Bidenomics. I didn’t come up with the name. I really didn’t. I now claim it, but they’re the ones that used it first. I got asked by a press person this morning getting on the helicopter in Washington. “When I asked you about Bidenomics a long time ago, you said you didn’t know what it was.” I said, “I didn’t name it Bidenomics. I didn’t realize the economist in the Wall Street Journal did.” But I think it’s a plan that I’m happy to call Bidenomics. And guess what? Bidenomics is working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:27)', 'Speech': 'When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. Supply chains were broken. Millions of people unemployed, hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the verge of closing after so many had already closed. Literally hundreds of thousands on the verge of closing. Today, the US has the highest economic growth rate leading the world economies since the pandemic. The highest in the world. As Dick said, with this help, we’ve created 13.4 million new jobs. More jobs in two years than any president has ever made in four. In two. And folks, it’s no accident. That’s Bidenomics in action.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:13)', 'Speech': 'Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. And there are three fundamental changes that we decided to make with help from Congress and been able to do it. First, making smart investments in America. Second, educating and empowering American workers to grow the middle class, and third, promoting competition to lower costs to help small businesses. Here’s what I mean by all this. Under trickle-down economics, it didn’t matter whether you made things, as long as you helped the company’s bottom line. Even if that meant seeing jobs and industries go overseas for cheaper labor. Supply chains and key products moved overseas like China and much of Asia. The entire towns and communities'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:22)', 'Speech': 'Trickle-down also meant slashing public investment on things that helped drive long-term growth and helped America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2% of our gross domestic product in research and development. By the time I came to office, that was down to 0.7%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:40)', 'Speech': 'We used to be number one in the world in research and development. That’s what we’re known for. Now we rank number nine in the world. China, decades ago is number eight in the world. Now it’s number two in the world, and other nations are closing in fast.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:59)', 'Speech': 'We used to have the best infrastructure in the world, roads, bridges, et cetera. But then we fell to 13th best investment in infrastructure. Two to 13. How can you have the best economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? How do you get product from one place to another?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:21)', 'Speech': 'I was out in Pittsburgh recently, the City of Bridges. Bridges collapsing all over the nation. You’ve seen on television, railroad bridges collapsing. Bidenomics, we’re turning this around. We’re supporting targeted investments. We’re strengthening America’s economic security, our national security, our energy security, and our climate security.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:43)', 'Speech': 'I designed and we signed a bipartisan infrastructure law. It’s already announced and I heard some of the speakers before touting some of it. It’s already announced 35,000 projects across the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:55)', 'Speech': 'Think of it this way, nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt’s Rural Electrification Act, Rural Electrification brought electricity to millions of Americans in rural America. 70 years ago, Dwight Eisenhower launched the Interstate Highway System, the largest infrastructure project to date in history. That’s what the bipartisan infrastructure law does. It will be for our kids and grandkids, only bigger.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:22)', 'Speech': 'Just last week, we announced our plan to bring affordable high speed internet to end the decade of unaffordable and inaccessible internet to every home in America, every small business in America. And to no one’s surprise, it’s bringing along some converts. People strenuously opposed, voting against it when we had this going on. They were, “This was going to bankrupt America.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:53)', 'Speech': 'Well, there’s a guy named Tuberville, the senator from Alabama, who announced that he strongly opposed the legislation. Now he’s healing his passage. Here’s what he said, quote, “It’s great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:15)', 'Speech': 'We’re replacing every single lead pipe in this country and putting our children’s health back directly. 400,000 schools, 10 million homes. We’re fixing crumbling bridges, upgrading our power grid, renovating our airports and ports. And Dick, one of you talked about that, how important that is for the Great Lakes as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:40)', 'Speech': 'Anyway, last week we reopen opened I-95 back where I live, and you go up the East Coast. It’s a one of the most important links in the entire East Coast. Well, guess what? A guy driving a truck hit a… Anyway, he knocked down the whole bridge and the whole block, four lanes of the highway. I went up there and I said, “We’re going to get this the number one project to get done.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:06)', 'Speech': 'Within one week of my being there, two weeks of it happening, tanker trucks that crashed and caused this overpass… That that has 150,000 vehicles travel on it every day and 14,000 trucks. It’s critical to our economy. We did it with union workers. We closed all the loopholes. We used all-American products. All-American materials. We use federal infrastructure project and made in America. Made in America. Not a slogan, it’s actually happening.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:43)', 'Speech': 'When Roosevelt passed the legislation in the ’30s about unions being able to be engaged, everybody think they just legalized unions? It said we should encourage unions. There was a little provision there that very few presidents paid attention to. It said, “Buy American.” That meant that if a president was given money by the Congress to build, say, a new decadent aircraft carrier. Whatever it was, he or she was supposed to use 100% American labor and 100% American products.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:12)', 'Speech': 'It hardly happened. We get exceptions down to 30%, et cetera. I changed all that. We’re now investing in key industries of the future, making targeted investments to promote domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, electric cars, clean energy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:29)', 'Speech': 'Under the trickle-down economic theory was that public investment would discourage private investment. Give me a break. We went to see a whole lot of major corporations, said, “Are you more or less likely to invest if the government invests?” Overwhelmingly, they had it backward. They said, “No, we’re more likely to invest if the government invests.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:50)', 'Speech': 'Public investment declined here at home. Industries that we invented started to move overseas, like semiconductors. I want to remind you, America invented these chips. Small computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that effect nearly everything in your life, from whether your cell phone functions, your automobiles can be built, refrigerators work. It goes on and on, into sophisticated weapon systems. It’s all in that little comp’. Without that computer chip, we got a real problem. But over time, we went from producing 40% of those world chips down to 10%. Not anymore. Bidenomics means industry of the future are going to grow right here at home. At home. I mean it. Not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:42)', 'Speech': 'Under Bidenomics, we’ve already had over $490 billion in private investment commitments. $490 billion from US companies and companies around the world coming to the United States of America, working with our global partners. Americans’ investments in clean energy technology are going to reduce carbon emissions, continue to lower the cost of wind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:09)', 'Speech': 'You talked about the wind farm you’re talking about. It’s already cheaper. Wind and solar are already significantly cheaper than coal and oil. You’re not going to see anybody building a new coal-fired plant in America. Not just because I’d like to pass a law to say that. It’s too expensive. It doesn’t work anymore. Solar power is not just here but around the world, and we used to be the center of building these solar panels. We are coming back and doing it again. America’s going to lead again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:40)', 'Speech': 'Look, it’s a win for the United States and a win for the world, that builds on my decision to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on the first day I came to office, the first day. And by the way, my predecessor talked a lot about increasing manufacturing. Remember infrastructure week? Infrastructure week became infrastructure week and week and week and week and week. It never happened. We got infrastructure decade done right off the bat.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:15)', 'Speech': 'But in reality, construction of manufacturing facilities here on US soil grew only 2% on my predecessor’s watch. In four years, 2%. On my watch, it’s grown nearly 100% in two years, 100%. With help of all the members of Congress are here, and I’m not being solicitous.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:38)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re here in West Virginia, where a steel mill closed in the beginning of this century, in 2001 or ’02, in that range. It employed thousands and it had thousands of good paying jobs. They were lost. But today with the help of the Inflation Reduction Act, a new plant’s being built, building iron air batteries, which are going to help store energy and these batteries are going to help store energy. And it’s being built on the same exact site, bringing back 750 good paying jobs, bringing back a sense of pride and hope for the future for all the people of Warrenton and surrounding areas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:17)', 'Speech': 'I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to say where they grew up and stay where they grew up. That’s Bidenomics. My dad used to have an expression, he’d say, “Joey…” And I give my word, as you say, my dad was a well-read guy, never got to go to college and a hardworking gentleman.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:36)', 'Speech': ""We had dinner, where we incidentally had conversation and incidentally ate. My dad used to say, “Remember, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck.” And I mean this and give my word. He would say, “A job’s about a lot more than the paycheck, Joey. It’s about your dignity. It’s about pride. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” Think about it. I mean, literal sense. Think about that. It’s about your dignity, how you’re treated, and being able to make a living. You can tell your kids it’s going to be okay.""}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:09)', 'Speech': 'The second big part of Bidenomics is empowering American workers. When I took office, unemployment was over 6%. With the American Rescue Plan, we provided relief and support directly to working class families. Our economy came roaring back. Unemployment dipped below 4% by the end of my first year in office. Now it’s been below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years of American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:34)', 'Speech': 'And I must admit I concentrated on, but we’ve seen with the help of Jesse Jackson’s legacy and a lot of other people here, we’ve seen record low unemployment for African Americans. Record low unemployment for African Americans and Hispanic workers with disabilities. The lowest unemployment rate in 70 years for'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:03)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, the other thing I’ve told labor guys, you got to brag a little bit more about what you do. You realize to get a license to be an electrician in this town or any other, you got to essentially go to four years of college. You have to go through an apprenticeship that takes you four years to five, depending, or you can’t get a job. You get paid a little bit, but you can’t get your license to be a labor electrician until that happens. Look, pay for low wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades. Full employment means workers, especially low wage workers, having more bargaining power to demand good pay, to secure good jobs, and this is a thing that is consistent with whether people think that we’re moving in the right direction. Job satisfaction based on every poll is at a 36-year-high. More people are satisfied with their jobs than any time in 36 years. And the shame of working age Americans in the workforce, the share of them is the highest it’s been in 20 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:07)', 'Speech': 'Remember what there were saying? Biden policy isn’t working. He’s just paying people not to work, people on the sidelines. Well, guess what? Every single day in four years, before I took office, you may remember I took a lot of criticism in my presidency. Republican charged me, were encouraging people to stay home, not work. Well they were wrong. The evidence is clear. Americans are back to work who’ve been in the sidelines and they want to come back, and we’re going to continue this progress and make sure every American has the training and education to participate in this new economy. We’ve increased Pell Grants, made landmark investments in historic black universities. We’ve invested more in registered apprenticeships and career technology education program than any previous administration in American history. Because of this new economy, we don’t need everyone to have a four-year degree. It’s great if you can get one. We’re trying to make it easier for you to get one, but you don’t need it to get a good paying job anymore.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:07)', 'Speech': 'Think of this, how many of you remember going back to high school and they had shop class and they had classes where people can learn if they were interested in working with their hands? They don’t have them very much anywhere around the country. But my wife teaches at a community college, full-time still. She has an expression. She said, “Any country that out-competes, that, excuse me, out- educates us, will out-compete us.” We’re not going to let that happen. That’s why we’re investing significantly in education. I’m determined to keep fighting for universal pre-K and free community college. We’re also fighting to make childcare more affordable because we know one benefit is that it opens up significant opportunities for parents to be able to go back and join the workforce. We’re also making it easier to empower workers by making it easier to join a union.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:07)', 'Speech': 'As I said, I promised to be the most pro-union president in history and I tell business leaders all the time, “Our union workers are the best in the world.” It takes four to five years to end that apprenticeship. It’s like going to college. They’ll do the right job on time. Long-term cost for business is less. Addressing the 40-year decline in unionization by supporting project labor agreements, collective bargaining, prevailing wage laws, that’s the reason today America support union is higher than it’s been in 60 years. 60 years. By the way, I met with the business round table and others. They said, “Why am I so pro-union?” I said, “Because it helps you.” It really does. Think about it. The total cost of a major project goes down when you have the best workers in the world doing it. Not a joke. It’s true. It lasts longer. You don’t have to worry about whether that socket’s going to work. Look, young people are organizing new companies and industries. I’ve indicated to labor leaders, they must expand their ranks. As I said, more women, more minorities. That’s what they got to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:17)', 'Speech': 'Third part of Biden economics is promoting competition because when companies have to compete on a level playing field, they have to work harder to attract customers and recruit and retrain workers. Some of you business people in here know that well. But under the trickle down economic theory, three quarters of US industries grew more consecrated. I mean, excuse me, consecrated. I’m thinking I didn’t go to mass. They were moving to diminish competition. Well, that may have been things that made things easier for big corporations, but for everybody else, it made it harder, more expensive. It got harder for small businesses to compete. It stifled integration, it reduced wages for workers, and it made our supply chains more vulnerable. So folks, that’s been the Republican plan so far. Good for big business, bad for everybody else. It’s not even that good for big business anymore.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:22)', 'Speech': 'When I came to office with a very different plan, a limited conservation of power at the expense of consumers, the cops are backing the beat of forcing antitrust laws. My administration is working to crack down on what we used to call non-compete agreements. We still call them that. These prevent 30 million Americans, from security guards to retail workers, from walking across the street to a same kind of business and getting a higher pay, getting five bucks more a week or 10 bucks more a week. Non-compete agreements. It’s one thing to have non-compete agreements when you’re dealing with trade secrets. It’s another thing when you’re doing the same thing or flipping a hamburger and you’re going to get 5 cents more by walking across the street to a different place.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:07)', 'Speech': 'Also, we promoted and we’re supporting small businesses. Vice President Harris has prioritized providing support and capital for small business owners, including for rural minorities and women, entrepreneurs, including through a brand new program that’s already helping deliver billions of dollars in growth capital to small businesses in every state. We’ve seen a record 10. 5 million applications, folks looking to start a small business just in the last two years, 10.5. Every one of those applications is an application of hope. Competition also means lowering cost for consumers. Bringing down inflation remains one of my top priorities. Today, inflation is less than half of what it was a year ago, and that inflation caused by Russia and by the war in Ukraine and by what’s going on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:02)', 'Speech': 'But we knew we had to do more. There’s more than one way to bring down cost. Another expression my dad used to use for real, he’d say, Joey, he said, “At the end of the month, the question is, after you pay all your bills, do you have just a little left for breathing room? Just a little left for breathing room? All your bills paid. Do you have anything left?” Well, inflation eats into that obviously, but guess what? Bringing down the cost of medication goes a long way to giving you a little more. That’s why through the Inflation Reduction Act, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like the VA does now. We’ve been trying to get this done, Dick and I for decades in the Senate. This time, we finally beat big pharma for the first time. Same drug made by the same American company, sold in Chicago, is more expensive than that same drug sold in Toronto, Great Britain, France, Germany, any city you can name. For real.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:16)', 'Speech': 'Now, seniors on Medicare are paying as much as 400 less, who were paying $400 a month for insulin last year are now paying $35 a month because guess what? You know how much it costs to make that insulin? 10, T-E-N dollars. Package it, maybe 12 total. And the guy who invented the insulin didn’t even ask for a patent because he wanted everybody to have access to it. We’re just finishing the first round of negotiating drug prices and we’ll save the taxpayers this year $160 billion. That’s like a tax cut. Lowers the cost of [inaudible 00:32:01] jobs and it lowers the federal deficit as well. We’re expanding healthcare coverage for more Americans building on Barack’s Affordable Care Act. You know why we’re doing that? I’m proud to strengthen that act, saving average families $800 a year on their healthcare premiums.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:21)', 'Speech': 'We’re also fighting junk fees. Most people don’t think of that. Well, here’s a junk fee. They can add up to hundreds of dollars a month for a family. Like that extra fee when you say, “I want my child to sit next to me” when I take him to see grandpa on the West coast. It’s not listed now. They’re listing it now. Hotel resort fees, you don’t realize, you’re not told they’re going to be the… You know that ad in television? Mine is $200, his is 180. Well, guess what? Or the one that bothers me the most is overdraft fees for banks. The banks made $7.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:24)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we’re doing this, doing all this, reducing the deficit at the same time. Just in my first two years in office, my team and I have reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion, more than any president had, just in two years. And the budget agreement I negotiate without having to give away anything of consequence, reduced the deficit by another trillion dollars. Reversing 40 years of Republican trickle-down economics that helped a few but hurt the middle class, it’s going to take some time. But we’re in a place where some big pieces, and we’re moving in a direction where we can get some more done and people will see it. What I’m doing, and I knew I’d have to do this. All those major legislations be passed. People go, “That’s great.” But then it takes time to get it out in the field. Takes time for them to see it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:23)', 'Speech': 'And I’m not here to declare victory on the economy. I’m here to say we have a plan that’s turning things around incredibly quickly. Well, we have more work to do. For example, does anyone here think that federal tax system is fair, raise your hand? No matter how much money you make. We’re going to make it fair by eliminating loopholes for crypto traders. Hedge fund managers, big oil made $200 billion last year and got a $30 billion tax break. We’re going to get billionaires to pay up a little bit, at least a minimum tax. When we began, there were 750 before the pandemic. 750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know how much their average tax is? They pay federal tax, 8% taxes, no billionaire should pay lower tax rate than a school teacher, a firefighter, a cop.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:23)', 'Speech': 'I’m not talking about the old, old days of 70% tax. I’m talking about a fair shot. If they just paid the top top tax rate that exists now, which is lower than 30%, we’d raise billions and billions of dollars lowering the deficit, allowing us to pay for so much more we have to do. That’s the next phase of this fight. Making the tax code fair for everyone. Making the wealthy, the super wealthy and big corporations began to pay their fair year share without raising taxes at all on the middle class. I made a commitment when I got elected. No one in America making under $400,000 to ever have to pay a single penny more in federal taxes as long as I’m president. And I’ve kept that promise. And $400,000 is a lot of money where I come from.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:16)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. When I came to office, I had a fundamental decision to make. We’re going to continue to trickle down economic as a policy that’s failed time and again, that grew in inequality, that saw jobs go overseas, that saw, and you’ve seen it out here, towns hollowed out. I ran in the promise I was going to end this, and that I began to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. We’re not going to continue down the trickle down path as long as I’m president. This is the moment we’re finally going to make a break, and move away from economy that has existed in a fundamentally different direction. Here’s a simple truth about trickle-down economics. It didn’t represent the best of American capitalism, let alone America. It represented a moment where we walked away, and how many in this country from how this country was built, how this city was built.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:13)', 'Speech': 'Bidenomics is about the future. Bidenomics is just another way of saying restore the American dream, because it worked before. It’s rooted in what we’ve always worked best at in this country. Investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, we strengthen the middle class. We see the economy grow, that benefits all Americans. That’s the American dream. 40 years of trickle down limited that dream, except for those at the top. Too many for too long have seemingly suggested that it’s only available if you have a four-year college degree and you can work at a tech center. These new factories that are opening, these fabs that are opening for semiconductors, without a college degree, you’re going to make $100 to $130,000 a year working in those fab. $100 to $130,000 a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:15)', 'Speech': 'Well, I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they are. In the heartland, in small towns and every part of this country, to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up. That’s Bidenomics. I think the economic philosophy’s not going to restore the American dream that we have now, that philosophy. But there’s new and will. And I think it’s going to help lessen the division of this country by bringing us back together. It makes it awful hard to demagogue something when it’s working, although they do it all the time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:50)', 'Speech': 'I’ve long said, and I mean this, I was on the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping. I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I’ve spoken with him more than any other state. Because it started when I was vice president and President Hu was the president and he was the vice president. We knew he was going to be his successor. It was inappropriate for Barack to spend that time with him. But I spent a lot of time with him. I met alone with him, just he and I and a simultaneous interpreter. 68 times, 68 hours, 68 times more than 68 hours. By the way, I turned in all my notes. And this is the Gods truth, he asked me… We’re in a Tibetan plateau. And he asked me, he said, “Can you define America for me?” And I said, “Yes in one word.” And I meant it. “Possibilities. Possibilities.” We’re a land of possibilities. And I told him, “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. Never.” And I can honestly say, I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. I swear to God. I’ve never been more optimistic. Just remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

And I want to particularly thank my good friend Jim Clyburn. The truth of the matter is, all of you know it in South Carolina, I wouldn’t be standing here were it not for Jim Clyburn. Jim has been one of the most consequential leaders in South Carolina history, in my view. He’s tough, he’s loyal, he’s principled. And he let me … I want to tell you something: If he has your back, he always has your back. And, Jim, it’s good to be back in your home with you and your daughter. And, look, former Mayor Steve Benjamin couldn’t be here today, and you all remember Steve as your mayor, because he’s traveling with his family. And it’s great to have him here, have him as part of our team. But his mom and dad are here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:35)', 'Speech': 'By the way, if you have seats, sit down. I’m sorry. I once said, “Everybody take a seat,” and there were no seats. They said, “Biden is so stupid, he didn’t know there were no seats.” Anyway.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:48)', 'Speech': 'I also want to thank the leadership of Enphase and Flex for hosting us. I’m here to talk about what we’re doing to invest in America, and I mean invest in America, all of America; it’s starting here South Carolina, and to talk about the progress we made in building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not trickling down. When you build from the middle out and bottom up, everybody does well, and the wealthy still do very well. With that trickle-down economy, not a whole lot dropped on my Dad’s kitchen table growing up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:22)', 'Speech': 'It’s all part of an economic vision for this country. I came to office determined, to the point of some on my own team thought I was too determined, to change the economic direction of this country, to move trickle-down economics and get rid of it for everyone, from The Wall Street Journal to the Financial Times called the program “Bidenomics.” I’m not sure they meant it as a compliment at the time. Our plan is working. And one of the things I’m proudest of is that it’s working everywhere, not just on the coasts and big cities, like previous recoveries. This time, investment is working, and factories are being built, and jobs are being created, happening in rural America, the heartland, all across America, in communities that have been left out and hollowed out. This is what it looks like across the country. Over 13 million new jobs since I’ve been elected to office, more jobs than any president has ever created in their first two years. Nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs, including 14,000 in this state alone, this state alone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:29)', 'Speech': 'And again, that’s more in two years than was created in four years in any other administration. Unemployment has been below 4% for the longest time in 50 years. Inflation is less than half of what it was a year ago, and we’re continuing to work on it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:47)', 'Speech': 'I know we have more to do. Bringing down inflation remains one of my top priorities. Job satisfaction nationally is at a 36-year high. The share of working-age Americans in the workforce is as high as it’s been in 30 years. Remember they used to say, “Biden is spending all this money to keep people from working”? People are off the sidelines. Twenty years high, higher than every single one of my predecessors. And the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in two decades. And, folks, it’s no accident. It’s Bidenomics in action. Trickle-down economics has failed the country for decades. It means slashing public investment on things that helped America lead the world in innovation. We used to invest 2% of our entire gross domestic product in research and development. You know what it is now? .7 percent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:50)', 'Speech': 'We used to be ranked number one in the world in research and development. Know what we’re ranked now? Number nine. China was number eight a decade ago, and now China is number two. And other countries are closing in fast. This is the United States of America, for God’s sake. We used to have the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one. Now we’re rated number 13 in the world in infrastructure. How can you have the best economy in the world and not have the best infrastructure in the world?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:22)', 'Speech': 'Under my predecessor, Infrastructure Week became a punchline. Every month. Anyway, I won’t get into it. On my watch, we’re making infrastructure a decade headline. A decade. Yesterday, we announced that since I took office, we have attracted a half a trillion dollars, $497 billion in private investment in American manufacturing, both here and around the world. It’s historic, and it’s Bidenomics in action. Instead of exporting jobs to cheaper labor costs, what we did for decades, we’re creating jobs here and exporting American product. Product, not jobs. That’s the story here in South Carolina.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:09)', 'Speech': 'Earlier, we heard the leadership of Enphase say that $60 million they’re investing here. Well, that’s 1,800 jobs across the country and up 600 permanent jobs right here in South Carolina, all a direct result of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act we wrote and passed. Well, that’s the legislation that passed where so much money is coming in to make all this happen. And, by the way, parenthetically, you’re going to hear about the deficit, I cut the deficit $1.7 trillion in two years. Nobody has ever done that. Cut the debt 1.7. This generates income. It generates growth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:57)', 'Speech': 'Enphase first commercialized the component that converts solar energy into electricity. All that solar energy doesn’t do a whole lot of good if you can’t do it and convert it into electricity. It’s called, they invented a thing called a solar microinverter.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:15)', 'Speech': 'Jobs that used to go to Mexico, India, Romania, and China are now coming home to South Carolina. Now Enphase is partnering with Flex to make these parts here in South Carolina. And today, they’re shipping their first microinverters made in America. Made in America. And the good news is 90% of these jobs require intelligence but don’t require a college degree. And Flex is working with Midlands Technical College in Columbia to develop training and pathways so folks can get these jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:58)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, we’ve seen over 60 domestic manufacturing announcements all across the solar supply chain. One of the biggest is in Dalton, Georgia. You may find it hard to believe, but that’s Marjorie Taylor Greene’s district. I’ll be there for the groundbreaking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:22)', 'Speech': 'Look, and just today the Department of Energy announced new incentives for companies to bring solar power manufacturing back to our shores. We’re in a real race; China is ahead of us. This is another step in helping us meet the goal of 100% clean, renewable energy electricity by 2035. By 2035, all electricity in America is going to be generated by clean energy, that’s a big deal, and saving billions of tons going into the air of pollution.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:54)', 'Speech': 'We see the same story in semiconductors, those small, little computer chips the size of the tip of your finger that affect nearly everything in our lives, from your cellphone to automobiles and refrigerators to the most sophisticated weapons systems. They need these. And guess what? America invented these chips. We’re the ones who invented them. We sophisticated those chips. We made them what they are. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40% of the world’s chips down to less than 10%. That’s why we designed and I signed the CHIPS and Science Act, all these names don’t mean much until you know what they produce, because I knew we had to reclaim America’s leadership.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:37)', 'Speech': 'Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing a record hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, all across the … Like outside Columbus, Ohio, Intel is investing, in a thousand acres outside of Ohio, $20 billion. Twenty billion. It’s going to take 7,000 people to build the two, they call them fabs, factories. And it’s going to take 5,000 permanent workers. Near Syracuse, Micron is investing up to $100 billion over the next 20 years, beginning now. In Phoenix, Arizona, TSMC is investing $40 billion, producing thousands of good-paying jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:23)', 'Speech': 'As I said, for example, in Ohio, 7,000 jobs building the facility are going to generate economic growth in that entire region outside of Columbus because they’re generating, they bring along, you need stores, you need drugstores, you need a lot of things to maintain those jobs. And we’re also seeing 3,000 jobs, those 3,000 jobs working in the fabs. You can make $100,000 a year. That’s the average salary. And you don’t need a college degree to make a hundred grand.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:55)', 'Speech': 'The middle class, this is a game-changer, where Investing in America agenda is about bringing supply chains home, a clean energy future, made in America. Before the pandemic, supply chains weren’t something most Americans thought about. If I said to you six years ago, “We’re worried about a supply chain,” you’d look at me like, “Huh?” Well, I would have looked at you the same way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:19)', 'Speech': 'But today, after delays in parts and products, everybody knows why supply chains matter. We know for too long China has dominated the production of raw materials needed for critical products. That’s why we’re building alliances with our friends all across the world, increasing our production here at home to create alternative sources for the minerals we need. Our goal is to bring the full battery supply chain home. We create a Battery Belt stretching from Michigan to Georgia.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:52)', 'Speech': 'In Chester County, South Carolina, Albemarle is investing $1.5 billion to process lithium for electric vehicle batteries. That’s not only to create 300 permanent jobs, but it’ll left up a whole community, a whole community, restore some pride. It matters. The lithium will power components like it’s going to be taking … being made in Redwood Mineral. Excuse me, Redwood Materials near Charleston, where the company is making the largest investment in the history of this state: $3.5 billion to build a battery materials manufacturing plant, creating 1,500 jobs. That’s another community-changer. It’s a game-changer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:44)', 'Speech': 'And those materials will go into batteries that will be recycled by companies like Cirba Solutions, which is investing $300 million here in Richland County, creating another 300 permanent jobs. That’s community after community after community there’s been that change. And it’s on its way. If you change enough communities, it’s going to change the state, it’s going to change the country. In Jim Clyburn’s district, Pomega Energy Storage Technologies is investing $279 million to manufacture batteries to store energy to power the grid.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:25)', 'Speech': 'Look, what do you think we’d have said if I came when I was here trying to get the nomination three years ago, and I told you while I was campaigning, that we’d see this kind of investment in South Carolina, billions of dollars? I think you would’ve been a little skeptical. But that’s why I fought so hard for the things I wanted to do. We didn’t get much help from the other team, but that didn’t stop us from getting it done. And that’s going to transform America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:55)', 'Speech': 'All told, since I signed the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act into law, companies have announced $11 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments just in South Carolina. Eleven billion dollars. Companies across country are expanding factories, building new ones, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, most of which don’t require a four-year degree.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:28)', 'Speech': 'And when I say every job in America should be a good job, including a free and fair choice to join a union, I mean it. Every venture to manufacture clean energy technology would be made stronger by collective bargaining relationships. But that’s up to you do decide. It’s not just manufacturing. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’ve already announced over 35,000 projects all across America, like the Brent Spence Bridge, which is a billion-dollar operation, over the Ohio River from Ohio to Kentucky. And today, in New York, we’re investing a record, a billion dollars to renew the Hudson Tunnel. You walk through that tunnel, it was built 100 years ago. It’s falling apart. You’ll be able to go through it 100 miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:25)', 'Speech': 'Up in Union County, South Carolina, we’re rebuilding six bridges critical to moving people and goods across this region. Each bridge is over 60 years old with weight and volume restrictions that cause detours, congestion, and supply chain delays. The oldest one is where South Carolina 49 crosses the Tyger River. The biggest one is right here in Columbia: Malfunction Junction. You all know it. How many years you’ve been talking about fixing Malfunction Junction? Well, now, thanks to Jim Clyburn and help from the infrastructure law, it’s finally going to get fixed. It’s going to get fixed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:07)', 'Speech': 'And we’re removing every single lead pipe in America. More than 100,000 lead service lines go into homes here in South Carolina. And they’re a risk to everyone’s health, including children, so it’s time to get them removed and replaced.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:18)', 'Speech': 'We’re building. We’re helping Richland School District One here in Columbia purchase 16 new electric buses. Because, guess what? The diesel buses cause asthma. They cause problems. They cause additional problems.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:30)', 'Speech': 'You all remember, during the pandemic, that thousands of people in this state didn’t have a connection to a high-speed Internet, wherever, in their business or their home. Everybody now talks about “We’re going to close that digital divide,” that divide between those who have a reliable Internet connection and those who don’t. South Carolina is receiving $1 billion to close that divide, connecting every home and small business across rural America and rural South Carolina that doesn’t have reliable high-speed Internet. Thanks to Jim Clyburn’s Affordable Connectivity Program, a fancy name, but it’s real, that’s saying that 359,000 South Carolinian families are already saving $30 a month on their Internet bills.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:21)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re doing this in communities all over the country. You can see exactly where the money is going and whether you’re affected in your community here by going to Invest.gov. Click onto Invest.gov, put in your location, and they’ll tell you what’s happening in your community. You’ll all see projects we’re delivering in communities all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:47)', 'Speech': 'Look, implementing this legislation also has another transformative impact. All those members of Congress who voted against it suddenly realize how great it is, and they’re bragging about it. As my mother would say, “God love them.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:03)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank Senator Graham for voting for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, though I wish he’d voted for the rest. Every Republican member of the Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. Every one. Every Republican member of the House in this state voted to repeal the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that attracted all these jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:33)', 'Speech': 'And then after that effort failed, the Republican Study Committee, which includes over three-quarters of the House Republicans, just released a plan to go and try to repeal it all again. That hasn’t stopped them, though, from claiming credit now that billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are coming to the United States. It’s not unusual. The distinguished senator from the state of Alabama, a former coach of the university, strongly opposed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He’s now hailing its passage. He said, quote, “Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts.” It is great. But that’s alright, because I’m one of those guys who believe in conversion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:21)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, on a very serious note, when I ran, when I got elected, when I proposed these pieces of legislation, I made a commitment that I would be president for all Americans, whether their elected officials voted for the events or not, all Americans, whether you voted for me or not. And I’ve kept my promise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:41)', 'Speech': 'In fact, some analysis have said that the laws I’ve signed are doing more to help red America than blue America. Well, that’s okay with me, because we’re all Americans. Because my view is: Wherever the need is most, that’s the place we should be helping. And that’s what we’re doing. Because the way I look at it, the progress we’re making is good for all Americans, all of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:05)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. I’m not here to declare victory on the economy. I’m here to say we have a plan that’s turning things around quickly, but we have a lot more work to do. When I came to office, we had a fundamental decision to make: Would we continue down the trickle-down economic path, a policy that’s failed us time and again, that grew inequality, that saw jobs shipped overseas, towns hollowed out? When I ran, I promised we would not continue down the trickle-down path. But here’s the simple truth about trickle-down economics: It represented a moment when we walked away from how this country was built. Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the American Dream. Forty years of trickle-down limited that dream to those at the top. But I believe that every American willing to work hard should be able to get a good job no matter where they live, in the heartland, in the small towns, in every part of this country, to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up. That’s the American Dream.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:12)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to have an expression for growing up. My word. He’d say, “Joey, a job is a lot about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:24)', 'Speech': 'That’s Bidenomics. It’s rooted in what always worked best for this country: investing in America. Because when you invest in our people, when you strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth that benefits everybody. I’ve long said it’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And I can honestly say it’s never been. I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who we are, for God’s sake. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So let’s continue to work together. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

It’s consequential. The light of Lithuania, you kept it strong, you kept it bright, and you kept the light shining. Here in Vilnius, and Washington, DC where the yellow, green and red of your flag flew every day, this past year we’ve celebrated 100 years of unbroken diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Baltic States. America never recognized the Soviet occupation of Baltic. Never, never, never. And besides, you’ve got a great president. Stand up. Come on, stand up. And the president can tell you the bond between Lithuania and the American people have never faltered. And just seven months after the bloody January crackdown, the first foreign visitor to have their passport stamped here in Lithuania with visas to this new reborn state, were a plane load of Lithuania Americans from Chicago, Illinois. And their families are still proud of that. Los Angeles came after that. A lot came after.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:03)', 'Speech': 'Look, many aboard that plane that fled Lithuania during the early years of Soviet oppression, and marveled at their return to this independent state. One of them told reporters, “This day is like a resurrection for us. This day, Father, is like a resurrection for us.” That’s what the quote was for real. That’s the feeling. And it was. A resurrection that quickly became a revelation, and a nation which stands today as a stronghold of liberty and opportunity, a proud member of the European Union and of NATO. I had the great honor as United States Senator to champion Lithuania and other Baltic states to join NATO in 2004. Wasn’t I brilliant doing that? But all kidding aside, think about it changed things? Think about what’s happening. Now over the last few days, as President of the United States I had the honor of participating in the historic NATO summit hosted by Lithuania, where we welcome NATO’s newest ally, Finland, and reached agreement to bring Sweden into the alliance as soon as possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:25)', 'Speech': 'President [inaudible 00:10:26] kept his word. We’ve witnessed your historic journey, and I’m proud to call Lithuania friend, partner, and ally. Ally. Ally. Soon, NATO will have 32 freestanding members standing together to defend our people in our territory. Beyond all the rest, bound by democratic values to make us strong, and by our sacred oath. It is a sacred oath. Attack against one is an attack against all, because each member of NATO knows that the strength of our people and the power of our unity cannot be denied. If I sound optimistic, it’s because I am. Today, our lives remains a bulwark of global security and stability, as it’s been for more than seven decades. NATO is stronger, more energized, and yes, more united than ever in its history. Indeed, more vital to our shared future. It didn’t happen by accident. It wasn’t inevitable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:44)', 'Speech': 'When Putin and his craven luster of land and power unleashed his brutal war in Ukraine, he was betting NATO would break apart. He was betting NATO would break. He thought our unity would shatter at the first testing. He thought democratic leaders would be weak, but he thought wrong. Faced with a threat to peace and stability of the world, to democratic values we hold dear, to freedom itself, we did what we always do. The United States stepped up, NATO stepped up, our partners in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific stepped up. All across the world they stepped up. And we were ready. We were ready because we stood together. In the months leading up to the war, as Putin amassed his forces at the Ukrainian border and laid the groundwork for his brutal invasion, I was in constant contact with my fellow leaders of the G7 and the European Union and NATO. Constantly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:51)', 'Speech': 'We warned the world what Putin was planning. Even some Ukrainians didn’t believe what we had, our intelligence community found. We made sure NATO was prepared to deter any aggression against any member state. We pursued an intense diplomacy with Russia, seeking to avert this terrible war. And when Russia bombs began to fall, we did not hesitate to act. We rallied the world to support the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their liberty and their sovereignty with incredible dignity. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Think about it. Think about what they’re doing. After nearly a year and a half of Russia’s forces committing terrible atrocities, including crimes against humanity, the people of Ukraine remain unbroken. Unbroken. Ukraine remains independent. It remains free. And the United States has built a coalition of more than 50 nations to make sure Ukraine defends itself, both now and is able to do it in the future as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:58)', 'Speech': 'Senseless war began. I’ve stood with President Zelenskyy, I just spent about an hour with him, both in Washington, [inaudible 00:14:06] and Hiroshima, and now in Vilnius, to declare to the world what I say again, we will not waver. We will not waver. I mean that. Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We’ll stand for liberty and freedom today, tomorrow, and for as long as it takes. We all want this war to end on just terms, terms that uphold the basic principles of the United Nations Charter that we all signed up to, sovereignty, territorial integrity. These are two pillars of peaceful relations among nations. One country cannot be allowed to seize its neighbor’s territory by force. Russia could end this war tomorrow by withdrawing its forces in Ukraine, recognizing international borders, and ceasing its inhumane attacks on Russia. I mean, by Russia on Ukraine, against its children, women and children, its military.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:17)', 'Speech': 'Unfortunately, Russia has shown thus far no interest in a diplomatic outcome. Putin still wrongly believes that he can outlast Ukraine. He can’t believe it’s their land, their country and their future, and even after all this time, Putin still doubts our staying power. He’s still making a bad bet that the conviction and the unity among the United States and our allies and partners will break down. He still doesn’t understand that our commitment, our vows, our freedom is something he can never, never, ever, ever walk away from. It’s who we are. I mean that. It’s who we are. It’s who we are. Throughout this horrific war, the people in Lithuania, together with our Baltic brethren, have been among the most fierce champions of Ukraine’s right to a future of its own choosing. One that is free. Because you live so long with freedom denied, many of you who are older know better than anyone how precious the right to determine your future is. Precious to people everywhere. Everywhere. Not just in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, and all places around the world where people continue to fight to make their voices heard.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:36)', 'Speech': 'So my message to all the united is, keep it up. Keep it going. Keep reminding the world of hope that Lithuania embodies. And that’s what you embody, hope, in this country. And I really mean it. I’m not joking. I mean this sincerely. You must never forget how much this matters, and never, never give up on a better tomorrow. The defensive freedom is not the work of a day or a year, it’s the calling of our lifetime, of all time. We are steel for the struggle ahead. Our unity will not falter, I promise you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:18)', 'Speech': 'Folks, as I look around the world today at a moment of war and peril, a moment of competition and uncertainty, I also see a moment of unprecedented opportunity. Unprecedented opportunity. Opportunity to make real strides for the world of greater peace and greater prosperity, liberty and dignity, equal justice under the law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are the blessing and birthright of all of humanity. That is the world the United States is working toward, and it’s one we’ll only reach if we do it together. And I mean together. We need to take the same spirit of unity, common purpose, determination that we have demonstrated in our response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, and bring more partners along as we continue working to build a world we want to live in and the world we want for our children.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:19)', 'Speech': 'My friends, at the most fundamental level, we face a choice. It’s not hyperbole. We face a choice. A choice between the world defined by coercion and exploitation where might makes right, or a world where we recognize that our own success is bound to the success of others. When others do better, we do better as well. Where we understand that the challenges we face today from the existential threat of climate change, to building a global economy where no one gets left behind are too great for any one nation to solve on their own. And that, to achieve our goals and meet the challenges in this age, we have to work together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:03)', 'Speech': 'And I mean this sincerely. The world’s changing. We have a chance to change the dynamic. That’s why I’ve been so focused as President on rebuilding and revitalizing the alliances that are the cornerstone of American leadership and the world. These past years, we’ve brought the Transatlantic Partnership to new heights, reaffirming the importance of the relationship between Europe and the United States as an anchor to global stability. The idea that the United States could prosper without a secure Europe is not reasonable. And it really isn’t. It’s not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:32)', 'Speech': 'We’re also elevating a deeper American alliance in the Indo-Pacific with Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, which provide critical security and deterrence in that vital region of the world. Through our quad partnership, that’s a fancy way of saying our partnership with Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, we’re bringing major democracies of the region together to cooperate, keeping Indo-Pacific free and open, prosperous and secure. We’ve demonstrated during this NATO summit with Indo-Pacific partners joining us for the second year in a row, we’re working to deep en connection between the Atlantic and Pacific democracies, so that we can better work together toward the shared values we all seek. Strong alliances, versatile partnerships, common purpose, collective action to meet our shared challenges.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:36)', 'Speech': 'The world has shrunk. That’s how we build a future to save, that we share and know we share challenges, and work together. We have to step up together, building the broadest and deepest coalition to strengthen and defend the basic rules of the road, to preserve all the extraordinary benefits that stem from the international system, grounded in the rule of law. We have to come together to protect the rights and freedoms, to underwrite the flow of ideas in commerce, in which have enabled decades of global growth. Yes, territorial integrity and sovereignty, but also principles like freedom of navigation and overflight. Keeping our share of seas and skies open so that every nation has equal access to our global common space.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:29)', 'Speech': 'And as we continue to explore this age of new possibilities, an age enabled by rapid advances in innovation, we have to stand together to ensure that the common spaces of our future reflect our highest aspirations for ourselves and for others. As my dad would say, that everybody is treated with some dignity. So that artificial intelligence, engineering, biology, and other engineering and emerging technologies are not made into weapons of oppression, but rather they’re used as tools of opportunity. Working with our allies and partners to build supply chains that are more resilient, more secure, so we never again faced a situation like we had during the pandemic where we couldn’t get critical goods we needed for our daily lives. We’re all the sum of the common will, to actually address the existential threat of accelerating climate change. It’s real. It’s serious. We don’t have a lot of time. It is the single greatest threat to humanity. It’s only by our working together that we’ll prevent the worst consequences of climate change from ravaging our future, and that of our children and grandchildren.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:46)', 'Speech': 'We also have to recognize our shared responsibility to help unlock the enormous potential that exists in low and middle income companies around the world. Not out of charity, but because it’s in our own self-interest. We all benefit when more partners stand together working towards shared goals. We all benefit when people are healthier and more prosperous. And that’s not, again, hyperbole, it’s true. We all benefit when more entrepreneurs and innovators are able to pursue their dreams for a better tomorrow. So we need to update our tool set. Better address the needs of today in this interconnected world, a world where climate disasters, pandemics, conflicts, spill over borders and make it harder to address the challenges of poverty and instability that holds so many people back. That’s why the United States is leading an effort to transform the multilateral development of banks, like the World Bank. Help them better address their global challenges while enhancing their core mission of reducing poverty and boost shared prosperity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:54)', 'Speech': 'We’re all working together with our partners in the G7 to address the enormous needs for high standard infrastructure around the world, especially in low and middle income companies in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. It’s a statement about the world we want to build together. Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at an inflection point, an inflection point in history where the choices we make now are going to shape the direction of our world for decades to come. The world has changed. Will we turn back naked, unchecked aggression today to deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow? Will we staunch the climate crisis before it’s too late? Will we harness the new technologies to advance freedom, or will we diminish it? Will we advance opportunity in more places that allow instability and equality to persist? How we answer these essential questions is literally going to determine the kind of future our children and grandchildren have. And again, that’s not an exaggeration, it’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:05)', 'Speech': 'It’s going to take all of us. All of us. I believe that with ambition and confidence in ourselves and one another, with the nation’s working together for common cause, we can answer these questions. We can ensure the vision we share and the freedom we cherish are not just empty words in a troubled time, but a roadmap. I mean this literally. A roadmap, a plan of urgent action for the future we can reach, but reach if we work together. Folks, the road that lies before us is hard. It will challenge us to summon the best of ourselves, to hold faith in one another and never give up, never lose hope. Never. Every day we have to make the choice. Every day we must summon the strength to stand for what is right, to stand for what is true, to stand for freedom, to stand together. That, my friends, is a lesson we’ve learned from history and the history of Lithuania’s story.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:10)', 'Speech': 'It’s the lesson we see demonstrated each day and it will determine what Ukraine looks like. And now it’s in how we’re going to work, how we rewrite the future of peace and hope, justice and light liberty possibility for everyone. Everyone, everywhere. Folks, some have heard me say in my country many times, never, ever in my entire career have I been more optimistic about the prospects of the future. Never. Never. Let me just say, thank you for taking the time to be here to listen. God bless you all and may God protect the freedoms of Ukraine, here, and every nation of the world, everywhere. God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

And ways to protect the rights of Americans. Over the past year, my Administration has taken action to guide responsible innovation. Last October, we introduced the first of its kind AI Bill of Rights. In February, I signed an executive order to direct agency to protect the public from algorithms that discriminate. In May, we unveiled a new strategy to establish seven new AI research institutes to help drive breakthroughs in responsible AI intervention. And today, I’m pleased to announce that these seven companies have agreed to voluntary commitments for responsible innovation. These commitments which the companies will implement immediately underscore three fundamental principles, safety, security, and trust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:01)', 'Speech': 'First, the companies have an obligation to make sure their technology is safe, before releasing it to the public. That means testing the capabilities of their systems, assessing their potential risk, and making the results of these assessments public. Second, companies must prioritize the security of their systems by safeguarding their models against cyber threats, and managing the risk to our national security, and sharing the best practices and industry standards that are necessary. Third, the companies have a duty to earn the people’s trust and empower users to make informed decisions. Labeling content that has been altered or AI generated, rooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections, and shielding children from harm.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:51)', 'Speech': 'And finally, companies have agreed to find ways for AI to help meet society’s greatest challenges, from cancer to climate change, and invest in education and new jobs, to help students and workers prosper from the opportunities. And there are enormous opportunities of AI. These commitments are real and they’re concrete. They’re going to help fulfill… Industry, fulfill its fundamental obligation to Americans to develop safe, secure, and trustworthy technologies that benefits society, and uphold our values and our shared values.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:23)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. We’ll see more technology change in the next 10 years, or even in the next few years, than we’ve seen in the last 50 years. That has been an astounding revelation to me, quite frankly. Artificial intelligence is going to transform the lives of people around the world. The group here will be critical in shepherding that innovation with responsibility, and safety by design to earn the trust of Americans. And quite frankly, as I met with world leaders, all our… All the G7 is focusing on the same thing. Social media has shown us the harm that powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place. And I’ve said at the State of the Union that Congress needs to pass bipartisan legislation and impose strict limits on personal data collection, ban targeted advertisements to kids, require companies to put health and safety first.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:18)', 'Speech': 'But we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats of emerging technologies that can pose, don’t have to, but can pose to our democracy and our values. Americans have seen how advanced artificial intelligence, and the pace of innovation have the power to disrupt jobs and industries. These commitments are a promising step, but that we have a lot more work to do together. Realizing the promise of AI by managing the risk, is going to require some new laws, regulations, and oversight. In the weeks ahead, I’m going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation. And we’re going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:04)', 'Speech': 'I’m pleased that leaders, Schumer and leaders Jeffries and others in the Congress are making this a top bipartisan priority. As we advance the agenda here at home, we’ll lead work with our allies and partners on a common international framework to govern the development of AI. And I thank these leaders in the room with me today, and their partnership, excuse me, and their commitments that they’re making. This is a serious responsibility. We have to get it right, and there’s enormous, enormous potential upside as well. So I want to thank you all, and they’re about to go down to a meeting, which I’ll catch up with them later.

Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Act. It was the last act he signed before his death. This act reflected his belief that every person deserved to be treated with dignity and respect, and that people with mental illnesses and addictions should be able to receive high quality services in their community close to home, not just be housed in a hospital or a jail because care wasn’t available. Unfortunately, his vision was not realized for decades until now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:10)', 'Speech': 'When President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, he created the largest investment in community behavioral health services ever made in our country. And I want to personally thank President Biden for being with us as a champion every step of the way to get this done. And I’m not talking about grants that start and stock. This is full Medicaid funding for clinics that meet high quality standards. The same model used for federally qualified health centers that do such a wonderful job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:09)', 'Speech': 'In other words, for the first time, we are transforming our healthcare system to fund healthcare above the neck as well as healthcare below the neck as my friend Patrick Kennedy always says. This transformation began 10 years ago on the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy’s bill signing. When my partner, and I mean true partner, Senator Roy Blunt and I went to the floor of the United States Senate to speak and to introduce our bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act. What followed was a 10-year bipartisan journey to show that providing high quality community services including 24-hour psychiatric emergency services was not only the right thing to do for people, but the cost-effective thing to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:15)', 'Speech': 'Our 10 demonstration state program has had amazing results from 68% fewer emergency room visits to 60% fewer people sitting in jail. And you know who loves that? Our sheriffs and our police chiefs who want people to get care and not just sit in their jail. A 33% decrease in homelessness, a 74% reduction in hospitalization. Right now we have over 500 community behavioral health clinics across America and more are coming. And the next 10 states to receive full Medicaid funding will be chosen in the next few months.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:57)', 'Speech': 'Let me just say, when someone walks into one of the 34 clinics currently in Michigan, imagine this, they call, they walk in, one-third of the time, they’re seen the same day, the same day. Everyone is seen within 10 days. No more waiting for months and months when you finally get to a point where you want to deal with your addiction, when you finally are at a point where you know you need to deal with your depression or your child desperately needs help. Which brings us to today, we know that funding behavioral healthcare like any other healthcare works and requiring insurance companies to do the same thing works.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:48)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank President Biden again for his vision, his commitment, and his compassion for people every day and for taking another very important step today to strengthen the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Step by step. Step by step we are transforming our healthcare system together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:23)', 'Speech': 'And now I’d like to introduce someone who understands firsthand the importance of access to behavioral healthcare. Rachelle Keyes is a leader with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She lives in Stafford, Virginia. She has a daughter, Katrina. Seven years ago at age 15, Katrina suffered a significant mental health crisis and spent time in the hospital. She will share the story. Rachelle wanted to focus on helping her daughter get well. That’s all any of us would want. Instead, she ended up fighting with her insurance company to get coverage. Thank you, Rachelle, for your advocacy and your voice. Please welcome Rachelle Keys.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:58)', 'Speech': 'We finally found an out-of-network specialist, but she was expensive. After several visits, knowing how costly it was for us, she did something extraordinary. She offered to join our health plans network. I just needed insurance to agree and accept it. I submitted all the right forms. I was really hopeful. Then the dreaded response, denied. They said there were plenty of in-network providers, it didn’t matter that none of them had the right experience for my kid or that she had a therapist who was helping her and willing to be in-network for her care. I appealed. Denied again. I asked, “What more did I need to do?” They said she needs to see two or three of their in-network providers, and I would have to explain why those therapists weren’t a good fit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:59)', 'Speech': 'Can you imagine if she had cancer and was twice denied life-saving treatment because she hadn’t tried other treatments that we already know were going to fail? I wouldn’t put my daughter through that and risk losing the progress she had made. We continued paying out of pocket. It was hard. But over five years, this heroic therapist saved my daughter’s life multiple times. My daughter is now thriving and I am so proud of her. She’s amazing. Our story could have turned out tragically, and for many families it does.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:50)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Mr. President for prioritizing mental health. There is no health without mental health.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:06)', 'Speech': 'One of the things that the pandemic demonstrated is the need for a lot more help. Over a million people dead from COVID, that’s estimated to mean 8 million people left behind who were close to them. How many mornings people get up or show up for dinner and there’s an empty chair? The impact on people’s lives is profound. And you were paying insurance every month. You know, you shouldn’t be your own… Well, you shouldn’t have to do what you had to do, going through one of the hardest things in life.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:52)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, Debbie, Debbie, Debbie, God love you. You’re the best, Debbie. You really are. We wouldn’t be here if it we’re not for Debbie. That’s not an [inaudible 00:12:02]. I’ve served together for a long time in the Senate and I’ve never known you not to be a significant advocate for this very issue. And I want to thank Acting Secretary Su and everyone in the Department of Labor and HHS and Treasury for working in improving insurance coverage for mental health care in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:30)', 'Speech': 'And folks, I don’t know what the difference between breaking your arm and having a mental breakdown is. It’s health. There’s no distinction. It’s health. Vivek Murthy, who’s our surgeon general, and I talk about this issue a lot.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:48)', 'Speech': 'In the last two State of the Union addresses, I’ve laid out what I call the Unity Agenda. It’s made up of four big things that we’re going to do together as a nation. One of the things I’m always asked is why Americas have sort of lost faith for a while on being able to do big things. “If you could do anything at all, Joe, what would you do?” I said, “I’d cure cancer.” And they looked at me like, “Why cancer?” Because no one thinks we can. That’s why. And we can, the end of cancer as we know it. Deliver on our sacred obligations to veterans was the second thing I think is critically important. Thirdly was beat the opioid epidemic, which we’re still fighting very hard. And fourth was to tackle mental health crisis, which is why we’re here today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:37)', 'Speech': 'We can all agree mental healthcare is healthcare. It is healthcare. It’s essential to people’s wellbeing and their ability to lead a full and productive life, to find joy, to find purpose, to take care of themselves and their loved ones. It’s about dignity. Think about this. My dad used to have an expression. “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity.” Imagine being a parent looking at your beautiful child you adore, needing help and know you can’t do a damn thing about it. You don’t have the wherewithal. You can’t talk about stripping a parent of their dignity, their inability to help their child or their husband or their wife or their mother or their father or someone they adore.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:20)', 'Speech': 'But right now, for millions of Americans, mental health care and treatment for substance abuse is out of reach. It’s out of reach. In 2020, less than half, less than half of all adults with mental illness diagnosis received care for it. Less than half. For children, the numbers are even worse. Nearly 70% of our kids who seek care for mental health or addiction cannot get it. 70%. Talk to parents and teachers. Talk to the school nurses and counselors. Talk to young people. They’ll tell you there’s a serious youth mental health crisis happening right now in this country. We must fulfill the promise of true mental health parity for all Americans now. Now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:07)', 'Speech': 'Now I might note parenthetically, if we do, it saves the country billions of dollars, the idea that it saves. Here’s what it means. Almost 15 years ago, the Bipartisan of Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act became law. You call for health insurance companies to cover mental health care and treatment for substance abuse at the same levels of physical healthcare. Because just like when you break a bone or you have a heart attack, when you’re having a mental health crisis, you should be able to get help, medical help, professional help. During the Obama-Biden administration, we worked hard to put this law into effect. And the result by some important measures, there is greater parity, not nearly a greater parity today than in the past.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:07)', 'Speech': 'Look, there’s lower copays for mental healthcare, getting rid of some arbitrary limits on the number of times you can see your therapist each year. Plus, for the first time ever, the Affordable Care Act made mental health care in essential service, which means many health plans must cover it. These were important steps, but they weren’t enough. We’re still not where we need to be. We’re still not there. Insurers still make it far too difficult to get mental health care. Their networks of providers are badly inadequate with far fewer psychiatrists, therapists, and other mental health professionals compared to all other medical specialties.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:49)', 'Speech': 'Now as a result, even with private insurance, patients are often forced to seek out-of-network care at significantly higher cost if they can find it. Seeing a therapist can cost 200 bucks a visit or more. That’s $800 a month if you have a session every week, which is often what patients need. Many families, significant number of families cannot afford that. And by the way, think about parent. Think about just how difficult it is to begin with to say, “I need help.” You break your arm, you have no trouble going to emergency. “I need help.” You’re having a mental crisis. It’s hard. It’s hard to say, “I need help. I need help. My child needs help.” And this is happening to millions of people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:40)', 'Speech': 'People with insurance are twice as likely to have to go out of network for mental healthcare compared to physical healthcare. And that gap has only gotten wider. As a result, folks with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, addiction and other illnesses often go without care. Period. And you know how that ends many times. They try to power through and hope they can manage on their own or they pay whatever it takes, spending down their savings, racking up credit card bills, or taking out second or third mortgages to get the care for themselves or their children. Folks, it shouldn’t be this way. It doesn’t need to be this way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:24)', 'Speech': 'I’ve heard from mental health professionals across the country describing a system that’s falling short. One therapist wrote me, who primarily treats teenagers including some or having suicidal thoughts, and he said when his patients need to be hospitalized to save their lives, insurance companies often deny the claims, often deny the claims. Another clinical psychologist wrote me and described getting calls from desperate people who’ve called 20 different therapists looking for help but can’t find it. This therapist says, and I quote, “I try to create time that I don’t have to see more patients.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:00)', 'Speech': '“I’m often the only person,” he went on to say, “who is able to call them back. They never even get calls most of the time.” And I personally received letters from family members whose loved ones are suffering from mental illness, who describe how difficult it can be to help. One woman wrote me and went on to say about her mother, retired teacher who has a bipolar disorder. Her daughter wrote, “Too often, insurance companies dictate the standard of care when it actually needs to be care providers and family members who have more to say.” She went on to say, “Please advocate hard for the most vulnerable among us.” Well, that’s exactly what my administration is trying to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:44)', 'Speech': 'Today, my administration is announcing new steps to dramatically expand access to mental healthcare in America. Our plans would require health insurance plans to identify the gaps in the mental health care that they provide. For example, they need to measure how many mental health providers are in their network, how much they are paying these providers, how difficult it’s for someone to join their network, how often doctors have to get the so-called prior authorization before they can treat a patient. Some of you have dealt with this more than once. You get referrals to see mental health specialists, but when you make the appointment they say, “I can’t see you until your doctor submits the paperwork and get special permission from the insurance company.” Give me a break. It’s ridiculous. It really is. It’s ridiculous to prevent people from getting the care they need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:44)', 'Speech': 'Now, insurance companies, now insurance are going to have to measure how often they require prior authorization and how often they deny those requests. Right now, many health plans don’t collect data. Under my administration’s new plan, they would be required to collect that data. None of the existing law when facts reveal that mental healthcare is not being treated on par with physical healthcare, they’d be required by law to fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:19)', 'Speech': 'Here’s something else we’re announcing today. When the Mental Health Parity Act was passed 15 years ago, there was a loophole. Health plans that are offered to state and local government employees did not have to comply with the Mental Health Parity Act. More than 200 health plans nationwide were left out. Now we’re making it clear, they have to follow the law as well. They must follow the law as well. This builds on the work we’ve done over the past two years. We’ve expanded certified community behavioral health clinics. And I want to thank Debbie again, who for years worked to get this program up and running. She made sure it was funded in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which I was proud to sign the law. The largest investment in mental health ever, ever, ever, ever. Thank you, Debbie.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:24)', 'Speech': 'These clinics provide a range of service including crisis support available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. And they serve anyone who needs care regardless of the ability to pay. They’re now 500 of these clinics in 46 states. We’ve added more than 140 during my administration. And we’re going to keep increasing the number because you need more than the 500. We’ve also launched a nationwide crisis hotline, 988. Let me say that again. The Crisis hotline is 988, where you can connect with the trained crisis counselor 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Over 5 million people have called that hotline since I launched it a year ago. 5 million. And we say we don’t have a problem?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:06)', 'Speech': 'We’ve invested $1 billion to help schools hire, train, and train 14,000 new mental health counselors in schools across the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:22)', 'Speech': 'And we’re taking steps to address the harm of social media is doing to our young people, and it is doing harm. We’ve got to hold these platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. Later this week, senators will debate legislation to protect kids’ privacy online, which I’ve been calling for for two years. It matters. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. I really mean it. Think about it. You ever get a chance to look at what your kids are looking at online?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:57)', 'Speech': 'Folks, the actions we’re announcing today represent a real step forward to help millions of people get mental healthcare they need, and the insurance should be provided. It should be provided. But there’s still so much more to do. Improving our mental health system means addressing the three Cs, coverage, care, and causes. Today we took a big step in coverage. Now we need to keep expanding care. For example, by increasing access to telemedicine, expanding our mental health workforce, doctors, therapists, and counselors. Expanding it. We need to address prevention and the root cause of the pain and trauma that a lot of people are feeling like loneliness and isolation. Social media and online bullying, gun violence. And we’re still feeling the profound loss of the pandemic. As I mentioned, over 100 people dead. That’s 100 empty chairs around the kitchen table. Every single loss, there are so many people left behind and broken-hearted.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:06)', 'Speech': 'Folks, this mental health crisis is something we need to face together as a country. We have a moral obligation, in my view, to be there for each other, to reach out, reach to our neighbors and grief and stress and trauma and despair, reach out to them to offer help or just a listening ear, to have the courage to ask for help when we need it and it’s hard, because we know that even when it feels as dark as it can get, we aren’t alone. It’s important for people to realize they’re not alone. That’s what I want for everyone in America, not to feel isolated and alone, to know their country has their back and their president has their back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:51)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. Many people have to seek mental health care at some point in their lives. Whether you’re in a red state, a blue state, it doesn’t matter. Mental health care can be life changing and even lifesaving. For all those brave enough and strong enough to seek help, and I mean that, brave enough and strong enough to seek help, we have to do better. Together I know we will. We just have to remember who we are for God’s sake. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much.'}]"

So many leaders here today made that progress possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:00)', 'Speech': 'Our history as a nation is born of tragedy and triumph, of struggle and success.

And as people who love our country, as patriots, we know that we must remember and teach our full history even when it is painful, especially when it is painful.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:28)', 'Speech': 'Today, there are those in our nation who would prefer to erase or even rewrite the ugly parts of our past. Those who attempt to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery, those who insult us in an attempt to gaslight us, who tried to divide our nation with unnecessary debates. Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:02)', 'Speech': 'We will be better, if we remember, we will be stronger if we remember, because we all here know it is only by understanding and learning from our past that we can continue to work together to build a better future.

And Reverend Wheeler Parker Jr. just also shared with me that he and his wife will be celebrating this weekend. They’re 56th anniversary of marriage. Reverend Wheeler Parker Jr.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:19)', 'Speech': 'It has been quite a journey for me from the darkness to the light. When I sat with my family on the night of terror, when Emmett Till our beloved Bobo was taken from us, taken to be tortured, brutally murdered. Back then, when I was overwhelmed with terror and fear of certain death in the darkness of a thousand midnights, in a pitch black house on what some have called dark fear road. Back then in the darkness, I could never imagine a moment like this standing in the light of wisdom, grace and deliverance.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:02)', 'Speech': 'There’s something amazing you feel when you meet President Biden, like I did when he signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Bill into law, he welcomed me to this place of great power. I felt the power of his personal devotion, his devotion to justice, to equality, his commitment to keeping the promise of America. This came from his heart, from his soul.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:30)', 'Speech': 'God bless you, President Biden, for all you have done and will do to preserve our history. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in recognizing President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:25)', 'Speech': 'To all the members of Congress, including Representative Bennie Thompson, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Representative Danny Davis and Senator Dick Durbin, we wish you speedy recovery from COVID. He’s just recovering from COVID right now. And who have long fought to honor the Till family. It’s not new to any of them. To the Till family, it’s an honor to be with you again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:51)', 'Speech': 'When I was preparing these remarks, I quite frankly, and my colleagues will understand this, I found myself trying to temper my anger as I was writing it. I’m not joking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:09)', 'Speech': 'I can’t fathom what it must have been like. It’s hard to believe I was 12 years old and I just know no matter how much time has passed, how many birthdays, how many events, how many anniversaries, it’s hard to relive this. It brings it all back. We were talking about, Rev, as if it happened yesterday. The images in your head, things you remember. But it’s inspiring to see how many of your family have continued as mother’s courage to find faith in pain, purpose in pain. That’s a remarkable thing, it seems to me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:57)', 'Speech': 'Insisting on an open casket for her murdered and I might add, maimed and mutilated son. 14 years old, 14 years old. She said, “Let the people see what I’ve seen. Let the people see what I have seen.” My God, all of us have lost children in other ways.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:25)', 'Speech': 'How hard it is even to close the casket or keep it open or what a debate it is. But to see the child that had been maimed and the country and the world saw. And I just heard the story of Emmett Till and his mother, as a story of a family’s promise and loss and the nation’s reckoning with hate, violence, racism, overwhelming abuse of power, brutality. It’s hard to fathom there’s even a war, for me. It’s hard to fathom.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:09)', 'Speech': 'But today on what would’ve been Emmett’s 82nd birthday, we add another chapter to the story of remembrance and healing. Just as we joined together when I signed the law in his name to make lynching a federal crime, think how long that took for that to happen. And we screened the movie Till at the White House.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:39)', 'Speech': 'Today we join together as I sign a proclamation designating Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in both Illinois and in Mississippi.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:55)', 'Speech': 'When we ended lynching as a matter of law, we talked about wanting to do this, but the support from the community, it’s been so overwhelming. I thank the members of Congress for their support and more than that, their leadership, at a time when there are those who seek to ban books, bury history, we’re making it clear, crystal clear.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:45)', 'Speech': 'All darkness and denialism can hide much, they erase nothing. You can hide, but they erase nothing. We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know. We have to learn what we should know. We should know about our country. We should know everything, the good, the bad, the truth of who we are as a nation. That’s what great nations do. And we are a great nation. That’s what they do. For only with truth comes healing, justice, repair, and another step forward toward forming a more perfect union. We’ve got a hell of a long way to go.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:26)', 'Speech': 'That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s going to happen with visitors of all backgrounds. To learn the history of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley through our national monument. Look, telling the truth and the full history of our nation is important. It’s important to our children, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren, to our nation as a whole. I’ve said it before, it was a lesson I learned of coming out of, not like real leaders in the Civil Rights Movement but when I came out of the Civil Rights movement as a kid, as a public defender.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:05)', 'Speech': 'And I used to think that you pass something that was good, you can make hate go away. Hate never goes away. It just hides. It hides under the rocks and give it a little bit of oxygen by bad people, it comes roaring out again. And it’s up to all of us to deal with that, up to all of us to stop it, up to all of us. The best way to do this is with the truth. It’s used in a different context, but I think it applies here. Silence is complicity. I will not be silent, nor will you be silent about what happened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:58)', 'Speech': 'There’s really critical work ahead to continue the fight for racial justice and equality for all Americans. And my administration is committed to leading the path forward. And I know the members of Congress here are even more committed than that. I’m going to close with this.

This is our home and we are committed to its protection. We are forever grateful to the President for his commitment to protect our homelands for the tribes and everyone who recognizes the beauty of the Grand Canyon. It is a privilege to welcome all the tribal leaders, congressional leaders, and White House staff to our homelands. It is now my honor to introduce a true leader pursuing environmental justice, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:31)', 'Speech': 'It is great to be here. Secretary Holland, our first Native American Cabinet secretary, and Brenda Mallory, the chair of our Council of Environmental Quality, and Governor Hobbs, congratulations and you’re doing a heck of a job. And Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Congressman, where’s the congressman? Is he here? We’ve been hanging out since I got here a little bit. Raul has been a good friend and done a great deal. He was one of the most popular congressmen in the country I think, who’ve long championed this effort in Congress. And Congressman Greg Stanton has been a leader as well. And thanks to all the state, county and local officials who’ve worked so hard to see this day happen. Make it happen. And you have, believe me, I know you have. To the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management Professionals here, thank you. Thank you for caring for our public lands, most precious thing we have. And special thanks to tribal leaders joining us whose ancestors stewarded these lands since time in memorial. Got to meet most of you last night. I’m looking forward to saying hello to you again today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:39)', 'Speech': 'And a special hello to Jimmy McCain. Where are you Jimmy? I’m going to embarrass you. He doesn’t think he’s going to be introduced. There you are Jimmy. Jimmy’s dad was a dear friend of mine. We were like two brothers who we got along together. When we argued, we argued like hell. We really went at it. But he was a man, he was a great patriot and a man of enormous integrity. And Jimmy, you’re just like your dad. Serving your country in Iraq and Afghanistan and continuing to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. Thank you, thank you, thank you pal. And I say this is all sincerity. No one ever doubts I mean what I say, sometimes I say all that I mean though. I think of your dad all the time about how much he loved this country and how optimistic he was. Optimistic about our future. So thank you for being here, pal and thank you for your continued service.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:36)', 'Speech': 'America’s natural wonders are nation’s, heart and soul. That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. They unite us. They inspire us. A birthright we pass down from generation to generation, and that’s why from day one, I’ve taken historic steps to conserve our natural treasures for all ages. My first week as President, I signed an executive order established in our country’s most ambitious conservation goal ever. I made a commitment that we will protect 30% of all our nation’s lands and waters, conserve all 30% of all our nation’s lands and waters by 2030, and we’re on our way and we’re delivering. Just my first year in office, we’ve protecting more lands than anyone since the 1960s. John Kennedy’s era. 9 million acres in Alaska, in Bristol Bay and the Tongass Forest, 225,000 acres in Minnesota, the Boundary Waters. We’re working to protect 770,000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean, Southwest of Hawaii, a new maritime sanctuary, and network of islands and reefs, almost three times the size of Texas on track to be among the largest protected ocean area on the entire planet.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:00)', 'Speech': 'We’ve already restored protection for three natural monuments gutted by the last administration. Two not so far from here in Utah, the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears. By the way, I’ll never forget, I was standing in Washington and a little girl walked up to me, I could see her daddy say, “Go up and say something to the President. She walked up and she said, “Mr. President, would you take care of Bears Ears for me?” And I didn’t know what she meant when she said it. “Would you take care of Bear’s Ears for me?” Well, we took care of her and we gave her the signing pen. A third of the coast of New England and the northeast canyons and sea mounts. Look, we’ve designated new national monuments as well. Camp Hale in Colorado, 50,000 acres, Spirit Mountain in Nevada, 500,000 acres, Castner Range in Texas, 6,600 acres. And just last month honoring Emmett Till and his mother Mamie Till-Mobley in Mississippi and in Illinois.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:03)', 'Speech': 'But folks, it’s not hyperbole suggested, there is no national treasure, none that is grander than the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, one of the earth’s nine wonders, wonders of the world. Literally. Think of that. It’s amazing. And during symbol of America to the entire world, the first time I saw the Grand Canyon years ago, I was a young senator. As I stood there and looked out, a phrase came to mind. It was instinctive. I said, “This is God’s cathedral.” That’s what it reminded me of. It just is so magnificent. As a matter of fact, I said nine. It’s one of the seven wonders of the world. And so today, I’m proud to use my authority under the Antiquities Act to protect almost one million acres of public land around Grand Canyon National Park as a new national monument.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:03)', 'Speech': 'To help right the wrongs of the past and conserve this land of ancestral footprints for all future generations. Over the years, hundreds of millions of people have traveled to the Grand Canyon. Odd by its majesty, but fewer are aware of its full history. From time in memorial, more than a dozen tribal nations have lived, gathered, preyed on these lands. But some 100 years ago they were forced out. That very act of preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny indigenous people full access to their homelands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:48)', 'Speech': 'To the places where they hunted, gathered, took precious sacred ancestral sites. They fought for decades to be able to return to these lands, to protect these lands from mining and development, to clear them of contamination, to preserve their shared legacy for future generations. I made a commitment as President to prioritize respect for the tribal sovereignty and self-determination to honor the solemn promises the United States made to tribal nations to fulfill federal trust and treaty obligations. I pledge to keep using all that available authority to protect sacred tribal lands. Biden administration has worked alongside tribal leaders, including many of you are here today, to keep that promise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:41)', 'Speech': 'At a time when some seek to ban books and bury history, we’re making it clear that we can’t just choose to learn only what we want to know. We should learn everything that’s good, bad, and the truth, about who we are as a nation. That’s what great nations do, and we’re the greatest of all nations. Only with truth comes healing and justice, and another step toward forming more perfect union. Folks, our nation’s history is etched in our people and in our lands. Today’s action is going to protect and preserve that history along with these high plateaus and deep canyons. Majestic red cliffs over 300 million years old. Older than the oldest dinosaur ever known. Central to the creation stories of so many tribal people and so many tribal nations, fundamental to who we are, to their way of life, to the most sacred ceremonies, ancestors buried here, eternal sources of reverence and healing. These lands also supported a range of ecosystem and plants. From Savannah’s to Sagebrush to Ponderosa Pine, a haven of ironic species like bats, bison, bighorn sheep, and nearly 450 kinds of birds, including the bald and golden eagles.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:11)', 'Speech': 'They’re the historic home of 3000 cultural sites, cliff houses, cave paintings. Ancient spots that help us understand the history of these civilizations. They also are key to building resilience to drought and climate change. Creeks and streams flowing into the Colorado River, supporting farms and ranches across the southwest, bringing clean water to 40 million Americans. By creating this monument, we’re setting aside new spaces for families to hike, bike, hunt, fish and camp. Growing the tourism economy that already accounts for 11% of all Arizona jobs. Folks, preserving these lands is good, not only for Arizona, for the planet, it’s good for the economy, it’s good for the soul of the nation. And I believe with my core and my course the right thing to do. But there’s more work ahead to combat the existential threat of climate change.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:17)', 'Speech': 'We’ve seen historic floods, more intense droughts, wildfires, spreading smokey haze, which I could sense today, thousands of miles. Record temperatures affecting more than 100 million Americans this summer. I need not tell you, all over 110 degrees in Phoenix for 31 straight days. Extreme heat is America’s number one weather related killer. Extreme heat kills more people than floods, hurricanes and tornadoes combined, and it’s threatening the farms, the forests, and the fisheries of so many families depend on to make a living. But none of this need to be inevitable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:05)', 'Speech': 'From the start of my administration, we’ve taken an unprecedented action to combat climate crisis. Last year I signed the largest climate bill in the history, not only of the United States, but literally in the history of the world. It’s the biggest investment in climate conservation and environmental justice ever, anywhere, in the history of the world. And it has many parts. For example, it’ll save working families thousands of dollars a year if they install rooftop solar or weatherize their homes and also conserve energy. And it includes the record $720 million for native communities to ease the impact of droughts and rising sea levels, to bring clean electricity to tribal homes. And all these historic measures put us on track to cut all American emissions in half. In half by 2030. And we’re well on our way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:14)', 'Speech': 'It also creates enormous of employment, enormous growth in things that better people’s lives. My mom, God love her, had an expression, when I lost my family, she said, “Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.” Well, there’s a lot of good that’s going to come from the sacrifices of dealing with taking on the climate crisis. Folks, these are investments on our planet, our people, in America itself, protecting our outdoor treasures, making our nation more resilient. But some MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo it all. I didn’t get any help from the guys on the other team. Every single solitary person voted against this historic clean energy investment. And now many of them are trying again to repeal these parts of the bills, but we won’t let them. There’s too much at stake.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:08)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. America’s natural wonders are central to our heritage and our identity as a nation. Conserving them not only protects the livelihoods of the people who depend on them, preserves key pieces of our history of the full American story for generations to come. It unites us through all ages and connects us to something bigger than ourselves, much bigger than ourselves. Today marks an historic step in preserving the majesty of this place. First among American landmarks, sacred to tribal nations, revered by every American. It speaks to the soul of our nation, reminds us of who we are. We are the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. Nothing at all.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:09)', 'Speech': 'Well folks, God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Now I want to invite some of our guests on stage. I think they know who they’re supposed to come up, as I sign the proclamation establishing ancestral footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:27)', 'Speech': 'I wonder who’s going to be the first one to walk a million acres?

We’re investing $60 million, we’re creating jobs, we’re ramping up production in another two facilities of Arcosa, and I think we’re just getting started.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:03)', 'Speech': 'So on behalf of the 6,000 employees of Arcosa and the communities where we are, I want to thank President Biden for pushing through this legislation and making it happen. I also want to thank Senator Heinrich, Senator Lujan, and Governor Lujan Grisham for being here, and also our great friends and partners from GIV or Nova who made it happen also. So thank you very much. And with that, it’s my honor to introduce the person who has made today possible, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:22)', 'Speech': 'Representative Stansbury, God love you, kid. I tell you what, you are really doing a great job. Thank you for all your cooperation and thanks for your advice and your help. And Teresa Leger Fernandez, who isn’t here today … What am I thinking? I thought you had to leave. By the way, her son there, I tell you what, keep an eye on him. I may be calling him Mr. President someday. I don’t know. Gabe is the one who couldn’t be here today. You have an incredible congressional delegation. You really do here, first rate, you really do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:04)', 'Speech': 'Thanks to all the tribal leaders for being here. I just want you to know, I was raised by a guy most of you don’t know. He’s a wonderful, wonderful man, a great friend. His name was Danny Inouye, and he said, “Joe, it’s Indian Nations.” He taught me early on, early on, but thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done. We had a good day yesterday in your neighboring state, Arizona. I was able to put away just about a million acres of sacred land. That’s good stuff.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:42)', 'Speech': 'I got so tired over the last 15 years, and this is a little story I want to tell you about why … I was telling the team here, I know I don’t look it, but I’ve been around a long time, but I’ve never been more optimistic in my whole career than I am today about America’s prospects in both foreign and domestic policy. Went through an awful long time watching companies the last 15 years decide to invest overseas because labor was cheaper, shutting down factories all across America, all across America. And I asked myself, “Why do we have to put up with that?” We’re sending jobs abroad and importing products at home. We knew we could change that. I just knew we could change that. We have the best workers in the world. And my team and I decided, if you hold here, there’s a law that was passed in the ’30s. It says any money that Congress sends me to dispend, I can insist that it all be spent on American products with American workers. No president has paid much attention to that in either party, but guess what? I’m paying attention. As a simple proposition, I mean this sincere, from the bottom [inaudible 00:07:06], we decided we’re going to invest in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:12)', 'Speech': 'And this company’s a great example. They’re now poised to be the leader in the wind industry, but a few years ago, they were laying off workers because we weren’t investing in them. So we passed a significant climate legislation. Not only it moves us away from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies like wind, but it means we’re going to make things and new technology here in America. And there’s no reason why we can’t do it. We have the best educated, we have the most advanced technology in the world. Why are we not doing that? That’s basically what we’re talking about today when we talk about investing in America. So today, I want to talk about our progress in growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. I came to office determined to move away from trickle- down'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:38)', 'Speech': 'But well look, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal have started to call my plan Bidenomics. Initially, I don’t think they meant it with a great deal of respect. With all due respect to them, our plan is working. It’s working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:58)', 'Speech': 'The economy has grown since I took office. It grew faster in the last quarter than anyone expected, and we created over 13 million brand new jobs since I took office. 13 million in less than three years. 90,000 new jobs right here in New Mexico.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:19)', 'Speech': '800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, 800,000. I know you’re tired of hearing me say this, but where’s it written that America can’t lead the world again in manufacturing because we’re going to do just that. The leading manufacturer in the world. These are facts, it’s not hyperbole. We’ve created more jobs in two years than any president in American history has in four-year term.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:49)', 'Speech': 'Unemployment has been below 4% for the longest period stretch in 50 years of American history. And not only have we recovered all the jobs we lost during the pandemic, we now have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. Because unemployment’s been so low for so long, workers aren’t just finding more jobs, they’re able to look for better jobs at higher pay. And according to the research survey, job satisfaction in America is higher than it’s been in the last 36 years. Look, the share of working age Americans with jobs is as high as it’s been in 20 years. That’s never happened under my predecessor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:36)', 'Speech': 'So where are we now? Well, unemployment is down and so is inflation. Remember all the experts, including some that worked for me, told us that to get inflation under control, we need to lower wages and reduce the number of people working. That’s been sort of gospel. Not a joke. Seriously. Some of you in the audience are economists, you know that. But I never bought it. The problem was too many people are working, or working people are working making too much money. That’s not the problem.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:10)', 'Speech': 'There’s a lot of reasons for inflation is up. First, the pandemic. Second, the war in Ukraine. Third, broken supply chains. Now, one reason we’ve seen inflation fall by two-thirds without losing jobs is we’re seeing corporate profits come back down to earth. We have more to do, but inflation is now at its lowest point in two years. In fact, we have the lowest rate of inflation among the world’s major economies. No other economy, major economy in the world, is inflation as low as we are. It’s down from 9% to 3%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:45)', 'Speech': 'There’s a lot more work to do. I’m not satisfied with where it is. More work ahead. The Washington Post recently suggested in a front page article, I think it’s front page, that, “Republicans may have to find something else to criticize Biden for now that inflation is coming down.” I’m sure they’ll find something.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:04)', 'Speech': 'At the same time, pay for low wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in over two decades, and wages are growing faster than inflation. And we’re continuing to make progress in fixing the supply chain. For example, we couldn’t access semiconductors during the pandemic because the factories making them overseas were shut down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:29)', 'Speech': 'You all know semiconductors are those little small computer chips about the size and end of your fingertip, that effectively everything in our lives, from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, to the most sophisticated weapon system, including the systems that Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories provide for our national security.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:49)', 'Speech': 'America invented these chips. We invented them. We went to the moon. We made them work better. We made them more sophisticated. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40% of those chips, the world’s chips, down to 10%. That’s why I designated and I signed, and I insisted it be written and passed, the Chips and Science Act, exactly almost one year ago today. Very short.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:18)', 'Speech': 'Now, all over the country, semiconductor companies are investing a record billions of dollars. By the way, you know how much has been committed in the Chips and Science Act to be invested in America? $ 230 billion. $230 billion to bring chip production back home in Ohio, New York, Arizona, and right here in New Mexico.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:47)', 'Speech': 'Look, just a few years ago, Intel cut 700 jobs of a semiconductor fab in Rio Rancho. Now they’re expanding their fab with a $3.5 billion investment, creating 700 new jobs, many of which won’t require a college degree. And by the way, of this over $200 billion, they’re building fabs. They’re just called factories. They’re the size of a football field. Not much wider than this. And guess what? Average salary is about 130,000 grand. And guess what? You don’t need a college degree. Make over a hundred thousand dollars is about time. And folks, unions are building the structures as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:34)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, that’s Bidenomics. Since I took office, we’ve attracted over half a trillion dollars. Half a trillion dollars in private investment in manufacturing and industries of the future right here in America. According to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and Wall Street, my Investing in America Agenda is leading to a boom in manufacturing investment. Spending on construction for manufacturing plants nearly doubled in the last two years, after growing only 2% the previous four years. Last quarter, factory construction contributed more to the gross domestic product than any time in 40 years. 40 years. Instead of exporting American jobs, we’re creating American jobs and we’re exporting American products.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:27)', 'Speech': 'And we’re seeing it right here in America. We’re seeing it in New Mexico as well. In 2008, Solo Cup factories shut down right here, right where we’re standing, and 200 people lost their jobs. Nearly a decade and a half later, a plastics company bought the site. It shut down after three years, laying off a hundred workers. It’s been idle ever since. Now it’s coming alive again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:54)', 'Speech': 'Arcosa makes wind turbines, wind towers. That’s the thing that holds…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:39)', 'Speech': 'A few years ago, business took a turn and they were forced to lay off 200 employees at plants all across America. Now, thanks to the new law I signed, making historic investments in clean energy, business is booming again. By the way, they call it the Inflation Reduction Act. Within that is the act related to climate and it’s $368 billion. And when I passed that, not one single guy on the other team voted for it. Nobody voted for it on the other team. Since I signed that bill into law, Arcosa has received $1.1 billion in orders for new wind towers. And today, we’re here breaking ground on a new plant that’s going to create 250 new good paying jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:29)', 'Speech': 'And meanwhile, we’re speeding up permitting for transmission lines so wind energy produced by these towers reaches people’s homes because what’s happening now is it’s hard to get. A lot of these towers are old and everybody is, not in my neighborhood, they don’t want a big new tower going up. So we’re strengthening the towers and we’re going to go underground. It costs six times as much to go underground, but we’re learning how to do that more cheaply so it doesn’t cause the forest fires and all the things that happen when major windstorms knock these lines down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:03)', 'Speech': 'My administration recently completed review of a proposed SunZia line, the transportation energy from a planned wind farm here in New Mexico, in Arizona, and California. So you’re going to generate the energy here, and be able to transmit it all the way across Arizona, and into California as well. These projects are expected to create 2,000 new construction jobs and up to 150 permanent jobs, providing clean energy for up to 3 million Americans, 3 million, and reducing the pressure of the climate change. Like I said, Bidenomics is about bringing supply chains back home. Arcosa makes wind towers that’s going to go into turbines made by GE Verona… Excuse me, I mispronounced it. Vernova in Florida and New York. Pattern energy will use these turbines to build the largest wind farms in the Western Hemisphere spanning Lincoln, Torrance and San Miguel counties in New Mexico. And SunZia will use that energy to power homes all across the Southwest. That’s Bidenomics. It’s cheaper. It’s cheaper.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:26)', 'Speech': 'That’s what we’re talking about, investing in America. This company says investing in making it here is a direct result of the law is signed almost exactly a year ago, the most significant investment in clean energy and combating the existential threat of climate change ever anywhere in the world. Like I said, it’s $368 billion and Governor Lujan Grisham is leading the way in launching the New Mexico Community Solar Program, so families will save money on electric bills, stopping leaks of super polluting methane from oil and gas operations. We’re capping thousands of those wells all across America, beginning in Western Pennsylvania, coming West, and putting New Mexico on a path for cleaner, cheaper electric transmission future as well in this state.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:16)', 'Speech': 'Folks, when I think climate, I think jobs, I don’t think all the dangers, there’s real danger, but the jobs to fix the problem. My mother used to have an expression after I lost my wife and daughter and she was trying to console me. She said, ” Joe, out of anything bad, something good will happen if you look hard enough for it.” Well, all across America, we’re looking. There are going to be a lot of good things that are going to happen as a consequence of this problem we’re facing. What Arcosa is doing here is part of a much broader clean energy manufacturing. It’s going to happen in big cities and rural communities as well. Like in Colorado, where CS Wind broke ground on what will be the world’s largest wind tower manufacturing plant. And coincidentally, CS Wind is Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, you know that very quiet Republican lady? It’s in her district who along with every other Republican, voted against this bill and it’s making all this possible and she railed against its passage, but that’s okay. She’s welcoming it now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:25)', 'Speech': 'When I ran for office, I promised to be president for all Americans, whether you live in a blue state or a red state, I’m going to keep my promise. Before we made this clean energy investment, Siemens Corporation laid off workers who were making wind turbine parts and put the plant in Iowa and Kansas into what they refer to as hibernation. I hibernated in Iowa for a while. But look, now we’re reopening both these plants and rehiring workers. In New York, GE is investing 50 million for a new manufacturing assembly line making critical components for turbines in partnership with organized labor. Every one of these companies has pointed to the clean energy law that we originated and I signed as a reason for making these investments. And we’re making sure rural communities are benefiting from these historic investments as well. It’s not just urban areas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:26)', 'Speech': 'We’re investing over $160 million in New Mexico to support conservation and climate smart agriculture and forestry, like improved water management for grazing livestock and ways to improve soil. Helping farmers and ranchers get paid for doing the right thing, planting material that absorbs carbon from the air and not just… Look, we’ve launched the Rural Partners Network, placing federal employees on the ground in New Mexico to help rural communities take advantage of the federal resources that are there because this is all new stuff. People on the ground say, “Here’s how you do it. This is what you do.” Building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out means strengthening our rural economy so farmers and ranchers and their children don’t have to leave home to find opportunities for work.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:16)', 'Speech': 'Where I come from, it’s all about pride. It’s all about restoring pride, being able to make a living in the community you love and where you’re raised and not have to leave. Folks, it’s all part of my plan. The plan is to invest in America. We’re transforming our country, including by rebuilding America’s infrastructure. We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We were number one in the world. That’s ports, railroads, airports, roads, everything. You know where we are now? We’re number 13 in the world. China used to be number eight, now they’re number two. How can you have the best economy in the world with second rate infrastructure? It’s not'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:34)', 'Speech': 'We’re investing $160 million in Eastern New Mexico rural water system to build a new transmission pipeline providing a critical water supply to nearly 70,000 people from Clovis to Portales to Canon Air Force Base. Look, right now over 114,000 homes and small businesses across New Mexico don’t have access to high-speed internet. We’re investing over $1 billion in this state to connect every corner of this state, especially rural communities and family farms to affordable internet. People sometimes say, “Why are you doing that?” Imagine if a long time Roosevelt and telephones came along saying, “We’re not going to help invest in telephones.” Come on man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:23)', 'Speech': 'I don’t know what the hell we’re thinking. Already we’re saving nearly 170,000 New Mexico families $30 a month on internet bills, so far. We’re making investments like this all across the country. If I could pause for another second, there was a distinguished senator from the state of Alabama who used to be a pretty good football coach and he’s railed against this legislation. And then I noticed he had a big announcement, “Alabama’s going to get a billion, $200 million [inaudible 00:25:59].” And I thought, wait a minute, didn’t he rail against that for a long, long time? I was inclined to go down and help him celebrate, but I decided not to.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:10)', 'Speech': 'Look, we can see exactly where we’re making these investments and you can see exactly where they are. If you go to invest.gov, you’ll know exactly where every one of these investments is going throughout America. These investments create thousands of good paying jobs. We’re making sure workers have the skills to do the jobs. For example, in New Mexico, we’re funding the mobile training unit run by the plumbers and pipefitters union, UA Local 412. It’s going to train plumbers and pipefitters and HVAC workers with a focus on training Latino workers, indigenous people, and people recovering from substance abuse.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:55)', 'Speech': 'And I know you’re probably thinking what a lot of our very conservative Republican friends, ” Biden’s spending all this money, man, my taxes are going to go up.” Unless you make more than $400,000 a year, your federal taxes aren’t going to go up a single penny. And guess what? I did all this without raising anybody’s taxes in the middle class. And one other little thing, during this process, I cut the federal budget in two years by $1.7 trillion. 1.7 the largest anyone’s ever done in two years, the last guy increased the national debt by 40%. Folks, we’ve done all this without raising tax in the middle class, and I promised we’ll never raise federal tax in anyone making less than 400,000 a year. I’ve kept that promise and I’m going to keep it unlike the last president. And as I said, my first two years in office the federal deficit fell by 1.7 trillion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:23)', 'Speech': 'Look, let me close with this, I’m not here to declare victory on the economy. We’ve got a lot more work to do, but we have a plan and it’s turning things around. Bidenomics is just another way of saying restore the American Dream. 40 years of trickle down economic policy, limit the Dream to those at the top. But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:57)', 'Speech': 'In the heartland, small towns, raise their kids on a good paycheck, be able to keep their roots where they grew up. My dad used to have a saying, I mean it sincerely. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your pride, it’s about dignity.” And he meant it, not a joke. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” Being able to say, and you think I’m kidding, but some of some, the folks in Congress knew my dad, he meant it. And he said, “The real question, Joey, is, at the end of the month after you pay all your bills, is there anything left? Do you have a little breathing room? Just a little bit of breathing room?” Well, folks, that’s part of the American dream and that’s Bidenomics.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:51)', 'Speech': 'It’s rooted in what has always worked best in this country, investing in America, invest in Americans because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class with stronger economic growth, that benefits everybody, the poor, the wealthy, everybody. And for the longest time, we’ve been told to give up on American manufacturing that it can’t happen again and we just can’t do it anymore. Well, as you might’ve noticed, I’ve never believed that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:23)', 'Speech': 'As I said, America used to lead the world of manufacturing, we’re going to do it again. I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. Just remember who we are, we’re the United States of America. And there’s nothing beyond, I mean it sincerely, think of any objective we’ve set as a goal that we’ve ever not met. Name one, no matter what it is. We’ve never, never, never, when we’ve worked together, failed. Nothing’s beyond our capacity of we work together. And God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.'}]"

And this will make a significant progress in strengthening our three nations’ capabilities to detect and track North Korea’s missiles.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:24)', 'Speech': 'In countering the DPRK’s nuclear and missile threats, we concurred the trilateral defense exercises were crucial. As such, annual plans will be established for the ROK, U.S., Japan drills we committed to.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:39)', 'Speech': 'In the meantime, as North Korea funds its nuclear and missile programs by exploiting labor and human rights, efforts to monitor and stem such activities will be redoubled. To deter the DPRK’s illicit funding activities, a new trilateral working group on DPRK cyber activities will be established. Moreover, Korea, the U.S., and Japan, in their pursuit of Indo-Pacific strategies, oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:11)', 'Speech': 'Respectful sovereignty, territorial integrity, the peaceful settlement of disputes, among others, undergird a rules-based international order that we resolve to safeguard by intensifying our collaboration.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:23)', 'Speech': 'As part of such endeavors, our three nations agreed to support ASEAN and Pacific Island countries with their maritime security capacity-building efforts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:34)', 'Speech': 'Furthermore, to help Ukrainians regain freedom and pursue reconstruction, we are determined to increase our three-way coordination.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:47)', 'Speech': 'Next, we, the three leaders, discussed how to work together to promote shared prosperity and future growth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:56)', 'Speech': 'First of all, in the field of economic security'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:46)', 'Speech': 'Korea, the US, and Japan committed to have their national laboratories expand joint R&D and personnel exchanges providing a cornerstone for the three countries leadership in science and technology innovation. Moreover, for the sake of shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, in line with the needs of Asian and Pacific Island countries, effective support measures will be sought and implemented collectively. Today, we, the three leaders, affirmed our commitment to the trilateral partnership towards a new era and possibilities thereof, grounded in the core values of freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, a strong alliance of values among Korea, the US, and Japan will help build a world that’s more peaceful and prosperous by serving as a sturdy foundation. Mr. President, I thank you once again for your hospitality. Next time I hope that we’ll be reunited in the Republic of Korea. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:03)', 'Speech': 'First of all, in Maui, Hawaii, wildfires caused devastating damage. I expressed my sympathy and I really pray for the peace of those who have lost their lives. In order to offer support, a total of $2 million worth of support by our country has been decided, and therefore, the relief for the affected people and for the earliest recovery of the affected areas, Japan will proactively do our contribution.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:43)', 'Speech': 'Today, I have visited Camp David and the three of us have spent a truly meaningful time. I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Joe for the kind invitation. Together with Joe and President Yun, this has been a precious opportunity for myself to further deepen the relationship of trust and confidence. For the first time ever, instead of in the sidelines of multilateral conferences, we have held the Trilateral Summit on a standalone basis. Here at Camp David, numerous historical meetings have taken place and it is a huge honor to have printed a fresh page in its history with this meeting. The foundation of the trilateral collaboration are the solid firm bilateral relationships. The three of us have understood this more than anyone else and have executed our understanding in practice.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:59)', 'Speech': 'In January this year, I visited the United States and later President Yun visited Japan in March and then to the US in April. And in May, I myself traveled to South Korea and we have bolstered a mutual relationship. At the moment, the free and open international order based on the rule of law is in crisis due to Russia’s aggression of the Ukraine. The international order is shaken from its foundation. The unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas are continuing and the nuclear and missile threats of North Korea is only becoming ever larger.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:55)', 'Speech': 'Under such circumstances to make our trilateral strategic collaboration a blossom and bloom is only logical and almost inevitable and is required in this era. The three of us here today declare our determination to pioneer with a new era of Japan US ROK partnership. How we will advance the corporation of our three countries going forward, I will discuss from three perspectives. Firstly, other coordination between the Japan, US, and the US ROK alliances will be reinforced and Trilateral Security Corporation will be brought to a new height. At this meeting, we agreed to hold the Japan US ROK multi-domain joint exercises on an annual basis. Furthermore, regarding the real time-sharing of North Korea’s missile warning information that we agreed last November, the initial steps have been implemented and an important first step has been advanced towards the launch of the mechanism by the end of the year. We also agreed on the establishment of the working group on North Korea cyber activities considered to be the source of finance for nuclear and missile development and on other matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:40)', 'Speech': 'At the same time, we shared our recognition that the way is open for dialogue with North Korea. I then stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints and once again received the strong support of Joe and President Yun for the immediate resolution of this matter. We also agreed to work together through the Indo-Pacific Dialogue and the Development Cooperation to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific, and in particular to coordinate capacity building support in the domain of maritime security, particularly with regard to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries. Furthermore, we agreed to promote cooperation in the field of economic security, including critical and emerging technologies and supply chain resilience. Third, developing a framework for trilateral cooperation. This will create a foundation for continuous and stable enhancement of coordination among the three countries.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:15)', 'Speech': 'After confirming that the three countries will promote multi-layered cooperation at all levels, it was agreed that the Trilateral Summit meeting will be held at least once a year. And likewise, the ministers of Foreign Affairs, Defense, and National Security Advisors will each also meet at least once a year. And the financial minister as well as the industry and commerce ministers will be meeting. We will consider the Camp David Principles issued today at a historic turning point for the international community to be a new compass for trilateral cooperation. And we will vigorously implement the concrete cooperation outlined in the Camp David statement of Japan, ROK, and US on our partnership. Together with Joe and President Yun, we will continue to work to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the three countries in order to safeguard a free and open international order based on the rule of law. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:24)', 'Speech': 'President Yun, how much confidence can Japan and the US have about Seoul’s long-term commitment to reproachment when polls show the solid majority of Korea disapproves of your handling and mending of the forced labor issue?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:39)', 'Speech': 'And Prime Minister Kishida, what assurances can you give to your country’s citizens who fear bolstering your security cooperation in this matter could lead to the country and to a economic cold war with China? And if you’ll indulge me, Mr. President, on a domestic matter, what is your reaction to the special council appointment last weekend to your son? Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:36)', 'Speech': 'That is my administration’s consistent policy. Based on this perception towards regional stability, our efforts will continue.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:49)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:56)', 'Speech': 'And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars, and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:25)', 'Speech': 'Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, we had the historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That’s the international community’s evaluation. However, there are still concerns that Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:05)', 'Speech': 'Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the DPRK. And across the world, how we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world. So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That’s where we find our shared interests lie.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:53)', 'Speech': 'And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science. Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:29)', 'Speech': 'Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits, tangible benefits to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology. But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that’s exactly where our interests are aligned.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:29)', 'Speech': 'We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we’re not going to forget about them or their loved ones. And there’s clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: that we share a common position. We’re committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war, and those have been abducted and detained.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:55)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times, and I wasn’t directly asked, but implied, is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgements about: Would they be better off if they make commitments? Will they move?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:16)', 'Speech': 'Think about, as students of history, all of you, and you are, think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don’t anticipate it. And so, I just think this is, we’re not going to forget, we’re not giving up, and we’re going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:28)', 'Speech': 'This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the ROK. At international fora, we have repeated meetings, we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we’ve had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It’s already in motion, dynamically.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:58)', 'Speech': 'Economic security dialogue was started, or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also financial ministers and defense ministers have had meetings. And so, we’ve had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We’re seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:44)', 'Speech': 'Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan’s feelings toward our bilateral relations. And we’d like to continue such efforts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:12)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:18)', 'Speech': 'Thank you very much. Then, let me see from Kyodo, Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:54)', 'Speech': 'Prime Minister Kishida has mentioned that as China’s threat in Asia is rising, Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow. What do you think about this comment, President Biden?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:07)', 'Speech': 'And the situation in Asia, where China’s threat is rising, what is the meaning and significance of the trilateral relationship with Japan, US, ROK becoming stronger in multiple layers?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:19)', 'Speech': 'President Yoon Suk Yeol, I have a question to Your Excellency. North Korea’s nuclear missile development is a major security threat to Japan, South Korea, and the US. As North Korea’s provocations continue to escalate, what is the meaning and significance of the three countries declaring a new era of partnership?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:40)', 'Speech': 'Regarding the release of treated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, did Prime Minister Kishida explain the matter at the trilateral or the bilateral summit today?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:52)', 'Speech': 'To the recent Japan-ROK summit meeting, Your Excellency, you expressed your intent to respect the IAEA report despite'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:07)', 'Speech': 'And to Prime Minister Kishida, this is the first time that a trilateral summit is held on a standalone basis rather than on the sidelines of international meetings. You have said that the trilateral cooperation will be raised to new heights for the security environment in East Asia. And without the resolution of abduction, North Korea is continuing nuclear missile development. What is the meaning for North Korea?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:35)', 'Speech': 'And in eastern South China Seas, by maritime advancement, China is continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo. What is the meaning for China?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:02)', 'Speech': 'Look, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You’ve showed strong leadership through the G7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:28)', 'Speech': 'And they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:38)', 'Speech': 'If my memory serves me well, and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister, we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn’t have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country, or 150,000 forces and invade that country, invade that country without any rationale other than, if you read Putin’s speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland. I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was … Just imagine if we’d done nothing. Imagine if we’d done nothing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (44:33)', 'Speech': 'And the point was immediately recognized, if I’m not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we’re in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren’t powerful on borders?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (44:52)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the … Let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It’s not possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:10)', 'Speech': 'And they’ve joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan’s leadership, from day one, it has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe, well beyond Europe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:28)', 'Speech': 'I say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:43)', 'Speech': 'And with Japan’s leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this war extend well beyond Europe, well beyond Europe. It’s a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister’s comments at Shangri-La capture that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:58)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there’s a lot happening.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (46:10)', 'Speech': 'And the idea that we’re going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, “Well, that’s only a European problem.” There hasn’t been that kind of invasion since World War II.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (46:19)', 'Speech': 'And so, as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with President Zelenskyy’s team and further peace formula, noting that nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. But nonetheless, we’re meeting with them constantly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (46:40)', 'Speech': 'And your other two questions about China, I’ll just say this. This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come, China obviously came up. Not to say we don’t share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (47:08)', 'Speech': 'It was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It’s not just here. It has a phenomenal impact. Think about what’s … At any rate, I won’t get going. I’ll take too long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (47:27)', 'Speech': 'As you’ve seen from the initiatives we’re announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together and I think you’re going to see it expand. It’s not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting. But we’re about to, we’ve laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world. Someone once said in a different context that, about a healthcare provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. This is a big deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:15)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:31)', 'Speech': 'First, as to North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations and the threats that are posed and how we plan to counter those threats together among our three countries, let me address that question.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:48)', 'Speech': 'Of the cooperative frameworks among our three countries, what is most symbolic out of those is our cooperation in defense area. Any provocations or attacks against any one of our three countries will trigger a decision-making process of this trilateral framework, and our solidarity will become even stronger and harder.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (49:21)', 'Speech': 'And at the same time, missile information will be shared in a real-time basis, and systematic training and drills will be implemented in accordance with systematic annual schedules, regular schedules, and regular trainings that we plan to carry out together against the DPRK’s missile provocations. That will be our response.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (49:47)', 'Speech': 'And at the same time, regarding your question concerning the water release from the Fukushima plant, as a matter of fact, that issue was not addressed during our summit because it was not on the agenda. But still, let me try to address that question. The Fukushima plant’s treated water, if it’s going to have some type of impact, it would flow through the entire Pacific Ocean having an impact not just on our three countries, but all countries around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:19)', 'Speech': 'As such, for the sake of safety and health of the people of our three countries and all members of the international community, that should be something that we need to place the highest priority on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:32)', 'Speech': 'Regarding this treated water, based on scientific principles, all of the processing should be carried out accordingly. And at the same time, internationally recognized and reliable IAEA’s investigation results are something that we can trust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:52)', 'Speech': 'And I would like to make sure that everything is conducted and carried out in accordance with the procedures established by the IAEA. Together with the international community and also together with the Koreans, transparent data disclosure would be necessary, in my opinion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:40)', 'Speech': 'Under this backdrop, on this occasion, we agreed to enhance the coordination between the US-Japan and the US-ROK alliances and to bring the trilateral security cooperation to new heights.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:59)', 'Speech': 'This is indeed the requirement of this era. And by this summit, I am sure that the trilateral security cooperation will further advance and reinforce the regional peace and stability.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:43)', 'Speech': 'I also stated that the abduction issue is a humanitarian issue with time constraints. And Joe and President Yoon reiterated their strong support for the immediate resolution of this matter.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:08)', 'Speech': 'We also shared our recognition that the path to dialogue with North Korea is open.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:17)', 'Speech': 'Furthermore, once again, the presidents of both countries aligned with me in strongly opposing unilateral changes to the status quo through the use of force. We will continue our efforts to further strengthen the strategic partnership among the three countries in order to defend the free, open, and international order based on the rule of law.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:52)', 'Speech': 'That is all.

We’re going to rebuild the way the people of Maui want to build. But it’s going to be hard. It America’s deadliest wildfire in over a century. And Jill and I walked the front street, what’s left of it. We’ve surveyed the damage from the air as well. The devastation is overwhelming. To date, 114 dead, hundreds of people unaccounted for. I remember when I got the call, my first wife and daughter, I was a young Senator and I got a call in Washington. I hadn’t been sworn in yet. I wasn’t old enough. And I was hiring staff in the capitol at Teddy Kennedy’s office and I got a phone call saying, from my fire department and the young first responder panicking, “You got to come home. There’s been an accident.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:55)', 'Speech': 'Said, “What happened?” He said, “Your wife, she’s dead. Come home.” The tractor trailer had broadsided her and killed her in a car accident along with my little daughter. And I remember all the way down from Washington home wondering what a lot of people here are wondering, “What about my two boys? How are they? They were in the car.” I never got a read on that. Were they going to be all right? They were badly injured. Were they going to make it? Had they made it? It wasn’t until I walked into the emergency room that I saw that they were there. The difference between knowing somebody’s gone and worrying whether they’re available to come back are two different things. And I remember one of the people who helped me the most was Danny Noway. He helped bring me back. So I know the feeling that, as many of the people in this town, this community, that hollow feeling you have in your chest like you’re being sucked into a black hole, wondering, “Will I ever get by this?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:00)', 'Speech': 'And it’s one thing to know, but it’s quite another thing to have to wait to wonder whether your family member is going to be okay. Imagine being a parent wondering whether their child is, where it is. I remember as I said. Press reports of grandfathers crying for lost neighbors while trying to be strong for the ones who survived. Of a woman distributing clothing to survivors who says she didn’t lose her home, but she lost her hometown. But I also want all of you to know the country’s grieves with you stands with you and will do everything possible to help you recover, rebuild and respect culture and traditions when the rebuilding takes place. My administration has been in constant contact with the governor and congressional delegation and local leaders. As soon as I got the governor’s request, I signed the master, the major disaster declaration that mobilized the whole of government response, which means whatever you need, you’re going to get.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:00)', 'Speech': 'For example, the Coast Guard Navy immediately supported maritime search and rescue operations while the army helped fire suppression. Here’s what we’ve been doing since. First, we focused on search and rescue, which is still going on. Right now there are over 450 search and rescue experts working round the clock. Second, I’ve identified FEMA’s Administrator Griswell to lean forward as she always has done to help survivors get immediate aid. FEMA is quickly provided five 55,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 beds, 10,000 blankets, working to help remove the debris, repair roads, and restore power. Additionally, my Department of Housing Urban Development is working with the state to make sure survivors can move from emergency shelters into temporary housing to finally have a permanent place to call home as well. Small business administration is making low interest federal disaster loans available to Hawaiian businesses. Many of them we’ve seen here burned to the ground.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:04)', 'Speech': 'Homeowners and renters and nonprofits if you need help, you can visit FEMA’s Disaster Recovery Center at Maui College or go to disasterassistance.gov. Today I’m appointing Bob Fenton whose here. Where are you, Bob?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:15)', 'Speech': 'We’re also going to bring capabilities to help you rebuild so your critical infrastructure is more resilient in the future. That all this matters. Let me close with this. From stories of grief, we’ve seen so many stories of hope and heroism, of the aloha spirit. Every emergency responder put their lives in line for us to save others, our everyday heroes, neighbors helping neighbors, native Hawaiian leaders offering solace and strength. And this banyan tree, one called it The Diamond In The Rough Of Hope. Another referred to, Fire Cannot Reach Its Roots. What he said, Fire Cannot Reach Its Roots. That’s Maui, that’s America. And to the people of Hawaii, we’re with you for as long as it takes, I promise you. May God bless all those we’ve lost. May God find those who we haven’t determined yet. And may God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Now I’m going to happy to turn this over to the governor. Governor Green.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:02)', 'Speech': 'Friends, we’ve been through so much together in recent years. We had three years of the COVID pandemic which left us isolated. We’ve had volcanic eruptions in 2018 and ’22 which ravaged Big Island. And there are scars here in our people’s lives from opioids and homelessness. But none of this has been as tragic as the fire in Lahaina which over these past 13 days has come down on us like a mountain. The amount of loss we’ve experienced in such a short time will be difficult for us to even fathom, but we’ll hold each other up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:41)', 'Speech': 'Our hearts are broken and we’ll heal. But with the assistance of President Biden, The Federal Government and the love and compassion of resources throughout our state, we know we have the support to lift us up as we find those who are lost. We’ll deal with the tragedy. The President within six hours, six hours met our needs with The Federal Movement. Six hours. I don’t think that’s ever happened before. So it’s our deepest appreciation to you and Dr. Biden. Thank you. The people of Lahaina will need time, we know, to heal, to recover, to grieve. And thank you Mr. President for understanding that and for sharing, as we have shared, that Lahaina belongs to its people and we’re committed to rebuilding the way the people of Lahaina want.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:38)', 'Speech': 'We want to emphasize that, again, this land is for the people of Maui and it’s reserved as they return and rebuild. So we’ve instructed with the wisdom of the President and the wisdom of other first responders and FEMA to reach out to our Attorney General and enhance criminal penalties for those who take advantage of our victims. She’ll share more about that in coming days. Right now, I want to speak to the world, and when I say this, of course, no one can travel to West Maui right now. We will share when that is possible again. Only returning residents and authorized emergency relief workers should come here now, but all of the other areas of Maui, friends, and the rest of Hawaii are safe. They’re open, they’re available.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:28)', 'Speech': 'The mystique and love here, the Aloha is here for you. And the reason I say that is because when you come, you’ll support our local economy and help speed the recovery of the people that are suffering right now, the thousands and thousands of family members that may have had loss, who will still have to care for the others that remain. Briefly to support those who have been affected by the fire, the American Red Cross has stepped up. Please support them. They’re supporting our people. The Hawaii Community Foundation, again, another place you can lean in. We will assure that those resources go to the people that are suffering bring.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:08)', 'Speech': 'Finally, there may never be another time in our state’s history ever when we need to summon the spirit of aloha as deeply as we summon it today. So for the good of everyone who has been impacted, share aloha, thank you for making that a part of what we are. The world is watching and we’ll show them the true strength of our culture, our people, and all that we believe. And as they watch us heal, protect and nurture one another, the world will be reminded why it loves and embraces Hawaii, and we embrace it. Aloha.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:46)', 'Speech': 'Got too emotional. Next, I’m honored to introduce Brian Schatz, a dear friend and our senator.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:24)', 'Speech': 'Lahaina is one of the most special places on the planet. It was the seat of power for the Hawaiian Kingdom. It was a whaling town, it was a plantation town, and most recently a vibrant, multicultural coastal community. And it was gone in an instant. These fires have completely devastated families and communities, and the loss is unimaginable. We mourn parents, grandparents, and kids, aunties and uncles, friends and neighbors. To the first responders who put their own lives at risk to save others and to everyone on Maui who has been working around the clock to help this community while your own lives have been turned upside down mahalo.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:14)', 'Speech': 'Please know that we are going to do everything we can to get you the help that you need. This is the deadliest natural disaster that Hawaii has ever seen. And as a result, this is the biggest federal response that Hawaii has ever seen. But we will need more support from everyone. The Maui community will pull together and chart its own future. But the scope of this tragedy means that we will need everyone in Hawaii and across the country. The work will continue and we will be there every step of the way. I’d now like to introduce my partner and the United States Senate, Mazie Hirono.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:10)', 'Speech': 'And of course, the federal family of agencies starting with FEMA. Bob, you have been through many of these disasters. You are person who will help us recover. So all of our family of federal agencies, FEMA, the DO, Department of Defense, Interior, HUD, Army Corps of Engineers, SBA, they were all here from the very beginning to provide the help that we need. And my hope is that Lahaina and Upcountry will rebuild in a way that we will listen to the people here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:44)', 'Speech': 'And that hope is represented by this banyan tree that stands here. While all around things burn, the Banyan tree stands and it is a symbol of hope. And when I talk with the arborist who is here to make sure that this tree survives, he said that the tree will tell us what it needs, and our job is to listen. And that is our job, to listen to the people of Maui, to listen to the people of Lahaina as we rebuild. Mahalo [foreign language 00:18:10] to all of you who are here and most especially to the President, First Lady. We will rebuild and we will rebuild listening to the voices and the values of the people here. Now I turn to Jill Tokuda, our newest member.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:32)', 'Speech': 'The pain we feel as we recall happier times under her branches, our undying hope that under the charred and scarred exterior, there is still life and renewal. And while this tree is a symbol, her roots, our people have been scattered far and wide. And while we go here and we look and we search, we know that so many of her roots, her people still wait here to be found. Others, not often seen, are in places like the beaches of Hanukkah, the homesteads of [foreign language 00:20:07] gathered in shelters and our communities clinging together. I have spent time among her roots, our people spread out across Maui and like the urgent care and attention being given to our beloved Banyan tree, her roots, our people need that same urgent care and attention. They need everything from basic identification and documents, tents and water trailers, mental health care.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:35)', 'Speech': 'We can heal the body, but this, this takes so much longer to recover from something like this. Basic wifi connections, air quality monitoring and testing, especially for many who still live in and around these areas. The needs are great, but so are the struggles of courage. I’ve sat and hugged a wife still looking for her husband till this day. I’ve heard of a child who does not want to leave the ocean because he thinks the fires will burn him. And I’ve seen the fear on the face of a survivor in their eyes because the wind blew too hard and it took her back to that moment. We know some of our most difficult days still lie before us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:19)', 'Speech': 'It’s going to be long. It’s going to leave us feeling heavy with loss, frustrated, angry that we can’t move faster. But if our roots, our people are to not just survive but thrive. If there is to actually be renewal and life beneath these scars, these burns, then we must all draw, as has been said, on the wisdom of our Kupuna and the lessons that have taught us to live and lead with aloha and lokahi. We must remember that our strength is on our connections to one another, our ability to communicate and care with each other. The challenge we face before us will no doubt test our aloha. But if there’s one thing I know absolutely 110% for sure, aloha always wins. Mahalo. I now bring up Mayor Bissen for some words.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:59)', 'Speech': 'As a young prosecutor in 1987, I started my career in that courtroom. There’s much memories for all of us and that’s why we hurt because we don’t have those anymore. But what we do have is help, all the help that’s been mentioned by every person standing here, and more importantly, the heroes there facing horror and going after that. And that’s the reason we can move forward. It’s because we have the help, the community has come together. And when I say community, I mean the world’s community. Not just Maui, not just Hawaii, not just the United States of America, but all countries have come forward to help us. We’ve brought that together. So what that leaves us with is hope.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:48)', 'Speech': 'We have hope that we can put this together as we comfort those who have hurt so much and we try to heal. And so again, I’m here on behalf of the people of the county of Maui, Moloka’i, Lanai, to thank every one of you who have given to us, who have donated, who have offered their services, and especially the leaders behind me, who in each of their own ways have also helped us. And I want to just say how responsive the President has been. He called yesterday, asked for the help we needed, we talked a little bit about that, and within two hours, one of his cabinet members called me back to answer my question. So we’ve been getting all the help that we need. Again, because we want to let our people know that there is hope.

That’s going to save the typical borrower around a $1,000 a year. It’s going to give borrowers a little bit more breathing room, and if your annual income is less than $30,000, your monthly payment will be zero until it gets above $30,000. As long as you pay what you owe under this plan, you’ll no longer see your loan balance grow because of unpaid interest. Under the SAVE Plan, monthly payments are based on your income, not your student loan balance. And here’s how you can enroll in the SAVE program. Visit studentaid.gov/save and submit an application. It takes about 10 minutes to fill it out, and if you’re eligible for the SAVE Plan, sign up now so you can lower your monthly payments in advance of payments resuming this fall.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:41)', 'Speech': 'I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, as long as I’m president, my administration will never stop fighting to deliver relief to borrowers and bring the promise of college to more Americans.

In 1963, 60 years ago, President John F. Kennedy issued a call for lawyers to convene at the White House. He implored them to use their skills as private attorneys general to bring the fight for civil rights from the streets and into the courtrooms in America. It was from that meeting that the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights was formed. For the past 60 years and counting, the Lawyers Committee network comprised of our nation’s most dedicated and talented attorneys both on our staff and throughout the private bar, have fought for civil rights, filed landmark cases, and won. Marshaling over 1 million pro bono hours from firms across the nation in the last decade alone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:29)', 'Speech': 'We have been a force multiplier for justice and a powerful example of legal advocacy and a fight for civil rights. We’re honored to be able to call the Biden Administration a partner in justice. We have worked together to advance the cause of student debt relief, racial equity, police accountability, health equity, fair housing, and defending diversity and inclusion and more. The theme for this weekend’s March on Washington was not a commemoration but a continuation. I think that same theme applies to our work and our work together, Mr. President. I’m reminded that the times we’re in tell us that the work is more urgent than ever. Together we must continue to fight. We feel the same urgency that I know you feel, Mr. President.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:16)', 'Speech': 'That was felt by those lawyers and President Kennedy 60 years ago. It’s on all of us to continue the great march forward. We’re fortunate to have a president who understands that to his core, a president who is helping to lead the way. And now it is my honor to introduce to you the President of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:26)', 'Speech': 'We are all too often reminded of what you do matters so very much and you are reminded of that on a regular basis. On Saturday morning, the nation observed the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington. By the evening, a white gunman in Jacksonville, Florida reportedly driven by racial animus, went on a shootings rampage at a store near Edward Waters University, a historical Black university. Three Black Americans were murdered in cold blood. Racist violence today hearkens back to the church bombings and the cross burnings. In that same town five years earlier, there were another five young Blacks who were killed. While we gathered the facts and law enforcement has opened a federal civil rights investigation to treat this this terror as a possible hate crime, the act of domestic violence extremism.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:24)', 'Speech': 'It clearly is, but we know this as it made clear in my inaugural address. White supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison. It’s been allowed to grow faster and fester in our communities. To the point where the US intelligence community determined that domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy is the greatest terrorist threat we face in the homeland. The greatest threat. We have to act. We have to act. After the racist mass shootings in Buffalo last year, I got an opportunity to meet with every one of the family members. The Lawyers Committee and other leaders helped us host the United We Stand Summit here in the East Room in the White House.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:11)', 'Speech': 'We made clear that America is the most multiracial, most dynamic nation in the history of the world. All of us need to say clearly and as forcefully as we can that hate will not prevail in America. Hate will not prevail in America. Pause for just a moment. I thought things had changed. I was able to literally not figuratively talk to Strom Thurmond into voting for the Civil Rights Act before he died. And I thought, well, maybe there’s real progress, but hate never dies. It just hides. It hides under the rocks and when someone breathes little oxygen in it, it comes out with roaring out. And silence is complicity and we’re not going to remain silent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:56)', 'Speech': 'You’re not, nor am I, nor are the vast majority of Americans. Denialism is worse and we’ll call it for what it is. While we know tragedy can’t be forever overcome or fully understood, there are certain things that we do know. With your help, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, but we must not stop until we ban assault weapons and high capacity magazine. We will do that once and we’ll do it again. We can’t fully prevent people from being radicalized to hate and violence, but we must address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize violent extremists and that’s going to be hard. It conflicts in many cases with the First Amendment. We’ve got a lot to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:52)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I issued the country’s first ever national strategy on countering domestic terrorism and I signed a landmark hate crime legislation that we’ve passed. And we have to continue to act though. Now is the time for all Americans to speak up when history is being erased, books are being banned. Do you ever think we’d have this conversation here at this time? Diversity is being attacked. As I said earlier, we’re one of the most diverse countries in the history of the world. Diversity is a strength of our nation, a cornerstone of our democracy. Now’s the time for all of us, especially all of you who make this your life’s work to protect that essential truth and that’s why we’re here today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:36)', 'Speech': 'In June 1963, a defining time for America. On one single day, Vivian Malone and James Hood, two Black students arrived at the doors of the University of Alabama. Opened by the hope of Brown versus the Board of Education, but blocked by the organized hate of George Wallace. President Kennedy spoke to the nation from the Oval Office, warning of a moral crisis of bigotry facing the nation and announced a landmark civil rights bill. Late that night, NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated outside his home of Mississippi. Bernard Siegel, the Jewish lawyer in New York, published a statement signed by dozens of other lawyers, white and Black in the Alabama newspaper issuing a call to actions from attorneys around the country to fight this injustice.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:30)', 'Speech': 'By the end of June, more than 200 of you, 200 lawyers of different races from all across America were invited to the White House to strategize in this very room. That day in June 1963 in the east room of the White House, they established the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. His mission “to mobilize the nation’s leading lawyers as agents of change in the civil rights movement.” And that’s who you are and that’s what happened. Over time, the committee evolved from volunteers representing individual cases to full-time lawyers, leading broader high impact litigation, voting rights, employment, education, housing, and so much more. Today you understand civil rights as the unfinished fight of America and you’re leading the fight after having led the fight for the past 60 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:23)', 'Speech': 'You’ve been critical partners to this administration for helping us bring and protect the right to vote to chart new pathways to further equal opportunity in higher education, protecting the value of diversity and full inclusion of all Americans in the promise of America. That’s what it’s all about. To those who came before to all of you here today, to future lawyers who will heed the call to serve, I say thank you, thank you, thank you. Because the God’s truth is it wouldn’t have happen without you, as far as we’ve gotten. We need you badly. As the Lawyers Committee was being established, another kind of planning was going on in June of 1963. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, Dorothy Height and other leaders of the movement were planning a long discussed march that would finally come to Washington.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:15)', 'Speech': 'The day after convening the Lawyers Committee, President Kennedy hosted the march organizers in the cabinet room expressing concern that any violence could derail the passage of the civil rights bill, but the march organizers were undeterred. They would not be slowed. Their crusade was about the law and the nation bearing witness of the power of the righteous cause. So on this day in August 1963, hundreds of thousands of Americans of every background descended on Washington DC from all of America. They made their way to the Lincoln Memorial where they heard from ministers, priests and rabbis.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:55)', 'Speech': 'They heard from heroes like Daisy Bates, the only woman to speak at the march who spoke about the power of women in the movement and she was way ahead of our time. By the way, there’s more women in my administration than men. That’s not an accident. And they heard from other patriots before hearing Dr. King preach about the dream that declared a new American anthem for jobs and freedom, political rights and economic justice. To redeem what he described as “the promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.” A promise derived from the very ideal America. That we’re all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our entire lives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:42)', 'Speech': 'While we never fully lived up to that promise, we’ve never thank God fully walked away from it because of the power, because people never stopped marching. We secured the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and so much more. Yet for all the progress, there is a backlash and heroes murdered, bombings of Black churches, including the 16th Baptist Church in Birmingham, where four little girls were murdered. A reminder that throughout our history, when the great nations have taken great steps forward, they often are met by the oldest, darkest and most vicious forces in the country rising up and dragging us down again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:22)', 'Speech': 'That’s why earlier today I met with a group of our nation’s civil rights leaders, including President Hewitt. And that’s why we gather here in remembrance and in solidarity as we cannot keep marching forward unless we are determined to do so, and it starts with the administration that looks like America. That includes our Vice President Kamala Harris, who is co-chair of the San Francisco Lawyers Committee. And for our administration and with your help, it means pushing back against voter suppression, election subversion, and hate fuel violence. It means when police reform is blocked in Congress, we work together with a civil rights leader family and law enforcement enabling me to sign the most sweeping executive order on police reform ever as we keep pushing for Congress to act and we cannot give up until they pass the John Lewis legislation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:22)', 'Speech': 'He made a commitment that I was going to nominate the first Black woman to be in the Supreme Court and with your help, we got it done. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. My daughter would say, “Everybody’s going to be surprised, she’s smarter than those guys.” She’s brilliant. In addition, we appointed more Black women in the federal courts, circuit courts, matter of fact, than every other president combined in American history. Many of you join me to bill signing from making it clear that interracial marriage and same-sex marriages are protected, period. Making Juneteenth a federal holiday to mark when the last enslaved people of America were finally freed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:22)', 'Speech': 'Progress means a fundamental break with the trickle-down economics that promised prosperity for all but failed Americans, especially Black Americans for so many decades. Kamala and I came to office determined to change our economics, determined to change it in the ways that it has been over the last several decades. The direction of this country is to grow in our view from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. That way everybody does well, the wealthy do very, very well, and everybody has a shot. We’re investing in all of American, the entire nation’s future. And I would argue our plan is working, but to those in America who are so consumed with the worst of our past with grievances and lies and hate and violence, that they’re in opposition to almost everything.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:13)', 'Speech': 'So we must be unyielding recognizing that the great cause of America, which is giving everyone an equal chance, just everyone an equal chance. My dad used to say, “Joey, your job is a lot more than the paycheck.” It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. He actually said this, it’s not a joke. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay,” and mean it. It’s a work of all of us to make sure we keep moving in that direction. We’re reminded of that truth on this day that marks another defining moment in our country’s history. 68 years ago today, Emmett Till was lynched and brutalized. He took his last breath at just 14 years of age for talking to a white woman.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:06)', 'Speech': 'In him, we remember too many other Black Americans, lynched, drowned, burned, castrated for trying to vote, for trying to go to school, for trying to own a business, for trying to preach the gospel, for just trying to live for God’s sake. We also remember the courage of people like Emmett Till’s mother. I find this profound all the years I’ve known of it, but profound. Emmett Till’s mother insisted the casket of her son’s mutilated body remained open so the world could see what was done to him. Imagine as a parent, imagine any circumstance, you having the courage to do that. Let the world see and if you’ve lost children, you understand what I’m talking about. It’s profound.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:57)', 'Speech': 'And she said, “Let the world see what I’ve seen.” That’s what she said. And American saw because she found purpose through her pain. I was able to sign the law, believe it or not, for the first time in American history. Think of this, for the first time, making lynching a federal hate crime in Emmett Till’s name. Took that long. A hundred years. 100 years. Well, last month surrounded by the Till family and friends once again, I signed a law establishing the Mamie and Emmett Till National Monuments in Illinois and in Mississippi, and I’m very proud to have done that. The story, how from trauma hope can grow and the promise of America prevail. That’s what it’s about. Let me close with this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:50)', 'Speech': 'Among the lawyers who convened in this room 60 years ago was the son of a carpenter, a domestic worker in Alabama. His name was Fred Gray. When Dr. King, Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin and other giants in our history needed a lawyer in their fight for freedom, they called Fred. Fred was one of the most important civil rights lawyers in our history whose legal brilliance and strategy desegregated schools and secured the right to vote for millions of people up to that point who had been denied the right to vote. An ordinary minister, he pursued a righteous calling that brought him back here. I was going to say threw him back here, but it brought him back here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:37)', 'Speech': 'It kind of threw him as well, back here to Washington in the same room 59 years later, and I had a great honor. I’ve read about him as a public defender and involved in civil rights myself as a kid’s lawyer, I always wondered what I got to bestow on Fred. 59 years later, the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honor. Remarkable man, I’ll also mention the youngest speaker at the March on Washington and future Congressman John Lewis, who became a friend. As Fred wrote after John’s death that they spoke and prayed that we “keep pushing, keep going, set the record straight.” That’s a defining moment of our time. This is our charge. Keep pushing, keep going, set the record straight.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:46)', 'Speech': 'I know we can. Just remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America, the United States of America. There’s not a single goal we’ve ever set that we’ve failed to accomplish when we did it together. Not a single solitary goal. It takes time, a lot of pain and a hell of a lot of work. But also think of all the people, all the individuals, all the children you’ve all given hope to. It’s not hyperbole. I’m being deadly earnest. Think about what you’ve done and what you continue to do. Let me conclude by saying this, that I think that we’re in an inflection point in history, not just in the United States, but in the world. Every [inaudible 00:22:34] from five to seven, eight generations, things change.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:37)', 'Speech': 'In fundamental ways, I had a physics professor used to say in inflection points, when you’re going down the highway at 60 miles an hour and all of a sudden you take a right turn, 7, 8, 10 degrees to the right. You can never get back in the path you’re on and you have a whole new outline, a whole new destination. You’re not sure where it is. You’ve got to adjust to it. Well, the way I look at it, and I know I’m referred to as a cockeyed optimist, but the way I look at it, you get pronounced overwhelming opportunities in foreign policy, domestic policy and civil rights, but you’re still the engineers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:16)', 'Speech': 'You’re still the people that we are going to need to get it done. We have good people in the government now, but we’re going to make sure that we keep you together because there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we have you on our side. Every time I walk out of my grandfather Finnegan’s home up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he yelled, “Joey, keep the faith.” And my grandmother, “No Joey, spread it. Go spread the faith.”'}]"

But the bottom line is that a lot is happening around the things you wouldn’t think would be happening today on the anniversary of the 60 years of the March. I’ve spoken with the governor and the mayor and Black community leaders in Jacksonville, Florida. The sheriff, who’s an African American. I spent a significant amount of time speaking to everyone, including the governor of Florida. And as I’ve said to the country, we can’t let hate prevail. And it’s on the rise. It’s not diminishing. Silence, I believe, as we’ve all said many times, silence is complicity. We’re not going to remain silent. And so, we have to act against this hate-fueled violence and all that’s happening.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:17)', 'Speech': 'By the way, almost five years to the day that five young Blacks were killed in Jacksonville, I think it was earlier, at a gun, not a gun shop, a store there doing kids toys. But we have to speak out that there’s a whole group of extreme people trying to erase history, trying to walk away from… I mean, the idea that we’re sitting here, I never thought that I’d be president, let alone be president and having the discussion on why books are being banned in American schools. As an administration, we’re going to continue the march forward, jobs and freedom that we have worked so hard for, this group has worked harder than anybody for. And we’re going to get it done. So, I want to thank the group for their leadership and their partnership. And I want to turn this over to the Vice President for a few minutes, and then we’ll get moving.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:08)', 'Speech': 'Our diversity is our strength, and our unity is our power as a nation. And I do believe that we must be guided by knowing that we have so much more in common than what separates us. We must be committed to building communities, building coalitions, understanding that is how we strengthen ourselves as a nation. And the members of the King family are here. Ambassador Andy Young is here. I’m going to, if I may, for the children of Coretta Scott King, paraphrase something she said, which is that the fight for civil rights, for justice, for equality must be fought and won with each generation. We have Yolanda King here, who epitomizes that understanding that it is incumbent on each of us at this moment in time in our country to stand for the sake of unity and foundational principles that out of many, we are one.

Please have a seat. Good afternoon. It’s a room full of leaders. Well, thank you everyone for being here and for all the work that you have done leading up to today. I want to thank, of course, our nation’s champion, President Biden, for your leadership and commitment to lowering cost for working families in every way. And thank you to all of the members of Congress for the work that you have done and continue to do to help us achieve this type of progress. So we are here today with the firm belief that in the United States of America, no senior should ever have to choose between whether they are able to fill a prescription or fill their refrigerator with food.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:04)', 'Speech': 'But for… yes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:14)', 'Speech': 'Because we know for years far too many of our seniors, millions of our seniors across the country have struggled to afford their prescriptions. And too many of our seniors risked their health as they may have delayed to refill their prescription or they cut their pills in half to try and stretch out the length of time that they could take their medication. So since we took office, President Biden and I and our administration has taken historic action to cut the cost of prescription medication for our seniors. We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. We’ll cap the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year. And we have made vaccines free of charge, which will save seniors hundreds of dollars every year. Yes. And we’ve finally allowed Medicare to negotiate the price of medications with big pharma companies, to benefit of 65 million Americans at least.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:44)', 'Speech': 'And as many of you know, we’ve worked together. Over the course of my career, I’ve seen the stakes of this fight firsthand. When I was Attorney General of California, I met with countless families who are often quietly suffering because they or a loved one could not afford the medication they needed and were prescribed. I investigated drug makers that tried to stop production of cheaper generic versions of their drugs, and we held them accountable. And we intervened in the merger of hospitals that could have resulted in less competition or increased cost for their patients. All that to say there are many factors that drive up healthcare costs and make medications more expensive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:30)', 'Speech': 'And President Biden and I will continue to use every tool at our disposal to bring these costs dow7n. And we will hold accountable those who try to put profits ahead of the health and wellbeing of the American people. And together, we will continue to build a nation where every person, not just the wealthy or well-connected, has the opportunity to thrive and can live a life of dignity after they retire. So that includes, of course, our next speaker. Please welcome Steven Hatfield. Thank you very much.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:41)', 'Speech': 'I also live with a rare blood cancer and type two diabetes, two health conditions that require very expensive drugs. Every month, the treatment I need to stay alive costs $16,000. I have been a hard worker all my life, and I always had to work multiple jobs simultaneously so I can afford my medications. My doctors have constantly warned me over the years, the strain for all these jobs could seriously impact my health. But I’m afraid if I retire, I won’t be able to afford what I need to survive. At times, I’ve had to forego or ration some of my drugs because they were just so expensive. No one in America should have to live this way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:31)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I am so grateful to President Biden for passing the Inflation Reduction Act. It already made a huge difference in my life. Instead of having to pay $400 per month for my insulin prescription, I now get it for $35. And soon Medicare will be able to negotiate lower prices for cancer drugs too. It’s given me an entirely new lease on life. For too long, drug makers have made a fortune while patients like me live in constant fear, wondering how we pay for our medicine. Thanks to President Biden, that’s changing. He’s finally ending Big Pharma’s one-sided pricing power and giving seniors like me a break. But it’s not just me. His actions are literally saving the lives of so many other patients and families across the country who are struggling to pay their medical bills. He gets it. And that’s why it is my greatest honor to introduce the man responsible for all these incredible changes, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:04)', 'Speech': 'Without them, you’re not going to be here. On too many nights, too many Americans lay in bed staring at the ceiling, worrying what will happen if their spouse gets sick, if their child gets sick or something else happens to them. I should have said at the outset, when I look out in the audience, there’s a lot of people who are in this fight, some even before me that it just is amazing. I want to thank you, the people sitting in front of me, the members of Congress, the organizations you’ve belonged to for making this happen. It wouldn’t happen without you. And that’s not hyperbole. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:42)', 'Speech': 'I’m serious. I’m deadly honest about it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:54)', 'Speech': 'I really am. So thank you. You know, questions you lie in bed, wonder about. I remember we lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with four… We weren’t poor. Just a normal middle class, I guess technically lower middle class family, but in the development of homes and the bulk of my childhood, that was a three-bedroom split-level home that had four kids and a grandpa living with us. And you could hear everything in the house. I remember one night, to God’s truth, I remember one night, I guess I was a sophomore or junior in high school and hearing the headboard of my dad’s, but I could tell my dad was restless in the next room. Next morning I get up and ask my mom, I said, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “The company just said they’re not going to pay insurance anymore.” Health insurance.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:43)', 'Speech': 'Well, that’s tough enough, but imagine when you have lifesaving drugs you need to keep you alive. Do you have enough insurance? Can you afford your medical bills? Do you have to sell the house in order to pay for everything? For all of you out there, I get it and millions of Americans get it. And I promise you, I’m going to have your back and I’ll never stop fighting for you on this issue, nor will Kamala. Nor will Kamala.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:09)', 'Speech': 'But again, I’m not being solicitous when I say for all of you sitting in the audience, this would never happened without you. Never would’ve happened without you. I’m not going to start naming names because I’m going to get in real trouble if I do that. But thank you. Two weeks ago, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, which in a sense is misnamed. We did lower inflation, but there are many other things in that legislation. One of the most significant laws ever enacted, especially when it comes to reducing the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for prescription drugs than any other major economy in the world. You can walk on a local drug tour across the country. You’re paying two to three times more for the exact same prescription manufactured by the exact same company than it would cost you in Canada, or France, or anywhere else around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:12)', 'Speech': 'Think about that. A drug company that makes a drug here in America, if it’s sold in Chicago, you can buy the same drug in Toronto or Paris cheaper than you can buy it in Toronto. I mean in Chicago. And unlike other parts of the healthcare system, big pharma got a special carve out that stopped Medicare from negotiating prices of drugs through Medicare. For years, advocates like many of you in this room, have worked tirelessly to change that and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. Just like the Department of Veterans Affairs does right now. It matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:54)', 'Speech': 'VA pays 50% less than Medicare can, and negotiating the same lower prices. For years, big pharma blocked us. They kept prescription drug prices high to increase their profits and extend patents on existing drugs to suppress fair competition, instead of innovating. Playing games in pricing so they could charge whatever they can. But this is finally, finally, finally… we had enough votes by a matter of one to beat Big Pharma. Well, we did it. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act with no help from the other team. Every single person on the other team in the Congress voted against it. Every single one. And we’re in a situation here the law finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. And by the way, negotiating drug prices alongside other provisions of this law isn’t just going to put more money back in the pockets of millions of Americans across the country. It’s also going to lower the federal deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:10)', 'Speech': 'According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will save the federal government 160 billion over the next 10 years because Medicare won’t be paying less for the prescription drugs they’re making available to seniors. The Inflation Reduction Act is already making a huge difference. Take insulin as referenced by Steven. That drug cost $10 to make. The guy who invented the drug who came up with it, didn’t patent it because he wanted it available for everybody, but drug companies are charging 30 times that $10, or more than that. Now because of the Inflation Reduction Act, seniors on Medicare like Steve are paying $35 a month instead of $400 a month. It matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:57)', 'Speech': 'Three months after the Inflation Reduction Act went into effect, all three of the major insulin manufacturers lowered their prices for insulin for everyone. For everyone. Not just seniors, everyone. That’s originally what I had proposed. Everyone. We lost on getting everyone, but we kept seniors. When we act, change happens. And today I’m proud to announce that Medicare has selected the first 10 additional drugs for negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act. 10 additional. Drugs that treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, kidney disease, arthritis, blood cancers, Crohn’s disease, and so much more. Medicare spends $50 billion a year on these 10 drugs. And American seniors are spending 3.4 billion on out-of-pocket cost. Look, if you compare the total drug price globally, the United States is clearly an outlier. For example, one of the selected drugs that treats blood clots costs about $80 for a monthly prescription in Canada.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:07)', 'Speech': 'The same exact drug in the United States made by the same exact company cost over $270 a month made by the same company here, sold in the United States America. Triple the cost just crossing the border. Think about that. Big Pharma is charging Americans more than three times what they charge other countries simply because they could. And I think it’s outrageous. That’s why these negotiations matter. Reducing the cost of these 10 additional drugs alone will help more than nine million Americans. And by September 2024, HHS, Health and Human Services is going to publish the prices it negotiated. In January of 2026, the new prices will go into effect. But we’re not stopping there. Next year, Medicares will select more drugs for negotiation, so more Americans get more savings on lifesaving medications they need and deserve.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:09)', 'Speech': 'But guess what? Big Pharma doesn’t want this to happen, as you might expect. Last year the industry spent $400 million in lobbying fees to try to stop the Inflation Reduction Act and block the ability of the federal government to lower drug prices. And when they failed, they went to federal court to sue the government in attempt to maintain their exorbitant prices. They’re hoping the courts will do what Democrats and Congress wouldn’t do; protect the exorbitant profits and keep negotiations from happening. But we’re going to see this through. We’re going to keep standing up to Big Pharma and we’re not going to back down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:02)', 'Speech': 'Folks, there was a lot of really great Republicans out there, and I mean that sincerely. But we’ll stand up to the MAGA Republicans who voted against Inflation Reduction Act and now are attempting to still repeal it in the name of the MAGA Republicans who have been trying for years to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Deny tens of millions of Americans access to quality affordable healthcare. Today is the start of a new deal for patients where big pharma doesn’t just get a blank check at your expense and the expense of the American people. On my watch, healthcare should be right, not a privilege in this country. There are other ways the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering healthcare costs as well. As mentioned, beginning in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act caps total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year total. Even if their expenses…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:13)', 'Speech': 'Even for expensive cancer drugs that could cost 10, 12, $14,000 a year max, cumulative, $2,000. The law already requiring that drug companies that raise prices faster than inflation have to pay the difference to the government between what they charge and the rate of inflation. This quarter, seniors are paying up to $449 less per dose for drugs that hike their prices faster than inflation. In addition to the law, my administration is cracking down on junk health insurance plans that look like they’re inexpensive, but too often stick consumers with big hidden fees. No one likes to be taken advantage of. We’re also cracking down on surprise medical bills. You’ve all heard of the stories of people who choose a hospital that’s in their insurance network, then get a surprise bill of thousands of dollars because the hospital assigned an anesthesiologist, for example, who wasn’t in their network.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:16)', 'Speech': 'Well, not anymore. Preventing one million surprise medical bills every single month when we have changed this law. Loan prescription drug costs is part of a much broader vision for the country. Growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom-up, not from the top-down. Because when the middle class does well, everyone does well. I’m a capitalist. If you make a billion dollars, fine. Just pay a little bit in taxes. Everyone does well when we do it this way. The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal, I don’t think they meant it as a compliment originally started referring to my economic policy as Bidenomics. Well, guess what? It’s working.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:05)', 'Speech': 'Since we were sworn in January 2021, the economy has created more than 13 million new jobs since I took office on that day. We’ve created more jobs in two years than any president has in a single four-year term. Unemployment has been below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years, and now we have more jobs than we did before the pandemic. Workers aren’t just finding more jobs, they’re finding better jobs, higher paying jobs and job satisfaction. The rate of Americans without health insurance is at an all time low. Premiums for coverage for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act are $800 lower per person than before I took office.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:57)', 'Speech': 'While we have more to do, inflation is down by two thirds. Inflation is now down close to 3%, the lowest among the world’s leading economies, with wages growing faster than inflation. This matters to ordinary people. The way I think about inflation, the way my dad talked about it around the kitchen table, he’d say, “The real issue is how much do you have after you pay all your monthly bills? What’s left? How much do you have leftover to pay for necessities? Will there be enough room at the end of the month just to have a little bit of breathing room?” Well, the Inflation Reduction Act is giving more breathing room, especially when it comes to healthcare costs. Way I look at it, Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the American dream. I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live, raise their kids on a good paycheck, take care of their healthcare for their families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:05)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to have another expression for real. And the kids I grew up, the guys I grew up with, remember it. He said, “Joey, your job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay,” and mean it.” That’s part of the American dream.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:27)', 'Speech': 'Let me conclude with this. I’m proud of the historic laws my administration has passed. Through the right steps, not only get our economy moving again, but to build a future better than the past. I’m not trying to return to the past. I’m trying to build a better future than we have. And it’s not about me. It’s about you, the American people. We’ve faced pretty tough times in recent years, but the American people didn’t give up. They never give up. You’re the ones getting up every single day doing the work. You’re the real heroes in this story. We all hear from our friends on other side of the aisle about what they claim is wrong with America. They tell you we’re failing, that America’s failing. Well, they’re wrong. America isn’t failing. America is winning. And as I said 1,000 times, there is no quit in America. None.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:29)', 'Speech': 'I’ve said it more than 1,000 times. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. This is still a country that believes in honesty, decency, and integrity. And we’re still a country that believes in hard work. We’re still a country that believes in each and every one of us is created equal and deserves an equal chance, and we’re still the beacon for the entire world. Everyday ordinary people do extraordinary things. That’s who we are. So let me tell you, America’s best days are ahead of us. They’re ahead of us. They’re not in the past. They’re ahead of us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:59)', 'Speech': 'And this is all about the future. This is about each of us writing the next chapter in American history. That’s why I’ve never been… I mean this, I’ve been saying this for a long time. I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. Nothing. I’m not joking. Think about it. No goal we’ve ever set have we failed to meet when we’ve worked together. So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Better days are coming.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:30)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:30)', 'Speech': 'First get up there. I want to take your picture. [inaudible 00:27:12].'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:30)', 'Speech': 'We’re arch rivals. Arch rivals. We go way back. We go way back.'}]"

And we’ve represented Dwight Evans, a good friend, and Brendan Boyle’s always there for me. And Mary Kay Scanlon. Mary Kay Scanlon has been a great friend as well. And look, former member Charlene Parker, where’s Charlene? She’s here? I know I saw her. Well, I know the next mayor. I was about to do that. I was going to see her first. You want to come up here and do this old buddy? I told when I ran for president, I told you I’d have your back, and I have. There are a lot of politicians in this country who don’t know how to say the word union. They talk about labor. They don’t say union. It’s union. I’m proud to say union. I’m proud to be the most pro-union president according to the experts in American history. And by the way, I make no bones about that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:56)', 'Speech': 'Folks, in this Labor Day, let me tell you what we’re celebrating. We’re celebrating jobs, good paying jobs. Jobs you can raise a family on, union jobs. You’ve heard me say it before, but my dad used to have an expression. I swear to God. He said, “Joey, a jobs about a lot more than a paycheck, for real. It’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘It’s going to be okay,’ and mean it when you say it.” And he was right. And I’m determined to make that a reality for every family in this country. And we are making it a reality. Nearly 13,500,000 jobs just since you got me sworn in, in January of 2020. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But you wouldn’t know from all the negative news you hear. Well, we’re getting through this. One of the greatest job creation periods in American history. For real. That’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:58)', 'Speech': 'And it wasn’t that long ago, we we’re losing jobs in this country. In fact, the guy who held this job before me was just one of two presidents in history. But there’s an important point. He was one of two presidents that left office with fewer jobs in America than when he got elected office. By the way, you know who the other one was? Herbert Hoover. Isn’t that coincidental? Look, but we’re turning things around because of you. When the last guy was here, you were shipping jobs to China. Now we’re bringing jobs home from China. When the last guy was here, when the last guy was here, your pensions were at risk. We helped save millions of pensions with your help. When the last guy was here, he looked at the world from Park Avenue. I look at it from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I look at it from Claymont, Delaware. Not a joke. Folks, all my time in public office, I’ve been referred to as middle class Joe. I guess they thought that was somehow not very complimentary. Well, guess what? That’s who I am. And doesn’t mean you’re not sophisticated because you’re middle class, it means you’ve worked like hell and you know what? Your family has to work like hell to be able to make it. Well, I’m awful sophisticated about one thing. I know who built this country. I’ve been saying this since I ran the first time. Let me say it loud and clear, Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class. That’s a fact. That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. Unions built the middle class.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:47)', 'Speech': 'I look at this crowd. I see folks in my neighborhood. I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. The people of physical courage and brains. People who busted their necks their whole lives to care for their families. People who got up every day and worked like the devil to pay their taxes and volunteer in their communities. You’re too modest. You don’t talk enough about what you have to do. But I tell you, leaders all the time, American Union workers are the best. And this is what I tell every major head of state in the world, not a joke, just because I’ve been around and they look to America for foreign policy issues. And guess what? I make the point, america has the best workers in the world. That’s a fact. And you guys ought to talk about it more. It can take four to five years to train as an apprentice. It’s like going back to college. The jobs are constantly changing. The technology evolves. You have to keep stepping up. You have to get more training.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:50)', 'Speech': 'So you can’t be the worst in the world, you’re the best in the world. No, I really mean it. Like the sheet metal workers who used to use hand-drawn blueprints to design duct work in buildings, now use sophisticated computer aided design systems so the entire project can be laid out in 3D. It ain’t your father’s sheet metal workers. This is a different world, man. You do the job right and you do it on time and your cost less for the guy you’re doing it for the outfit you’re doing it for than if they didn’t have labor. People are starting to understand. I met with the Business Roundtable. They’re the big shots in the corporate America. And they said, “Why are you so pro-labor?” I said, “Why you don’t understand why I’m pro-labor?” No, I’m serious.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:42)', 'Speech': 'And I said, when I was vice president, I spoke with 364, I think it was, CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies, and we asked them, “What do you most need?” You know what they said? “A better educated workforce.”I said, “Well, what the hell are you doing about it? You’re not doing much about it. You’re fighting everything we’re doing in the unions as well as in the Democratic Party to make people better educated. Why are you doing it?” Well, guess what? All of a sudden now, you don’t see them going after you nearly as much. Why? Because they know they need you. America’s support for union is higher today than any time in nearly 60 years. And I’m continuing to call on Congress to fully and finally pass the Protecting the Right to Organize, the PRO Act, which makes it easier. Too many companies are still playing unfair, trying to prevent organization.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:39)', 'Speech': 'Though the bill’s named after one of the greatest leaders in labor I’ve ever worked with, Rich Trumka. And guess what? We’re going to get it passed, come hell or high water. And folks, my plan for the country is to make the economy work for people like you. Because when it works for people like you, it works for everybody. Like I said, in my first two years, I’ve created nearly 13.5 million jobs, more jobs in two years than any president’s created in a four year term, more. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Where’s it written? Where is it written that America will not lead the world of manufacturing? I don’t see it written anywhere because we are leading the world. Unemployment has been below 4% for the longest stretch in 50 years. We’ve recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic, we’ve added millions more. People are coming off the sidelines to go to work. More than 700,000 people joined the labor force last month, which means higher share of working age Americans are now in the workforce at any time in the last 20 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:55)', 'Speech': 'Job satisfaction is higher than it’s been in 36 years. While unemployment is down, inflation is down as well. Remember the expert said, “To get inflation down,” It’s been the mantra of economists for a long time, “You need to get inflation under control. You need to lower wages and need higher unemployment.” Not on my watch. That’s right. The answer was to lay people off and pay them less. But I never thought the problem was too many people working or working people making too much money. I’ve never seen that problem. We have to do more to put inflation down, but it’s down around 3%, 1/3 of what it was a year ago. That’s near the lowest point in two years. And wages are going faster than inflation. Folks, this just didn’t happen. Together we made it happen. Decades of handing out excessive tax cuts to the rich and the corporations without making the investments in the American people. That had been a bust. It’s was all done to hollow out the middle class, blow up the deficit, ship jobs'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:39)', 'Speech': 'Because this is not a political statement. This is an economic statement. When the middle class does well, everyone does well. I’m a capitalist. The poor do well. And guess what? You can still be a millionaire, a billionaire, except one thing, pay your taxes. Pay your taxes. Bidenomics is a blue collar blueprint for America. It’s for you. For example, last week we announced a new proposal, a new rule that would extend overtime pay to as many as 3,600,000 workers. Now it’s about 35 grand or 36 grand before. After that you don’t get overtime. Well, now it’s 53 grand, man. And guess what? Because you got a whole lot of people working as executive assistants, working a hell of a lot more than 40 hours and not getting paid overtime, now you’re going to get paid overtime.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:40)', 'Speech': 'It’ll make a big difference for a lot of families. We did something else that mattered a whole lot to folks in this parking lot. We passed the Butch Lewis Act, which protected pensions from millions of union workers. There’s one of the most significant achievements for union workers and retirees in over 50 years. And for the folks at home who don’t know why it matters, let me explain. Two to 3 million union workers through no fault of their own after paying their pension for years faced painful cuts and benefits. They were counting on in retirement, why? They were going to be left high and dry while companies they worked for didn’t hold up their end of the bargain and finance their end of the bargain.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:26)', 'Speech': 'We just couldn’t let that happen. And I might add, we got it passed and not a single solitary Republican vote, not one voted to sustain these pensions. People worked their whole life. No, think about it though. Why in the hell would they do that? Can you imagine if it was reversed? Can you imagine? They came along and said… Anyway, I don’t want to get going. Democrats passed it because Democrats know the value of hard work. We also passed the bipartisan infrastructure law. You can’t have the strongest economy in the world with a second rate infrastructure. Can you believe we used to have the best infrastructure in the world and then we fell to number 13 in the world? Roads, bridges, Internet, the whole deal. 13th, the United States America 13th in the world. But guess what? Guess what? The great real estate builder, the last guy here, he didn’t build a damn thing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:27)', 'Speech': 'Under my predecessor, infrastructure week became a punchline. On my watch, infrastructure is being a decade and it’s a headline. And folks, we’re investing in America, our roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more. Over $10 billion has already been committed to the state of Pennsylvania. We’ve already announced 78 million going to the city of Philadelphia to make improvements along the approximately 12.3 miles of Roosevelt Boulevard and North Broad Street. The Bucks County line, including upgrades or traffic signals, installing new transit and bike paths, pedestrian paths.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:11)', 'Speech': 'We’re upgrading the airports from Pittsburgh to Lehigh Valley right here in Philly. And you got it. 95, we got it. I got it, man. I got it. And Bobby Casey, we’re finally going to get that rail line from Scranton to New York. I’m going to get that done. My grandpa. You think I’m joking? I’m not joking. It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal. And economically, it’ll be a big deal. Economically, be a big deal. And guess who’s going to build these projects? You are. Labor. Union labor. Sheet metal workers, electricians, operating engineers, iron workers, steel workers, laborers, bricklayers, plumbers, pipe fills, cement masons, painters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:04)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re creating good paying prevailing wage jobs where you don’t need a college degree to make a decent income, but you got to work as hard to get a college degree. And by the way, we’re going to transition to electric vehicle future made in America. It will be made in America, and that protects and expands good union jobs. Auto manufacturing has largely been a middle class career with good pay that you could raise a family on. Well, that’s not going to change on my watch. Look, one of the core principles throughout everything we’ve done is this, make it an America with American products, with American labor. Most people don’t know there’s been a federal law on the books. And 20 years ago, I didn’t know it either, to be honest with you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:56)', 'Speech': 'Since 1933, the law says that when Congress appropriates money for the president to administer, whether it’s for an aircraft carrier or a federal highway, the president is supposed to hire American workers and use only American products. But guess what? For too long, too many presidents didn’t have the nerve to insist on it. Well, I’m insisting on it. When I took office, I was determined that we’d never again be in a position where during the pandemic, supply chains broke down and American companies couldn’t get the parts and products they needed. So I was determined to bring the supply chains home, to invest in America. And guess what? And that’s encouraging the private sector to do the same.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:45)', 'Speech': 'Since I took office, the private companies are investing their money, $510 billion investing in America, creating jobs instead of sending it overseas. For example, I met with the chairman of one of the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world. And by the way, we invented the semiconductor. We used to have 40% of the market. Well, it’s based in South Korea, this group, it’s called SK Group. They’re investing $22 billion in America, building facilities to make these chips here in America. When I asked the CEO, “Why, why America?” Here’s what he said, number one, “There’s no safer place in the world to have my investment than the United States of America.” And number two, this is to God’s truth. “You have the best workers in the world.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:37)', 'Speech': 'He was right on both counts. The long and short is we’re making things here in America, again with American workers and American products and American factories. For too long we’ve been exporting jobs. Corporations are shutting down factories throughout the country from Pennsylvania to all through the Midwest. For communities, generations having worked in a particular factory get shipped overseas because labor was cheaper, depriving that county and that city of pride, sending jobs overseas and importing finished products from overseas. But we’re not doing that anymore. We’re creating good paying union jobs and exporting union made products to the rest of the world. And maybe equally important, we’re bringing back pride to those scores of cities across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:26)', 'Speech': 'I believe Americans who are willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live in the heartland, small towns, big cities, raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep the roots where they grew up. And even with what we’ve done, unlike the last president in my first two years, all this stuff, guess what? I cut the deficit $1.7 trillion. Cut the debt, $1.7 trillion. And one more thing. One of the ways I was able to invest in you and still bring down the deficit was I started making people pay their fair share. You may remember hearing me say this, for the longest time, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500, paid zero in federal taxes. Making $40 billion, they paid zero. Well, guess what? It’s not fair, but I changed it. Now, they’re paying a minimum of 15%, paying for all this stuff. By the way, how many of you think the tax code is fair? You got it, man. You know the idea that there are over a thousand billionaires, billionaires. Billion, not million. Billionaires in America. You know what they pay in federal taxes? On average 8%. How many of you want to… If I had a deal, said, “Okay, no matter what you do, you only have to pay 8%. Raise your head.” You’d take it in the heartbeat, right? Well, they pay a lower rate than you, than teachers, firefighters, and probably anyone in this parking lot. It’s time we get paid. They pay at least a minimum tax. The bottom line is this, you pay enough. It’s time for big corporations, the very wealthy, to start paying their fair share. And I made a promise when I got elected, so there’d be no mistakes that no one making under 400,000… Any of you’re making for over 400 grand here?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:24)', 'Speech': 'No one making under $400,000 will see the federal taxes go up a single penny. So I couldn’t be use… The malarkey that they say I’m raising taxes on middle class people. I made my promise and I’ll keep it. Let me close with this. We’ve faced some pretty tough times in recent years. The pandemic took more than a million of our friends and neighbors, sons and daughters. There’s a lot of empty chairs at Christmas, a lot of empty chairs when you sit down for Thanksgiving. Mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife. It generated the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It wasn’t that long ago that 20 million people were out of work, but you didn’t give up. Philadelphia didn’t give up. America didn’t give up. As I said a thousand times, there is no quit in America. None.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:24)', 'Speech': 'All I hear from my friends on the other side, what they say is wrong with America. They keep telling us America’s failing. They’re wrong. I’ve got news for them. America has the strongest economy in the world right now, today. Lowest inflation rate among any major economy. 13.5 million new jobs. And there’s no one reason for it. It’s not because of me. Although our products have helped, not just the Democratic Party, it’s you. I mean it sincerely. Not a joke. It’s the American people. Your grit, determination, you never quit. Whatever we set'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:55)', 'Speech': 'Well, that obligation is sacred to prepare and equip you all and to deal with you when you come home. Folks, we’ve taken the right steps not only to get our economy moving again, but to build to the future. And the real hero in this story is you. I’m not being solicitous. The American people, the people of Philadelphia, the working people of this country, you’re the ones getting up every day, walking out that door, and doing your work. And I’ve long said it’s never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it’s not a good bet today. We’re still a country that believes in honesty and decency and integrity. We’re still a country that believes in hard work and giving everyone a fair shot because there’s still a country that believes that every one of us is created equal. We’re still the beacon of the free world, not a joke.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:43)', 'Speech': 'And it’s because small towns and rural America, suburbs, big cities all across the country, every ordinary people do the most extraordinary things. Let me tell you, America’s best days are ahead of us. They’re ahead of us, not behind us. It’s about the future. This is about the future. And lately I can honestly say I’ve been doing this a long while, but I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops. You’re the best. You’re the best. You really are the best. Thank you. Thank you. They tell me if I work the rope line, we’re going to slow the parade up, so I’m not going to do that today.

https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-remarks-on-a-new-contract-covering-americas-west-coast-ports-transcript,2023-09-07,President Biden Delivers Remarks on a New Contract Covering America’s West Coast Ports Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:51)', 'Speech': 'At long last, they’ve reached an agreement because they stuck with it. It has been ratified with overwhelming support by union members, I think over 70% if I’m not mistaken. And I just met with the leaders of the ILWU, including President, and I knew Willie for a long time, Willie Adams, who’s the leader there. I was kidding him, I said I want to know who his haberdasher is. He looks awful good, doesn’t he? I like that coat, and the leaders of the Pacific Maritime Association and CEO, Jim McKenna. Jim, thank you and congratulations on getting this deal done. I also want to recognize Julie Su, my assistant, my acting Secretary of Labor, who used her deep experience to keep tough negotiations going and, I am told by both sides, helped close the deal. I want to thank both sides for working through this and for getting it done. It’s a good deal for workers. It’s a good deal for companies and it’s a good deal for the United States of America. This landmark contract covers 29 ports, stretching from San Diego, California and Bellingham, Washington that play a major role in our nation’s economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:58)', 'Speech': 'More comes through those ports than any other mains of getting into the United States of America. It’s gigantic, gigantic economic impact. For example, the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which I’ve visited both, are covered by this deal. They handle 40%, 40% of the nation’s cargo containers every single year. With this contract, dock workers at those 29 Pacific ports will get a pay benefit and working conditions that I believe they deserve and apparently have agreed upon. That includes the guaranteed 32% pay increase over a six-year period. It also includes a one-time bonus for the dock worker’s exceptional efforts during the pandemic, during the pandemic, and it matters. We all remember how the ports around the world were congested due to disruption caused by the pandemic. During my first year as president ahead of the holiday season, my administration brought together port operators and shipping companies and labor to do everything they could to ease the bottlenecks for that Christmas season. And America’s long shore workers stepped up with extraordinary measures, including working around the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week to keep the cargo moving.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:11)', 'Speech': 'It worked, working with port operations. About 97% of the packages were delivered on time for the holidays or with only minimal delays, and I want to thank the port operators for that as well. Delivery times were actually quicker than before the pandemic. Our dock workers did that and I want to thank them, and the port operators and our nation’s ports moved record levels of cargo in 2021. Then we moved record cargo again in 2022. And today thanks to the American workers, including the Longshore workers and truckers, rail workers, America supply chains, they’re operating smoothly. Again with this agreement, they’re being paid what they deserve and goods are moving quickly and efficiently across the country. Plus, this has a direct impact on reducing inflation. When the cost of moving goods through supply chains goes up, inflation goes up, strengthening supply chains and inflation goes down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:16)', 'Speech': 'That’s why we made fixing our supply chains to bring down inflation a top priority and it’s working. Today, inflation is down to around 3%, about one third of what it was one year ago. That’s nearest lowest point in over two years. This contract proves that collective bargaining works. It gives workers a seat at the table and ensures that their wellbeing, security and futures are a priority, and it also gives employers the opportunity, it delivers for employers by helping them attract and retain the best, most productive workers in the world. Yes, it often takes time, but done right, collective bargaining means everyone wins, workers, employers, our economy and consumers. That’s why I also want to congratulate another labor agreement. The Teamsters overwhelmingly ratified their contract with UPS last month. UPS is the largest single employer contract in all of North America covering 340,000 workers, and thanks to that contract, those workers will see significant pay increases, improved working condition, brief relief from the heat and delivery trucks by eliminating the tier system, which unfairly paid some drivers lower wages than others doing the same exact job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:38)', 'Speech': 'With this historic contract, our Teamsters are going to continue to deliver UPS goods across the country and our supply chains will continue working the way they should, and these labor agreements build on other actions we’ve taken. During the pandemic, ocean carriers increased their prices as much as 1000% costing farmers, ranchers and our economy a lot of money. But last year I signed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, cracking down on foreign shipping companies that were making American pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country. Since then, we’ve seen ocean shipping container rates come down to near pre-pandemic levels. And under the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which we passed, we’re making long overdue investments to upgrade our nation’s railroads, highways, airports and ports.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:30)', 'Speech': 'The Infrastructure Law recognizes the vital role of modern resilient infrastructure in reducing costs for American families and businesses, and in creating good paying union jobs for American workers. All of this progress underscores something else, you’ve heard me say many times, including this Labor Day, Wall Street alone didn’t build this country. The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class. American Union workers are the best in the world and they do their job on time, long-term and at less costs over time. People are starting to understand that, that’s why America’s support for unions is higher than it’s been in nearly 60 years. And to anyone who asks whether unions really make a difference, I urge them to read the new report from the Treasury Department which was released last week. It’s the most comprehensive ever look at the impact of unions have had on our economy, and it concludes definitively that union raise workers’ income, increase American home ownership, creating more jobs, increase retirement savings, increase access to critical benefits like sick leave and childcare, and reducing equity and all of which strengthens our economy up and down the line.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:53)', 'Speech': 'When the middle class does well, everyone does well and the wealthy still do very, very well. Plus even workers who aren’t in unions, even workers who haven’t been laid off, see benefits when unions are strong because unions raise standards across the workforce and industries pushing up wages, strengthening benefits and strengthening them for everyone. That’s why I’m continuing to call on Congress to fully and finally pass the Protection of the Right to Organize Act, the Pro Act, which makes it easier for workers to organize unions and more difficult for businesses to engage in unfair practices.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:29)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. We faced some pretty tough times in recent years. A pandemic that took more than a million of our friends and neighbors and our families was the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, major disruptions to critical supply chains. It wasn’t long ago that 20 million people were out of work here in America, 20 million, but the American people and American workers didn’t give up. Today, we have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say that again. Today, United States has the strongest economy in the world, the lowest inflation rate among all major economies, and 13.5 million new jobs, around 800,000 of them in manufacturing jobs. America’s now one of the strongest, going through one of the strongest job creation periods in our nation’s history, and it’s no accident. I came determined to build an economy, as I said before, from the middle out and the bottom up, because everyone does well when the middle class does well and the wealthy do very well. And look, to invest in American workers who are the backbone of the country makes sense to me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:41)', 'Speech': 'The labor contracts we celebrate today prove that. And while I’m proud of all the steps my administration has taken to strengthening the economy, the real hero in this story are the American people, ordinary people getting up every morning, walking out, busting their necks, believing and doing their work, showing up, they’re the ones making this happen, and they remind us who we are. I’ve said it many times and I make no apologies for it, with United States of America, there is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Think about it, name me one major issue that we’ve set our mind on solving we haven’t been able to do. So God bless you all. Thanks for what you did. Thanks, and may we continue to have this economic growth and may God protect our troops. Thank you all so very, very much. Thank you.'}]"

This future library will provide the beating heart and soul to help further the causes John so dearly believed in, and will be the impetus to bring them back to where they belong, to the place that he loved so, Arizona.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:24)', 'Speech': 'The road ahead is just beginning, but we know where it will lead. John would have hated if we’d made this occasion just about him, but instead, he would have wanted to make it about what is most important, John’s constant mantra of service to a cause greater than one’s self-interest and this will be embodied here within this project.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:48)', 'Speech': 'From nurturing the flame of democracy, calling others to a cause of character-driven leadership, or championing the issues most important to Arizonans, his indomitable spirit will live on through the actions and the ideals that we will imbue here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:08)', 'Speech': 'There is no more starkly manifest personification of these causes and how they bring us together than the fact that President Biden is here to get us underway. While John and he differed on many political issues through their respective careers, the great causes that brought them together and were most important to our nation are shared in this venture.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:36)', 'Speech': 'It is my true hope that it will also serve as a motivation to inspire a new generation to take on the mantle of public service and to fight for the worthy causes they believe in, just as John did. We would not be capable of this great undertaking without the efforts of countless friends and advocates. I cannot thank those who have brought us here today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:04)', 'Speech': 'To name a few, of course, the McCain family, Gov. Ducey, Gov. Hobbs and, of course, President Biden. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:18)', 'Speech': 'And we know that your faith and assistance are the foundation of the great work that lays ahead.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:33)', 'Speech': 'And now in true John McCain fashion, we have much to do. I’m going to introduce the President, but give me just a second to add a special note if I may.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:44)', 'Speech': 'I don’t know that many of you even know this. I was a young woman teaching special education and I went on spring break with my parents to Hawaii. And while I was there, we were invited to this glorious reception held on behalf of a Senate delegation on their way to China. During the course of that event, there were two people that came over to me and said, “You have got to meet this man in this room.” President Biden and Mrs. Biden introduced me to my husband and I am so grateful for that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:24)', 'Speech': 'It is my sincere honor to introduce to you, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:34)', 'Speech': 'I’m going to put a little bit more meat on that bone, that last one. John and I used to travel together. When John got back from all the time in Vietnam in prison, when he was released, he decided he wanted to go back to stay in the military. And he was assigned to the United States Senate and to the military office there that travels with senators when they travel abroad. And John and I put in a couple hundred thousand miles together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:34)', 'Speech': 'And on our way to, I think I was going to either China, I forget what the destination was, China, I think. And we stopped in Hawaii. And the Chief Naval of Operations was there showing me around. They did an event for me. And John kept looking at your mom. Oh, I’m serious. And he said, “Gosh, she’s beautiful.” And I said, “Yes, she is, John.” And I said, “Well, you to go up and say hi to her.” He said, “No, no, no, no, no, no. I’m not going to do that.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:07)', 'Speech': 'Well, as your mom come… I won’t go into more detail, but I’ll tell you: I insisted that they meet. And I take credit. I take credit for you guys.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:18)', 'Speech': 'And I just told your mom: John and I had something in common, we both married way above our station, way above our station.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:29)', 'Speech': 'Cindy, or I should call you Madam Ambassador, thank you for all you’ve done, all you do, you continue to do. Jack and Bridget, the entire McCain family, and to all those who love the McCain family.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:46)', 'Speech': 'Oh, I didn’t see all up there. Whoa. Don’t jump. Don’t jump.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:54)', 'Speech': 'Well, I tell you what, it’s an honor to be with you. It’s a genuine honor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:57)', 'Speech': 'Gov. Hobbs, you’ve done an incredible job. You’ve been a leader and defender of democracy. And you’ve always been available when I’ve called, and I hope I’ve been available when you called as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:08)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, in the end, John McCain thought about the beginning. Five years ago, as John was dying from brain cancer, John wrote a farewell letter to the nation that he said that he served so well in both war and in peace.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:31)', 'Speech': 'His words tracked back centuries to America’s founding and then toward a triumphant future. Here’s what John wrote, and I quote, “We are citizens of the world, the world’s greatest republic. A nation of ideals, not blood and soil. Americans never quit. They never hide from history. America makes history.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:58)', 'Speech': 'And John was right. Every other nation in the world has been founded on either a grouping by ethnicity, religion, background. We’re the most unique nation in the world. We’re founded on an idea, the only major nation in the world founded on an idea. An idea that we are all created equal in the image of God, endowed by our Creator to be able to be treated equally throughout our lives. We’ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we’ve never walked away from it. But there’s danger we’re walking too far away from it now, the way we talk in this country. Because a long line of patriots like John McCain kept it from ever becoming something other than what it is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:43)', 'Speech': 'I often think about our friendship of 40 years. The hammer-and-tong debates we’d have in the Senate. We were like two brothers. We’d argue like hell. I mean really go at one another. Then we’d go lunch together. No, not a joke. Or John would ride home with me. I mean, we traveled the world together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:04)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, when he found this magnificent woman and got married, I’m the guy that convinced him to run in Arizona as a Republican. Bless me, Father, for… No, but you’ve got to admit, Cindy, I did. I talked to him, and I said, “John, you can do this job. My only worry is you’ll do it too well.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:28)', 'Speech': 'But, look, running on opposite sides of the nation’s highest office when he was running for president and I was on the vice presidential ticket, we still remained friends. The conversations he had with my son, Beau, the attorney general of the state of Delaware, a decorated major in the US Army, was a guy who spent a year in Iraq, about serving in a war overseas, about the courage in battle against the same cancer that took John and my son.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:44)', 'Speech': 'While in Illinois, I visited a marker depicting where John had endured all the pain, imprisoned five and a half years, solitary confinement for two years, given an opportunity, an opportunity to come home if he just said a couple things. He was beaten, bloodied, bones broken, isolated, tortured, left unable to raise his arms above his shoulders again. As I stood there paying my respects, I thought about how much I miss my friend, and it’s not hyperbole. From the bottom of my heart, I mean this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:23)', 'Speech': 'I thought about something else as well. I thought about how much America missed John right now, how much America needed John’s courage and foresight and vision. I thought about what John stood for, what he fought for, what he was willing to die for. I thought about what we owed John, what I owed him and what we owe each other as well, Americans as well. You see, and John’s one of those patriots, when they die, their voices are never silent. They still speak to us. They tug at both our hearts and our conscience, and they pose the most profound questions. Who are we? What do we stand for? What do we believe? What will we be?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:15)', 'Speech': 'For John, it was country first. Sounds like a movie, but it’s real with John. Honor, duty, decency, freedom, liberty, democracy, and now history has brought us to a new time of testing. Very few of us will ever be asked to endure what John McCain endured, but all of us are being asked right now; what will we do to maintain our democracy? Will we, as John wrote, never quit? Will we not hide from history, but make history? Will we put partisanship aside and put country first? I say we must and we will. We will.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:10)', 'Speech': 'But it’s not easy. It’s not easy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:13)', 'Speech': 'These principles of democracy are essential in a free society, but they have always been embattled. Today, let’s be clear, while we’ve made progress, democracy is still at risk. This is not hyperbole, it’s a simple truth. A simple truth. I’ve made the defense and protection and preservation of American democracy the central issue of my presidency. From the speech I made at Gettysburg, an Inaugural Address, to the anniversary of June 6th insurrection… No, January 6th insurrection, to Independence Hall in Philadelphia, to the speech I made at Union Station in Washington. I’ve spoken about the danger of election denialism, political violence, and the battle for the soul of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:02)', 'Speech': 'Today in America, to honor an institution devoted to the defensive of democracy, named in honor of a true patriot, I’m here to speak about another threat to our democracy that we all too often ignore, the threat to our political institutions, to our Constitution itself and the very character of our nation. Democracy is maintained by adhering to the Constitution and the march to perfecting our union by protecting and expanding rights with each successive generation, including that little guy. He’s going to talk about it. And it’s okay. In my house, kids prevail, okay?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:40)', 'Speech': 'This adherence isn’t optional. We can’t be situational. We can’t be only there when it’s good for yourself. It’s constant and unyielding, even when it’s easy and most important, when it’s hard. For centuries, the American Constitution has been a model for the world with other countries adopting “We the People” as their North Star as well. But as we know, we know how damaged our institutions of democracy, the judiciary, the legislature, the executive, have become in the eyes of the American people, even the world, from attacks from within the past few years. I know virtually every major world leader, that’s what I did when I was a senator, as vice president, and now. Everywhere I go in the world, I’ve met now with over a hundred heads of state of the nations of the world. Everywhere I go, they look and they ask the question, “Is it going to be okay?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:43)', 'Speech': 'Think about this, the first meeting I attended of the G7, the seven wealthiest nations in the world, in Europe, the NATO meeting, I sat down. It was in January, after being elected, so late January, or early February and it was in England. And I sat down and I said, “America’s back.” Macron looked at me and he said, “Mr. President, for how long? For how long?” And then, the Chancellor of Germany said, “Mr. President, what would you think if you pick up the paper tomorrow, tomorrow the London Times, and it said a thousand people broke down the doors of parliament, marched and killed two bobbies in order to overthrow an election of the new prime minister? What would you think then? What would America think?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:36)', 'Speech': 'What would we think? The leading nation in the world, having gone through what we went through. And many of you travel internationally, many of you know people from around the world. I’d be surprised if you heard anything different than the concern about; are we okay? Is the democracy going to be sustained? For that institutional'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:33)', 'Speech': 'And there is something dangerous happening in America now. There is an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy: the MAGA Movement. Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans adhere to the MAGA extremist ideology. I know because I’ve been able to work with Republicans my whole career. But there is no question that today’s Republican Party is driven and intimidated by MAGA Republican extremists. Their extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:07)', 'Speech': 'My friends, they’re not hiding their attacks. They’re openly promoting them, attacking the free press as the enemy of the people, attacking the rule of law as an impediment, fomenting voter suppression and election subversion. Did you ever think we’d be having debates in the stage of your careers where banning books, and burying history, extremists in Congress more determined to shut down the government, to burn the place down than to let the people’s business be done?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:42)', 'Speech': 'Our U.S. military, and this in not a hyperbole, I’ve said it for the last two years, is the strongest military in the history of the world. Not just the strongest in the world, in the history of the world. It’s the most diverse, the most powerful in the history of the world. And it’s being accused of being weak and “woke” by the opposition. One guy in Alabama is holding up the promotion of hundreds of these officers. Frankly, these extremists have no idea what the hell they’re talking about.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:23)', 'Speech': 'No, I’m serious. They’re pushing a notion the defeated former president expressed when he was in office and believes applies only to him. And this is a dangerous notion. This president is above the law, with no limits on power. Trump says the Constitution gave him, “The right to do whatever he wants as president.” I’ve never even heard a president say that in jest. Not guided by the Constitution or by common service and decency toward our fellow Americans but by vengeance and vindictiveness.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:06)', 'Speech': 'We see the headlines, “Sweeping expansion of presidential power.” Their goal to, “Alter the balance of power by increasing the president’s authority over every part of the federal government.” What do they intend to do once they erode the constitutional order of checks and balances and separation of powers? Limit the independence of federal agencies and put them under the thumb of a president? Give the president the power to refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated, if he doesn’t like what it’s being spent for? Not veto, he doesn’t like what it’s being spent for, it’s there. Get rid of longstanding protections for Civil Service?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:53)', 'Speech': 'Remember what he did as he was leaving office, He imposed a new thing, the Civil Service. But then he imposed a new schedule. Schedule F, it was called. These civil servants had to pledge loyalty to the president, not the Constitution. It did not require that they had any protections, and the president would be able to wholesale fire them if he wanted, because they had no Civil Service protection. One of the first things I got rid of when I became president.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:27)', 'Speech': 'Just consider these as actual quotes from the MAGA movement. “I am your retribution.” “Slitting throats” of civil servants, replacing them with extreme political cronies. MAGA extremists proclaim support for law enforcement only to say, “We must destroy the FBI.” It’s not one person. It’s the controlling element of the House Republican Party. Whitewash attacks of January 6th by calling the spearing and stomping of police a “legitimate political discourse.” Did you ever think you’d hear leaders of political parties in the United States of America speak like that? Seizing power, concentrating power, attempting to abuse power, purging and packing key institutions, spewing conspiracy theories, spreading lies for profit and power to divide America in every way, inciting violence against those who risk their lives to keep America safe, weaponizing against the very soul of who we are as Americans.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:46)', 'Speech': 'This MAGA threat is the threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions. But it’s also a threat to the character of our nation that gives our Constitution life, that binds us together as Americans in common cause. None of this is surprising, though. They’ve tried to govern that way before. And thank God, they failed. But they haven’t given up. Just look at recent days. Their accusations of treason against the major news network because they don’t like its coverage. I don’t know what the hell I’d say about Fox if that becomes the rule. But think about it. I’m joking, but think about it. Tomorrow, I have the honor of overseeing the change of responsibilities of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Military, from one genuine hero and patriot, General Mark Milley, to another, General CQ Brown, both defining leaders of our time. And yet, here is what you hear from MAGA extremists about the retiring patriot general honoring his oath to the Constitution, “He’s a traitor.” “In times gone by, the punishment would’ve been death.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:16)', 'Speech': 'This is the United States of America. This is the United States of America. And although I don’t believe even a majority of Republicans think that, the silence is deafening. The silence is deafening. Hardly any Republican called out such heinous statements, just as they watch one MAGA senator outrageously instead, blocking the promotions of hundreds of top military leaders and affecting not only those leaders but their families, their children.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:55)', 'Speech': 'MAGA extremists claim support of our troops, but they are harming military readiness, leadership, troop morale, freezing pay, freezing military families in limbo. Just as they looked the other way when the defeated former president refused to pay respects at an American cemetery near Paris, referring to the American servicemen buried there, and I’ve been to this cemetery, as “suckers” and “losers.” I’m not making this up. I know we all tried not to remember it, but that’s what he said. He called servicemen “suckers” and “losers.”.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:41)', 'Speech': 'Was John a sucker? Was my son, Beau, who lived next to a burn pit for a year, came home, and died, was he a sucker for volunteering to serve his country? The same guy who denigrates the heroism of John McCain. It’s not only wrong, it’s un-American. But it never changes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:02)', 'Speech': 'The MAGA extremists across the country have made it clear where they stand. So, the challenge for the rest of America, for the majority of Americans is to make clear where we stand. Do we still believe in the Constitution? Do we believe in the basic decency and respect? The whole country should honestly ask itself, and I mean this sincerely, what it wants and understand the threats to our democracy. I believe very strongly the defining feature of our democracy is our Constitution. I believe in the separation of powers and checks and balances, that debate and disagreement do not lead to disunion. I believe in free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. I believe there is no place in America, none, none, none, for political violence. We have to denounce hate, not embolden it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:45)', 'Speech': 'I’ve tried my very best, and I’m sure I haven’t met the test all of you want me to meet, but I’ve tried my very best to meet the highest standards, whether you voted for me or not, because that’s the job, to deliver light, not heat, to make sure democracy delivers for everyone. To know we’re a nation of unlimited possibilities, of wisdom and decency. A nation focused on the future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:16)', 'Speech': 'I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has. 68 hours alone with just he and I and an interpreter. Traveled 17,000 miles with him, here and in China. On the Tibetan plateau, he turned to me and he asked me, he said, ” Can you define America for me?” And I was deadly earnest. I said, “Yes, in one word, possibilities.” We in America believe anything’s possible if we try it. Anything we do together, we can get done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:45)', 'Speech': 'We faced some tough times in recent years, and I’m proud of the progress we made as a country. But the real credit doesn’t go to me and my administration for this progress, the real heroes of the story are you, the American people. And that’s not hyperbole, again, which is why I’m asking you that regardless of whether you’re a Democrat, Republican or Independent, put the preservation of our democracy before everything else. Put our country first. Over the past few years, we can and should be a proud American democracy, proud of what we’ve been able to hold onto.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:21)', 'Speech': 'We can’t take democracy for granted. Remember, when you’re in high school and college, if you took political science, it said, every generation has to protect democracy. I used to think that that was just a saying. But here I am, as President of the United States of America, making this speech about my fear of the diminishment of democracy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:45)', 'Speech': 'Folks, every generation has to be vigilant. Toward the end of my Senate campaign, I convinced Strom Thurmond to vote for the civil rights legislation. Not a joke. I thought, “Well, you can defeat hate.” You can’t defeat it. Just bury it. When someone comes along and lifts up the rock and breathes a little oxygen in there, it comes roaring back. It comes roaring back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:17)', 'Speech': 'We should all remember, democracies don’t have to die at the end of a rifle. They can die when people are silent, when they fail to stand up or condemn the threats to democracy, when people are willing to give away that which is most precious to them because they feel frustrated, disillusioned, tired, alienated. I get it. I really do. I get it. For all its faults, though, American democracy remains the best path forward to prosperity, possibilities, progress, fair play, equality, and democracy requires all of us and all the major parties.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:59)', 'Speech': 'You matter. And again, I’m not just trying to be nice here, you matter, all of you in this auditorium, because history and common sense tell us that we can change things by adhering to our constitution and our institution’s democracy. Our task, our sacred task of our time, is to make sure that they change not for the worse, but for the better. That democracy survives and thrives, not be smashed by a movement or interest in a power, in a principle. It’s up to us, the American people. In my view, the more people vote, the more engaged the whole nation becomes, the stronger democracy will be.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:43)', 'Speech': 'So the answer to the threats we face is engagement. It’s not to sit in the sidelines, it’s to build coalitions and community to remind ourselves there’s a clear majority of us who believe in our democracy and are ready to protect it. To the students here today, young people across the country, you’re the reason I’m so optimistic. I know I don’t look it, but I’ve been doing this for a long time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:14)', 'Speech': 'But all kidding aside, I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s chances in domestic and foreign policies than today. I really mean it because the young people, a hundred thousand students at this university and all across America, they are the most gifted, the most tolerant, the most talented, and the best educated generation in American history. And it’s your generation, more than anyone else’s, who will answer the questions, the legitimate questions the young man asked me a moment ago, I’m going to meet with. Questions from America. Who are we? What do we stand for? What do we believe? Who will we be?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:56)', 'Speech': 'It’s not your burden alone, but your generation will not be ignored, will not be shunned, will not be silent. I’ve said it before, we’re at an inflection point in our history. One of those moments that not only happens once every several generations, it happens once every eight or nine generations where the decisions made in the short period of time we’re in now are going to determine the course of this country and the world for the next six or seven decades.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:26)', 'Speech': 'So you, me, every American who’s committed to preserving our democracy and our constitutional protections, we carry a special responsibility. We have to stand up for American values embedded in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, because we know that MAGA extremists have already proven they won’t. Madeline Albright wrote a book, the former Secretary of State, saying, “We’re the essential nation.” We are. And I think you’ve sensed that abroad, Cindy, haven’t you?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:58)', 'Speech': 'Any room I walk in, and no matter what heads of state I’m with, everything stops. Not because of Joe Biden, but because I’m President of the United States of America. We are the essential nation. We are the essential nation, the rest of the world’s looking. So we have to stand up for our constitution and institutions of democracy because MAGA extremists have made it clear they’re not going to. History’s watching. The world is watching. And, most important, our children and grandchildren will hold us responsible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:36)', 'Speech': 'So let me close to this. In three years, we’ll commemorate the 250th anniversary, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. A moment not only about our past, celebrating all we’ve done, but a moment about the future. But all we can be, still be, imagine that moment and ask, “What do we want to be?” Now’s our time to continue to choose and secure a sacred cause of the American democracy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:06)', 'Speech': 'I know we can meet this moment. John knew we could meet this moment. He believed, as so many patriots before him did, that the character, destiny in our own lives and the life of this nation, he believed in us. That’s what we see in the McCain Institute and Library and every day places across America doing extraordinary things. And remember that the soul of America depends on the souls of all Americans. How we choose to see our nation, how we choose to see ourselves, how we choose to lead, not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:50)', 'Speech': 'So let’s never quit. Let’s never hide from history. Let’s make history. If we do that, we’ll have done our duty to our country and to each other. Future generations will say, “We kept the faith.” We’ll have proved, through all its imperfections, America’s still a place of possibilities, a beacon for the world, a promise realized where the power forever resides with we, the people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:17)', 'Speech': 'That’s our soul. That’s who we truly are. That’s who must always be. And that’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all. May God bless John McCain, his family, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.'}]"

In my own disability advocacy, I have realized that these historic pieces of legislation were vital steps towards fairness. But the push towards equity continues. Our laws and policies must reflect that our disabled lives are not of lesser value. In partnership with the disability community, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to do just that. Breaking down barriers that exist today in transportation, healthcare, education, employment, voting and more. It is an honor to introduce a friend to the disability community, and a president who knows that every American deserves a life of dignity and respect, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:48)', 'Speech': 'Scout, release. Scout, release, side.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:12)', 'Speech': 'My name’s Joe Biden, I’m Jill Biden’s husband. What I told this beautiful lady when we met inside, she’s doing so much to change people’s lives. All of you are. I look out there and I see one of the guys that got it started, Tom Harkin. Tom, stand up. Stand up for people to see you. Good to see you, Tom. Elizabeth Dole, Bob Dole was a major, major player in all of this. He really was. I remember getting in trouble because someone was criticizing Bob Dole on the floor for why do we need curb cuts? Why do we need all those kinds of things? I got myself in trouble. Anyway, he was great. There’s so, so, so many really important people here that made all this possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:16)', 'Speech': 'Tammy Duckworth, she’s too young. Steny Hoyer. Steny. Madeline Dean, Jared Huffman. I think they’re supposed to be here. Mark Pocan. And Mark, you here? Well, I guess what… Mary Kay Scanlon. I keep telling them I think we’re related. I found out when I went to Ireland, they did my genealogy and they think I got a Scanlon in the background, so I may be your 19th cousin. Jan Schakowsky. Jan, good to see you. Dina Titus. By the way, is Tim Shriver here? Tim, thank you, pal. You’ve been there the whole time at the Special Olympics. It’s incredible what you’ve done. I’m not going to read all the organizations because you’ll get sunstroke by the time I get finished doing that. But look, I want to welcome all to the White House. Selma, thank you for the introduction. But more importantly, thank you for your advocacy. Your advocacy has given people hope, you’ve changed people’s lives, along with the rest of you who are here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:45)', 'Speech': 'Kamala and Doug are here. I want to thank them for being here. They’re strong, strong, strong supporters as well. I want to thank you, Kamala, for your leadership. We’re joined by many members of Congress, as I said, including some of the biggest champions of this disability rights community. I think I’ve gone through most of the names already. But here’s the deal. A big thanks to the courageous activists here who work so hard to make the country more accessible and more just. One of my first acts as a United States Senator, I know I don’t look old enough to do it, but one of my first acts was I was a co-sponsor of the Rehabilitation Act. The first time in the nation’s history, we declared in law what we knew to be true, that an American with disability deserved dignity, respect, an equal chance at the American Dream.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:43)', 'Speech': 'The Rehabilitation Act is one of the most consequential civil rights laws in our nation’s history, banning discrimination on the basis of disability, by any entity funded by the federal government. It promoted equal access to our communities, authorized independent living services, and research that supports disabled people in living their lives that they want to lead. Folks. But after the Rehabilitation Act was signed in the law, its implementation was delayed. In response, disability advocates staged sit-ins named for the section of the law that the government had failed to implement. One of those was, as you’ve already mentioned, Judy Heumann, who we lost earlier this year. We’re joined today by so many of Judy’s family and friends. Would her family stand up? Any of Judy’s family? Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:47)', 'Speech': 'As an infant, you all know Judy contracted polio and lost the ability to walk. At the age of five, she was prohibited from entering kindergarten because her principal deemed her wheelchair a fire hazard. A fire hazard. Judy turned that pain of this rejection, and then many more that followed, into purpose. After the Rehabilitation Act passed, she led demonstrations in San Francisco, testified in congressional hearings, demanding that the people in power actually implement the law that was passed. After four years of protest, Judy and disabled activists all over the country were successful. History shows it’s often not the people in power, but the power of the people, that moves the nation forward. All of you did. The Rehabilitation Act laid the groundwork for another landmark law celebrated today, the Americans with Disabilities Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:51)', 'Speech': 'Steny Hoyer led the charge in the house along with Major Robert Owens, Tony Coelho, as well as Tom Harkin and Bob Dole. They led the fight in the Senate. I was enormously proud to be a Senate cosponsor. Today, three decades after it’s passage, many of us can still recall the America where a person with disability could be denied service in a restaurant or a grocery store. Where an employer could refuse to hire because of a disability. When we passed this law, we made a commitment to build an America for all Americans. For all Americans. Perhaps most importantly, we did it together. This was a bipartisan bill, signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush 33 years ago on this spot on the south lawn of the White House. It marked progress that wasn’t political but personal for millions of disabled American veterans and families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:03)', 'Speech': 'Folks, for more than 61 million Americans living with a disability, these laws are a source of opportunity, meaningful inclusion, participation, respect, and as my dad would say, the most important of all, dignity, being treated with dignity. Ensuring the American Dream is for all of us, not just for some of us. A [inaudible 00:10:27] against discrimination and a path to personal independence. For our nation, these laws are a testament to our character as a people, a triumph of values over selfishness. But of course, these laws didn’t bring an end to the work we need to do. Disabled Americans are still three times less likely to have a job, and they often earn less for the exact work someone else is doing is not disabled. Too often, disabled Americans are unable to vote, to get to and from work and school, to enjoy public spaces. But thanks to all of you, we’re continuing to make progress.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:06)', 'Speech': 'In my first few months in office, I was around to sign an executive order, proud to do it, establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equality and equity in federal employment, including for people with disabilities. It brought together the Department of Labor and the Office of Personal Management to ensure that we’re making federal workplaces all over fully accessible to people with disabilities. So, the dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted in every policy we pursue. The whole purpose of engaging my labor department is to help protect workers with disabilities and fight to end to unjust employment practices. We are also helping state and local governments, businesses and nonprofits, access federal funds to hire more disabled Americans. We continue to make sure this administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions all across our government.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:13)', 'Speech': 'Over my first two years, in my administration, we’ve seen a 22% increase in people with disabilities employed by the federal government. We’re going to continue to grow it. We’re making the federal government a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, opportunities to advance for people with disabilities. We’re also taking action to improve access to healthcare for disabled Americans. Today, as many of you unfortunately know, some doctors and hospitals are denying medical treatments related to organ donations or lifesaving care for disabled Americans based on their disability alone. That’s why the Department of Health and Human Services just proposed the rule barring these kinds of denials from medical treatment because no American, no American, should be deprived of healthcare they need, period. It’s simple. No American. The Department of Health and Human Services also launched long COVID clinical trials and created the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice for the first of its kind initiative in our history. And because of your advocacy, the National Institutes of Health just designated people with disabilities, a health disparity population.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:37)', 'Speech': 'You all know what that means, but I’m going to try to briefly explain that to people listening, which opens up new funding for research into unmet health needs specific to disabled Americans. We also launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in biomedicine to prevent, detect, and treat diseases including cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and other neurological diseases like MS.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:59)', 'Speech': 'The American Rescue Plan provided billions of dollars to all 50 states to expand home and community-based services under Medicaid. So again, in my experience, with friends who are disabled, it also just continues to provide the dignity They’re looking for. Just dignity. More people with disabilities, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, can live independently at home. The Inflation Reduction Act, cap the cost of in insulin $35 a month and out-of-pocket prescription drug costs are going to be limited to $2,000 a year for older Americans, no matter what the disability, no matter how expensive, no matter what drugs they use. Even if you’re using cancer drugs that are $10,000, $12,000, $14,000, no more than $2,000 a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:59)', 'Speech': 'Our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the biggest investment ever, $1.75 billion to make transit and rail stations more accessible. We’re modernizing airports by adding wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms and so much more. The Department of Transportation issued a rule that now requires all new single aisle aircraft over a certain size to have wheelchair accessible restrooms. The Department of Justice proposed standards for state and local governments to make their internet content and mobile apps more accessible to disabled Americans, so they can easily do things like travel to and from work and school, care for themselves and their loved ones, and vote.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:48)', 'Speech': 'Look, accessibility is the cornerstone of ensuring government works for everybody. Accessibility. So let me close with this Judy Heumann, in reflecting on her life, wrote, and I quote, “Change never happens at a pace we think it should. It happens over years of people joining together, strategizing, sharing, and pulling all the leavers they possibly can.” Well, that’s a story we’re celebrating here today. Progress hard fought and won, making real our nation’s founding promise that every American, every American, has a right to be recognized and respected for who they are. Millions of Americans with a disability, this is a source of identity and power. This is the essence of the disability pride. Look folks, it’s the essence of what Judy and so many of you here today have fought so hard for, and the progress we’ll continue to make together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:45)', 'Speech': 'Folks, as I look out on all of you, I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Never. We just have to remember who in hell we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity, if we set our mind to do it and we work together. Folks, there’s so much more, because it’s so hot out here, I don’t want to keep you. But folks, the fundamental research going on for all the various disabilities is staggering. It’s staggering.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:28)', 'Speech': 'For example, whether it’s we’re spending billions of dollars on research and development for health disparities, everything from… Anyway. But it’s because of you all not only had the physical courage to deal with whatever your disability is, those of you who are in this community, but you stood up, you spoke for everybody else. You spoke not just for yourself, but for everybody. You’ve changed people’s lives for the better. You’ve given people hope, you’ve allowed them to regain their pride, their dignity, and be able to do what they want to do as best they can. So I think this is just the beginning. I think someone’s going to be standing here 20 years from now talking about how fundamentally it’s changed across the board. We can never stop. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"
https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-an-update-on-efforts-to-cancel-student-debt-transcript,2023-10-05,President Biden Delivers an Update on Efforts to Cancel Student Debt Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:26)', 'Speech': 'I know we have strong disagreements, but we need to stop seeing each other as enemies. We need to talk to one another, listen to one another, work with one another, and we can do that. I joined with Minority Leader Jeffries in saying that our Republican colleagues remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion. We were prepared to do it as well, for the good of the American people. Twice in the last six months, both Houses came together on bipartisan basis, once to avoid default, once to keep the government open. And, while we should never have been in a situation in the first place, I’m grateful that leaders on both sides came together, including former Speaker McCarthy, to do the right thing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:10)', 'Speech': 'Now, turning to student debt relief. When I ran for President, I vowed to fix our broken student loan program because, while college degree is still the ticket to a better life, that ticket has become excessively expensive. Americans who are saddled with unsustainable debt, in exchange for a college degree, has become the norm. Since my administration has taken significant action to provide student debt relief to as many borrowers possible as quickly as possible. That starts with making sure the existing system works and the way it was supposed to work for student borrowers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:47)', 'Speech': 'We fixed what was called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which was designed originally to make sure school teachers, firefighters, social workers, and other public servants can get their student loans forgiven if they make 10 years of payments and do 10 years of public service. By the time I took office, that program had been in place for nearly 15 years, but because of red tape, only 7,000 borrowers had been helped. Today, thanks to the reforms, more than 700,000 borrowers have had their debts forgiven.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:23)', 'Speech': 'Just the other day, I spoke with Tanya and Chad, a married couple in their fifties who both work at public high school in Milwaukee. For years, they paid over $800 a month toward their student loans. It meant they couldn’t put away any money for retirement and, this summer, thanks to fixes we made to the debt relief program, for people in public service, Chad and Tanya’s remaining balance was forgiven. Tanya said, “the amount of relief this gives us as indescribable.” Now, they can finally start savings for retirement.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:57)', 'Speech': 'Next, we fixed what’s called the Income Driven Repayment program. Here’s how that works. If you have an undergraduate loan, after 20 years of straight paying, not missing paying and debt on a monthly basis, whatever’s left to your loan is forgiven after 20 years. But because of administrative failures, some people who did pay their loans, for 20 years or more, did not get the debt relief they’d earned. We fixed that and made sure borrowers got credit for every single payment they made.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:29)', 'Speech': 'As a result of these changes, today, I’m announcing my administration has approved an additional $9 billion in relief for 125,000 borrowers in just the past few weeks under that program. With the latest debt cancellation, in total, my administration has canceled $127 billion in student debts for nearly 3.6 million Americans. This kind of relief is life-changing for individuals and their families, but it’s good for our economy as a whole as well. By freeing millions of Americans from the crushing burden of student debt, it means they can go and get their lives in order. They can think about buying a house, they can start a business, they can be starting a family. This matters. It matters with their daily lives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:13)', 'Speech': 'This latest progress builds on other steps we’ve taken. We made the largest increase in Pell Grants in over a decade, helping students and families making less than $60,000 a year get to college. We made additional improvements in the income driven repayment program. Before I took office, student borrowers would pay no more than 10% of their discretionary income on a monthly basis, if they wanted to do it that way. But, under my administration’s plan, which is called Save Plan, we reduced that to 5% for undergraduate borrowers. It’s now the most generous repayment program ever. Under this plan, no one with an undergraduate loan, today or in the future, whether they’re at a community college or a four-year college, will have to pay more than 5% of their discretionary income to repay these loans. That’s income after you pay for necessity, like housing, food, and other necessities. You can sign up for the Save Plan at studentaid.gov/save. Studentaid.gov/save. And, remember, if you keep up your payments after 20 years, whatever’s left in those loans is forgiven, and we’re still not done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:33)', 'Speech': 'As you might remember, last year, I announced a major proposal for student debt relief we’re on the verge providing more than 40 million Americans with real relief from their student debt. The money was literally about to go out the door, but Republicans and Republican elected officials and special interests stepped up and sued us. The Supreme Court sided with them snatching, from the hands of millions of Americans, thousands of dollars in debt and student debt relief that was about to change their lives. As I said at the time, I believe the court’s decision to strike down my student debt relief program was wrong, but I promised I wouldn’t give up.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:10)', 'Speech': 'Since then, my administration has been pursuing a new approach, grounded and under a different law. The Higher Education Act. This act allows a Secretary of Education to compromise, waive or release loans under certain circumstances. Last week, the Department of Education took a critical step in this process by identifying specific challenges that borrowers face in the current system, so we can move forward with a new rule to address these changes. For example, there are many borrowers who have made payments for many years, but because of interest, they still owe more than they originally borrowed. My administration is doing everything it can to deliver student debt relief to as many as we can as fast as we can.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:54)', 'Speech': 'This is in contrast to House Republicans who helped block the previous debt relief plan, nearly shut down the government over the extreme demands, which would’ve hurt hardworking families. But they had no problem with the paycheck protection program. Remember that? The PPP program during the last several years, which was designed to help business owners who lost money, which was legitimate, because of the pandemic. Members of Congress got over hundreds of thousands of dollars because their businesses lost money. It was a worthy program.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:31)', 'Speech': 'Let’s be clear, some of the same elected Republicans or members of Congress were strongly opposed, getting relief to students, got hundreds of thousands of dollars relief for themselves to keep their businesses open. Several members of Congress got over a million dollars and all those loans were forgiven. The hypocrisy of this I find stunning. I supported that program and I support the Student Debt Program. My administration will continue to use every tool at our disposal, to help ease the burden of student debt, so more Americans can be free to achieve their dreams. It’s good for our economy, it’s good for our country, and it’s going to change their lives. Thank you very much.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:29)', 'Speech': 'And so, I think that it’s clear to the vast majority of the foreign policy community, on both left and right, that this has been a valuable exercise for the United States of America to increase the support we have around the world. What I don’t want to do is… We put together over 50 nations, 50 nations supporting Ukraine, and we are the organizer of that. I’ve met with… Don’t hold me to the exact number, 16 or 17 yesterday, in a long conversation and made the case that I knew that the majority of the American people still supported Ukraine and the majority of the members of the Congress, both Democrat and Republican, support it. I don’t think we should let the gamesmanship get in the way of blocking it,'}]"

When I got up this morning and started this at 7:30, 8 o’clock, [inaudible 00:00:41]. Hamas terrorists crossing in Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers, but Israeli civilians in the street, in their homes. Innocent people murdered, wounded. Entire families taken hostage by Hamas just days after Israel marked the holiest of days in the Jewish calendar is unconscionable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:02)', 'Speech': 'When I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning, I told him the United States stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never a justification for terrorist attacks, and my administration of support for Israel’s security is rock-solid and unwavering.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:24)', 'Speech': 'Let me say this as clearly as I can. This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks, to seek advantage. The world is watching. I’ve also been in contact with the King of Jordan, spoken with members of Congress, directed my national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts, military to military, intelligence to intelligence, diplomat to diplomat, to make sure Israel has what it needs. I’ve also directed my team to remain in constant contact with leaders throughout the region, including Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, the UAE, as well as our European partners and the Palestinian Authority.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:08)', 'Speech': 'It’s also a terrible strategy on a human level. It’s hurting innocent people. Seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart, it’s heartbreaking, and Jill and I are praying for those families who’ve been impacted by this violence. We grieve with those who’ve lost their loved ones, lost a piece of their soul. We have hope for swift recovery for many who have been wounded.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:34)', 'Speech': 'But I personally am going to remain in close contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu as this situation continues to develop, and let there be no mistake: the United States stands with the State of Israel, just as we have from the moment the United States became the first nation to recognize Israel 11 minutes after its founding 75 years ago.

There’s still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones, not knowing if they’re alive, or dead, or hostages. Infants in their mothers’ arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage, hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality. It’s abhorrent. The brutality of Hamas, this blood thirstiness brings to mind the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism, but sadly for the Jewish people, it’s not new. This attack has brought to the surface painful memories and the scars left by a millennia of antisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:55)', 'Speech': 'So in this moment, we must be crystal clear, we stand with Israel. We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack. There’s no justification for terrorism. There’s no excuse. Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purposes is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people. They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:47)', 'Speech': 'The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking. Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond to these vicious attacks. I just got off the phone with a third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu and I told him, if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive, and overwhelming. We also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. Terrorists purposely target civilians, kill them. We uphold the laws of war, the law of war. It matters. There’s a difference.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:39)', 'Speech': 'Today, Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart. A lot of us know how it feels. It leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family, feeling like you’re being sucked in, the anger, the pain, the sense of hopelessness. This is what they mean by a human tragedy, an atrocity on an appalling scale. We’re going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel, who are suffering unspeakable losses, and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:26)', 'Speech': 'My team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this crisis began. We’re surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome. We’re going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens. My administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis, and when Congress returns, we’re going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners. This is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:18)', 'Speech': 'We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas. I’ve directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States Government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts because, as President, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world. The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence, and we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:08)', 'Speech': 'Let me say again, to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word, don’t. Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear.

This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:46)', 'Speech': 'We’re also taking steps at home in cities across the United States of America. Police departments have stepped up security around centers of Jewish life. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks. This is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning. Let’s be real clear, there is no place for hate in America, not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. What we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil, just as we’ve always done. That’s what America stands for.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:44)', 'Speech': 'Just over 50 years ago, I was thinking about it this morning, talking to the Secretary of State, the Vice President in my office, over 50 years ago as a young senator, I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected senator, and I had a long, long trip, meeting with Golda Meir in her office just before the Yom Kippur war. And I guess she could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced, they were facing. We walked outside in that hallway outside her office to have some photo. She looked at me all of a sudden and said, “Would you like to have a photograph?” And so I got up and followed her out. We’re standing there silent, looking at the press. She could tell, I guess, I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me, she said, “Don’t worry, Senator Biden, we have a secret weapon here in Israel.” My word, this is what she said, “We have no place else to go. We have no place else to go.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:03)', 'Speech': 'For 75 years, Israel has stood as the ultimate guarantor of the security of Jewish people around the world so that the atrocities of the past could never happen again.

It was a terrorist assault. There is never any justification for terrorism. There are no two sides to this issue. The images that we saw will be seared in our brains forever. Rockets falling on cities. People dragged from their homes and shot dead children, sheltering from bullets, bodies aligning the streets. And all the while we see videos of these terrorists cheering on these atrocities.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:41)', 'Speech': 'The toll on Israel and the Jewish community is hard to imagine, but we can’t imagine it because it’s happening. And I know many of you have sent texts and calls this weekend checking on loved ones. I know too many of you received heartbreaking replies. We know today that at least 22 Americans won’t be coming home. I know you’re all hurting. The entire Jewish community is hurting. I’m hurting. And we grieve with you. We stand with you. But thank God we have the steady leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during this unthinkable time in our history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:22)', 'Speech': 'Their moral compass, their calm, their empathy our what we need in this time of crisis. We saw that yesterday when President Biden with Vice President Harris and Secretary Blinken by his side powerfully addressed the nation and made clear to the world that Israel has the United States unwavering support. Our president and vice president are making sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:53)', 'Speech': 'We are grateful for their leadership and support for Israel at this exceptionally difficult time. We also acknowledge and address how these events will impact us as Jews and why we’re here to have this discussion. I know many of us feel a deep fear that these attacks will unfortunately and already have led to a rise in hate and antisemitism. We’re already seeing it. And that’s why this discussion and the work you and your organizations do is so vitally important.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:27)', 'Speech': 'Almost a year ago, I sat right in this spot, in this very room, and many of you were here with me that day. And then we called attention to the epidemic of hate that we’re facing. And following that meeting, we took action. And in May, the Biden-Harris administration released the first ever national strategy to counter antisemitism. The plan includes over 100 meaningful actions we are taking right now to fight back against antisemitism and hate.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:02)', 'Speech': 'Each of you played a role in crafting this strategy. We couldn’t have done this without you. So thank you for the work that you’ve done that you’re continuing to do. And as we’re going to discuss later, myself and the Biden Harris administration officials are working with federal, state, and local leaders to implement this plan across the country. We are going to continue to bring people together, and importantly, we’re going to build coalitions to fight back against hate.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:30)', 'Speech': 'We cannot do this alone. The story of the Jewish people has always been one of perseverance and resilience. In dark times, we come together and we fight back. We also seek to build a better world. Last year, before my trip to Poland and Germany, President Biden took me into the Oval Office. He told me how his father had taught him about the horrors of the Holocaust and how he later traveled to Dachau with his children and grandchildren to teach them those same lessons.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:04)', 'Speech': 'So I know firsthand how important it is to President Biden to preserve our Jewish history and to make sure that hate has no safe harbor in America and the world.

It’s now my honor to introduce a true advocate for the Jewish community. Please join me in welcoming President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:33)', 'Speech': 'I apologize.

When terrorist grew like Hamas brought not only terror but sheer evil, sheer evil to the world. Evil that echoes the worst and matches in some cases exceeds the worst atrocities of ISIS.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:44)', 'Speech': 'More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered in Israel. By the way, I’ve been speaking with a number of Israeli leaders, a number of leaders around the world, leaders in the region as well. Among those who have been victimized this evil who’ve been killed are at least 22 American citizens. This attack was a campaign of pure cruelty. Not just hate, but pure cruelty against the Jewish people. I would argue it’s the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, the deadliest days since the Holocaust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:31)', 'Speech': 'One of the worst chapters in human history that remind us all that expression I learned from my dad early on, silence is complicity. I mean, silence is complicity. It really is. I want you to know, I think you’ve already figured it out. I refuse to be silent. And I know you refuse to be silent as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:54)', 'Speech': 'I know you’re here with my senior staff. You all represent a voice that America has to hear. America can’t be silent. We not only reject terrorism, but it goes beyond that. It goes beyond rejecting terrorism. I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu for I don’t know how many times, but again, this morning and already we’re surging additional military assistance to the Israeli defense force, including ammunition, interceptors replenish the iron dome and we moved the US carrier fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean and we’re sending more fighter jets there in that region and made it clear, made it clear to the Iranians, be careful.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:53)', 'Speech': 'We want to make it real clear we’re working on every aspect of the hostage crisis in Israel including deploying experts to advise and assist with recovery efforts. Now, the press is going to shout to me, and many of you are that, “What are you doing to get these folks home?” If I told you I wouldn’t be able to get them home, folks, there’s a lot we’re doing, a lot we’re doing. I have not given up hope of bringing these folks home, but the idea that I’m going to stand here before you and tell you what I’m doing is bizarre.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:27)', 'Speech': 'So I hope you understand how bizarre I think it would be to try to answer that question. In the days ahead. We’re going to continue to work closely with our partners in Israel and around the world to ensure Israel has what is needs to defend its citizens and cities and to respond to these attacks. As I said yesterday, “My commitment to Israel’s security and the safety of Jewish people is unshakable.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:49)', 'Speech': 'The United States has Israel’s back, and I have yours as well, both at home and abroad. You can see the pain in some of your faces. I walked into this room. You okay kiddo? Well, your fear for family, friends back in Israel, you worry about kids being targeted in school, about going about their daily lives. Are you hurt by the downplaying of Hamas atrocities and blaming Israel?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:19)', 'Speech': 'This is unconscionable. I’ve asked members of my team, including Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland to work intensively with our Jewish community partners. So many of you here to set up security around Jewish life in America, identify, prevent and disrupt emerging threats that occur. We’re also going to continue to condemn and combat antisemitism at every single turn, at every turn.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:45)', 'Speech': 'The past few days have been a solemn reminder that hate never goes away. Hold on a second. I used to think you could defeat hate that you could make it. All it does is go underground. Just goes underground. It doesn’t go away. It only hides until it’s given a little oxygen, a little bit of oxygen. And that’s why I’ve secured the largest ever increase in funding for physical security for nonprofits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish day schools. And it may release the first ever national strategy to counter antisemitism with the input from many of you in this room.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:24)', 'Speech': 'Many of you in this room help write that. It’s the most ambitious, comprehensive effort to combat antisemitism in American history, in all of American history. We’re aggressively implementing, but we must all do our part and forcefully speak out against antisemitism and push back against the attempts to deny or distort the facts to make clear there is no place for hate in America, not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. We mourn the act and so many leaders have across the country showing us what thousands of years of Jewish history has shown us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:05)', 'Speech': 'The enduring strength. And I mean this sincerely, the enduring sense in spirit of Jewish community. If you excuse a point of personal privilege, you should say in the Senate. That’s why I took my kids. Everyone when they turned 14 years old, one at a time, put them on a plane and took them to Dachau. I wanted them to see that you could not know what was going on walking through those gates. You could not fail to understand as a country what was going on. And that’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:39)', 'Speech': 'It had a profound impact on my children and my grandchildren. Some thought taking a 14-year-old grandchild, is that a mistake? I took them one at a time. I got three more to go. And folks, it’s important. The miracle of Israel is Israel. It’s Israel itself. The hope it inspires, the light it represents of the world. Folks, I was asked, in one of my very frank conversations with Bibi and Herzog. I said, “Why do I feel so deeply about this?” It’s not about the region. I truly believe where there’s no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It’s the only ultimate guarantee, the only ultimate guarantee, the only ultimate guarantee.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:43)', 'Speech': 'And folks, because of you, and I mean it sincerely because you’re speaking up because of the intensity and the intellect and the brilliance you bring to this cause, I think we have a chance to end this in a way that it makes it very difficult for it to be repeated. I want to thank you for your leadership. And as I said, there’s a lot to talk about, but I’m really quite frankly concerned as to… It’s hard to talk about this without detail and it’s contrary to our interests to let out the detail of what were going on. I mean, this is just round the clock as you understand. You fully understand.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:36)', 'Speech': 'But I’ve known Bibi for over 40 years and very frank relationship. I know him well. And the one thing that I did say that it is really important that Israel, all the anger, frustration, and just… I don’t know how to explain it that exists is that they operate by the rules of war. The rules of war. And there are rules of war.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:21)', 'Speech': 'I believe Israel is doing everything is power to pull the country together, stay on the same page, and we’re going to do everything in our power to make sure here’s a succeed in God willing to bring home those Americans who are in harm’s way. I’m going to let you all have the private conversation you’ve been having, which you should continue to have. But it just came to basically, I really mean it from the bottom of my heart. I give you my word as a Biden. Thank you. Thank you for the intensity of your support. It matters. It matters that Americans see what’s happening.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:04)', 'Speech': 'I mean, I’ve been doing this a long time. I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children. I never thought I’d ever… Anyway. But there are countries in the region that are trying to be of some help, including Arab nations trying to be of some help. So anyway…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:28)', 'Speech': 'Look, I don’t know anything about the kind of loss he’s talking about, but I know a little bit like to feel loss, lose people you adore, get a phone call saying they’re gone. I get that part. Not the same, but I get the part. And what I’ve learned is that as we persevere, we can grow. And the day will come when the memory of that person or those persons bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It will happen. It will happen. But God, it takes a long time sometimes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:15)', 'Speech': 'And when it’s born out of something that has been anything from a mistake to a vicious, vicious attempt, it varies in the grief. I’m not saying I know the same, but I just… Look, I mean, I’ll never forget… Well, I won’t go into that. Anyway, I just think that if we stay true to our values, pursue with every inch and every bit of our energy to get this right, we can bury this again and bring people back, and bring people home, and bring it together. I think we can change the Middle East. But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:10)', 'Speech': 'I’m not going to answer any questions from you guys right now, but my team here knows when the press is gone, they’ll talk more directly to you.

We work hard for our money, and instead of getting to enjoy it, we have to be on alert for companies looking to take every nickel and dime they can. The president is taking this seriously and fighting hard for working families like mine. No one should have to figure out how to cover costs that were not transparent upfront and ended up being beyond what they budgeted for. For that Mr. President, we say thank you, truly thank you. And with that, it is my great honor and privilege to introduce to you the man who has made tackling junk fees a priority for all Americans. Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:49)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, Becky, for that introduction and for sharing your story that’s familiar to so many families. This gets down to a basic problem, a basic circumstance, it’s just about fairness, just about simple fairness. Folks are tired of being taken advantage of and being played for suckers, that’s why I’m here with the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra. Where are you, Rohit? There you are. Stand up, let people see who you are. And the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan. Lina, stand up. They’re members of the Competition Council that I created to promote competition across the economy and lower cost for families. And I am not going to introduce everybody, but we wouldn’t be getting anywhere without the incredible support of the members of Congress that are here today. And we may have to go back and actually change the law, change the circumstances, and so I’m counting on you. Anyway, would all the members of Congress stand up so everybody can see you?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:58)', 'Speech': 'In any fight I’m in, that’s the team I want on my side. Look, one of the key things I’ve asked the council to tackle are the unfair fees known as junk fees. Those hidden charges that companies sneak into your bill to make you pay more because they can, just simply because they can. Charges that are taking real money out of the pockets of American families, these junk fees can add up hundreds of dollars, weighing down family budgets, and making it harder to pay family bills. These junk fees may not matter to the wealthy, but they sure matter to working folks in homes like the one I grew up in. The way I think about, it’s the way my dad talked about it, and the way so many of you at home talk about it around the kitchen table. How much are your monthly bills and after they’re all paid, how much do you have left for necessities? Is there enough leftover just to give you a little bit of breathing room? Well, these junk fees suck up all that breathing room among other things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:09)', 'Speech': 'Now, think of today how many folks are asking how much more do they have to pay to cover those hidden junk fees that really add up? Over the past two years, my administration has taken with the help of the members of Congress, a number of steps to crack down an unfair and deceptive junk fees in banking, hotels, concert, airlines, retail housing, excuse me, rental housing, cable, internet, healthcare, a whole range of issues, a whole range of them. For example, two summers ago, if your flight was canceled or delayed, almost no major airline guarantee anything other than costing you a fee to rebook that, even if it was their fault, you had to pay a fee to rebook. Now, 10 airlines rebook for free. I’m looking to get the law passed so none of them can, they all have to do that. And that’s a win for consumers. Other companies have also responded to my call for action and adopt the so called All in Upfront Pricing. That’s where companies fully disclose their fees upfront when you start shopping, and there’s no real surprise at the end when you check out.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:25)', 'Speech': 'This summer, I hosted business leaders at an event to announce the voluntary changes at companies like Airbnb, Dice, and others were making to provide customers with an All in Upfront Pricing so there’s no surprise. Tens of millions of Americans have already benefited from this, and that’s progress. Today, I’m proud to announce that my administration has taken our most comprehensive action ever to eliminate junk fees and fees in industries and sectors across the board, across the entire economy. If these rules are finalized, they won’t just be voluntarily, they’ll be made mandatory, mandatory. It will do more than embarrass the company and make them mandatory. But first, here’s how. The Federal Trade Commission is proposing a new rule that would ban hidden fees across the economy and require companies to show consumers the All In Pricing upfront, upfront. And that includes what these fees are for, how much they amount to in full, and whether they are refundable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:34)', 'Speech': 'Research shows that without realizing it, folks can end up paying as much as 20% more because of hidden junk fees than they would’ve paid if they could see the full price upfront and compare it with other options. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just taking advantage of people and it makes it harder for honest businesses who are trying to do the right thing to compete with dishonest companies who trick customers into thinking their price are lower when they in fact are not. Look, if this proposed rule is finalized as proposed, the FTC would have the power to impose financial penalties on companies that don’t disclose their full upfront price and secure refunds for customers who have been defrauded by companies charging hidden fees. Second, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is banning bank fees and credit unions for charging fees for basic service like checking your account balance, checking your account balance, retrieving old bank records or looking up your balance on a loan.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:44)', 'Speech': 'Some banks charge as much as $30 for these services every time you’d call. It’s outrageous. It’s really outrageous. And today they’re making clear that these fees are now illegal. Look, we’re not stopping there. There are tens of billions of dollars in other junk fees across the economy and I have directed my administration to crack down on them as well. For example, later this month, the CFPB will propose another new rule that would require banks to make it easier for customers to switch banks, something banks have made really difficult for folks to do. This new rule would increase competition and deter junk fees. All of these actions are going to make a real difference in people’s lives. We’re already seeing how. Today, for example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a report showing that since I took office, nearly two thirds of the largest banks have eliminated bounced check fees entirely. That was a lot of money. And by the way, they calculated these bounced check fees for consumers have declined by nearly $2 billion. This isn’t chump change. It’s a lot of money, by $2 billion, and that’s close to a 90% reduction.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:04)', 'Speech': 'In addition, we’ve secured $140 million in refunds for consumers who were charged illegal junk fees by these banks. And look, and we’re also sending new guidance to every federal agency on how they can promote real competition in their work. And as we take these acts as I continue to call on Congress to pass, what my friends in the front row here mostly support Junk Fee Prevention Act, hard to say. Anyway, but all kidding aside, I’m asking Congress to take the action so this makes it a matter of law. Today’s actions are part of my broader economic vision, to move from trickle down economics to what everyone in the Wall Street Journal of Financial Times begin to call Bidenomics. I don’t think they meant it as a compliment at first. It’s about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Last week’s jobs report shows Bidenomics is working. We added 336,000 jobs last month. We created more than 13,900,000 new jobs since I’ve taken office. That’s more than any president ever has in all of history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:21)', 'Speech': 'And the unemployment rate has stayed below 4% for 20 straight months, the longest stretch in 50 years. And inflation continues to fall down nearly 60% from last summer, and now we have the lowest inflation of any major economy in the world, and we’re going to make it lower. And in August, we announced the first 10 prescription drugs that Medicare selected for negotiation under the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s a fancy way of saying, for many years, big pharma blocked us along the way, they kept prescription drug prices high and increased their profits, extended patents on their existing drugs, and then suppressed the competition instead of innovating. By the way, you order a prescription drug made in the United States America, you buy it in New York City, or Washington DC, or Omaha, Nebraska, it costs a hell of a lot more than the same exact drug by the same company sold in Toronto, Canada, London, Rome, anywhere else in the world, same exact drug. Playing games with pricing so they could charge whatever they want, but this time we finally beat big pharma. How long have we been trying to do this?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:40)', 'Speech': 'This has been going on a long time. None of the women in the front row here have been around for more than two or three years, but some of the guys have been here for a hell of a long time. But all kidding aside, think about it, we’ve been fighting this fight for a long, long time, long before I was president or vice president. We passed the inflation reduction act with no help for many of our Republican friends. Every single one voted against it, but maybe they’ll see the light. And among many important things it does, it finally gives Medicare the ability to negotiate lower prescription drug prices like they can do with Veterans affairs, like they do now. And by the way, that not only saves the consumer, it reduces the federal budget, because guess what, we don’t have to pay that money out of taxpayers money to reward these companies for overcharges. Something everybody forgets it’s well over a billion dollars. Anyway, I won’t get into how much it saved. I’ve kept you sitting too long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:40)', 'Speech': 'But seniors on Medicare are now paying as much as $400 a month for insulin. Well, now they’re going to pay $35 a month. And I might know it costs these companies $10 to make the insulin, 10. To package it, you might be able to get it to $12 and they’re still getting paid 35, which is almost a 300% increase, more than a 300% increase. Now, I don’t get why … Anyway, We’re also capping total out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs, it cost 10, 12, 14,000 a year. No matter what your prescription drug costs are, beginning next year, no matter how much they are, no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000, $2,000, and it matters. Look, let me close with this. When I ran for president, I promised we would not continue to trickle down economics of the past because here’s the simple truth. Trickle down economics represented the moment we walked away from how this country’s middle class was built in my view.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:48)', 'Speech': 'Not a lot of trickle down on my dad’s kitchen table, I don’t recall. Bidenomics is another way of saying, restoring the American dream, trickle down limited the dream to those at the top. But I believe that every American willing to do hard work should be able to achieve it no matter where they live in every part of the country. That’s the American dream, that’s Bidenomics and that’s why I can honestly say I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America for God’s sake. There’s nothing, I mean it sincerely, there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. So God bless you all. Thank you for the strong support and make God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

It’s a remarkable departure from where we had been when DC was a place where outing was used as a political weapon.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:55)', 'Speech': 'Tonight, we can celebrate without fear or shame, but despite the freedom and acceptance we have fought for in places like DC, we know that in too many other parts of our country, these rights and freedoms are under attack.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:18)', 'Speech': 'Across the country, in places like Texas and Florida and Alabama, LGBTQ individuals don’t have the freedom to be honest with their family or embrace their gender identity at work. They don’t have the freedom to walk down the halls of their school, as their authentic self. They don’t have the freedom to hold hands with their partner on the sidewalk.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:48)', 'Speech': 'While we celebrate this beautiful community tonight, let’s also remember how lucky we are, and harden our resolve to advocate for those who are not. We look forward to a time when all people, in all places can feel the freedom and the joy that we feel here tonight.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:22)', 'Speech': 'Until then, we fight. We fight for the trans individuals, who are being bullied and killed. We fight for the LGBTQ kids who are forced into conversion therapy. We fight for the communities around the world where being gay is punishable by death.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:46)', 'Speech': 'Joe and I stand firmly and proudly with you in these fights, and we will be with you every step of the way. There’s nobody that I’d rather have in my corner than my husband Joe Biden.

Will you be loyal to the person you love?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:15)', 'Speech': 'I was raised in that was quite a simple proposition. I’ve told the story before, but I’m telling it again. I was raised by a man who was a really decent, honorable man.

To everyone who helped make the Respect For Marriage Act a reality, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Together, we’re standing up for children. As you know better than anyone, there are young people all across America sitting in their bedrooms at night, scrolling through social media, and staring at the ceiling wondering will they ever be loved? What happens if they tell their parents? What’s going to go on?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:35)', 'Speech': 'Many of you have been through it. Will they be ever accepted by their families? Ever be free to be themselves? Whether they should even be there or here on Earth?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:46)', 'Speech': 'Nearly every day, I get letters, literally, from children and parents terrified by what’s happening all across America. A 13 year old transgender child wrote to me and said, “I hate looking at the news, not because I’m a teenager and it’s boring but because it’s painful. I hear adults, much older than me, debate about my existence when they don’t even know me.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:15)', 'Speech': 'Our message to young people across America must be unequivocal, you’re loved, you’re heard, and you’re understood, and you belong. I mean it. We see who you are, made in the image of God, deserving dignity and respect and support. That’s why my administration combating the dangerous, cruel practice of conversion therapy has been so outspoken.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:44)', 'Speech': 'That’s why we launched the nationwide prejudice hotline where LGBTQ youth who are feeling isolated and overwhelmed can get help. They just have to call 988, and talk to a counselor. 988, and talk to a counselor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:59)', 'Speech': 'This year, we’re committing even more resources, new federal action to address LGBTQ youth homelessness, new steps to protect kids in foster care. All of it matters, but for all the progress we’ve made, we know the barriers, the bias, the bigotry still exists. Perhaps because of the progress we’ve made, people want to push us back and pull us back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:25)', 'Speech': 'Over 600 hateful laws introduced across the country, more than 70 of them becoming law just this last year, denying the existence of transgender people, silencing teachers, banning books, threatening parents with prison for getting their children healthcare. Families across the country now face excruciating decisions to move to a different state to protect their child from the dangerous anti-LGBTQ laws.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:57)', 'Speech': 'I received a letter from one mom who wrote me, “I despair for families like mine, who will already become refugees inside our nation.” Refugees inside our nation? That’s how she feels, like a refugee inside our nation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:15)', 'Speech': 'This is the United States of America, and the United States Congress extreme MAGA Republicans trying to undo virtually every bit of progress we’ve made. They’re trying to wipe out federal funding to end the HIV epidemic, strip funding from community centers for seniors, reinstate the ban on transgender troops, ban the Department of Justice from enforcing civil rights laws, ban Pride flags from flying on public lands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:43)', 'Speech': 'Who the hell … Oh. Not very presidential. They threaten the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. These are just the cruel attacks on LGBT community. They’re attacks on the foundations of our democracy. They take aim at our fundamental values and principles, like the right to free expression, the right to make our own healthcare decisions, the right to raise our own children.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:21)', 'Speech': 'I’m never going to stand by and watch families terrorize doctors and nurses, criminalize, or any child targeted for who they are. It’s who they are. Jill and I, Kamala, Doug, and our entire administration will always stand with you against hate.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:40)', 'Speech': 'Together, we’re going to make even more progress. You’ve heard me say before, and I apologize for having to repeat it, when a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still fundamentally wrong in this country. That still exists.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:58)', 'Speech': 'That’s why we must pass the Equality Act, and pass it now. That’s what we must do. At a time when studies show violence against LGBTQ Americans is on the rise, we have to do more to keep people in the community safe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:20)', 'Speech': '25 years ago this week, Matthew Shepard was brutally taken from us. His courageous parents Judy and Dennis have turned his murder into a movement. As we remember him, we also remember the LGBTQ people and allies killed this year, like O’Shae Sibley, killed while dancing and expressing joy, Laura Ann Carleton, who simply hung a Pride flag outside of her … Think of that, she hung a Pride flag outside her home. She was killed. Colin Smith stabbed while defending a friend, and dozens of transgender Americans, especially transgender women of color killed every year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:09)', 'Speech': 'The Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Health and Human Services has launched a safety partnership to better protect festivals and marches and community centers and businesses, to better protect healthcare providers serving the community, and to help folks report hate crimes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:25)', 'Speech': 'Nearly a year after the horrific shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs, we have to fully implement the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years, and then pass again the assault weapons ban, which Diane and I passed. No excuse. Who in God’s name needs a weapon with 100 rounds in the chamber? The weapon is only meant for one thing, to kill people. We did it before. We can do it again. As long as I’m in office, I’m not going to stop until we get it done again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:04)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, let me close with this, a week ago, we saw hate manifest in another way, in the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. More than 1300 innocent lives lost in Israel, including, at least, 27 Americans. Children, and grandparents alike, kidnapped, held hostage by Hamas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:25)', 'Speech': 'The humanitarian crisis in Gaza, innocent Palestinian families and a vast majority who have nothing to do with Hamas, they’re being used as human shield. Yesterday, I spoke for over an hour with a family member of those Americans who are still unaccounted for, on a Zoom call. They’ve endured an agony of not knowing what’s happened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:52)', 'Speech': 'Not the same thing, but I can tell you what it’s like, it’s one thing to lose someone and you know you’re going to lose them and be there with them and hold their hands, like I was able to do with my son. It’s a very other thing to get a phone call, that I got years ago saying, “There’s been an accident. Your wife and daughter are dead. I’m not sure your boys are going to make it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:15)', 'Speech': 'The uncertainty, those two or three hours, trying to get back to find out. It’s the worst feeling in the world. It’s gut-wrenching. It’s yet another reminder that hate never goes away. It only hides. It hides under the rocks. I thought being so deeply involved in the civil rights movement when I was able to convince of all people, Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act in his last year, change his mind. I thought, “Well, you can defeat hate.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:52)', 'Speech': 'Guess what happened? Hate just hides under the rocks until there’s a little oxygen blown under, like what happened in Charlottesville, just a little bit, and it comes roaring out again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:08)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we have to reject hate in every form, because history has taught us, again and again, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, they’re all connected. Hate toward one group left unanswered opens the door for more hate toward more groups more often readily.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:30)', 'Speech': 'Here’s what we [inaudible 00:21:32] the antidote to hate is love. The answer to [inaudible 00:21:37] is solidarity, and standing up for everyone in humanity. That’s why the laws that actually protect equality matter. Every single American, no matter who you are, who you love, or where you come from, this shouldn’t be about conservative/liberal, red or blue. It should be about realizing the promise of the Declaration of Independence. It sounds corny, but a promise rooted in the sacred and the secular, that all people are created equal, and [inaudible 00:22:02] created with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:09)', 'Speech': 'Folks, it may sound corny but we never fully lived up to that promise, but we never walked away from it like many want us to do, and we’re not going to walk away from it on my watch, I promise you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:21)', 'Speech': 'All of you here tonight, and all the advocates and allies across the country, I see the light that’s going to triumph over the darkness. I see the hope that’s going to conquer fear. I see the love that’s going to overcome hate in all its forms.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:35)', 'Speech': 'I see a great nation, because we’re, basically, a good people. We just have to remember who we are, and we’re not the victim and, although, we’re good folks, we got to stand up and holler. We got to stand up and holler. You cannot be silent. Silence is complicity. Silence is complicity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:53)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Nothing, nothing, nothing, so let’s stand together and get everyone else on the deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:07)', 'Speech': 'God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Since the Holocaust, it was brought to the surface, painful memories and scars led by millennium antisemitism and the genocide of the Jewish people. The world watched then, it knew and the world did nothing. We will not stand by and do nothing again, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. To those who are living in limbo, waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one, especially to families of the hostages, you’re not alone. We’re working with partners throughout the region, pursuing every avenue to bring home those who are being helped captive by Hamas. I can’t speak publicly about all the details, but let me assure you, for me, as the American President, there’s no higher priority than release and safe return of all these hostages.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:24)', 'Speech': 'To those who are grieving, a child, a parent, a spouse, a sibling, a friend, I know you feel like there’s that black hole in the middle of your chest. You feel like you’re being sucked into it. The survivor’s remorse, the anger, the questions of faith in your soul, staring at that empty chair, sitting in Shiva, the first Sabbath without them, they’re the everyday things and small things that you miss the most. The scent when you open the closet door, the morning coffee you shared together, the bend of his smile, the perfect picture of her laugh, the giggle, every little boy, the baby. For those who have lost loved ones, this is what I know: they’ll never be truly gone. There’s something that’s never fully lost; your love for them and their love for you. And I promise you, you’ll be walking along some days and say, “What would she or he want me to do?” You smile when you pass a place that reminds you of them. That’s when, you know a smile comes to your lift before a tear to your eye, that’s when you know you’re going to fully make it. That’s what will give you the fortitude to find light in the darkest hours.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:42)', 'Speech': 'When terrorists believe they could bring you down, bend your will, break your resolve. But they never did and they never will. Instead, we saw incredible stories of heroism and courage. Israelis taking care of one another. Neighbors forming watch groups protect their kibbutz, opening their homes to shelter survivors, retired soldiers running into danger once again. Civilian medics flying rescue missions, and off-duty medics at the music festival caring for the wounded before becoming a victim himself. Volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition. Reservists leaving behind their families, their honeymoons, their studies abroad without hesitation and so much more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:41)', 'Speech': 'The state of Israel was born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world. That’s why it was born. Long said, “If Israel didn’t exist, we’d have to invent it.” While it may not feel that way today, Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people, and I promise you, we’re going to do everything in our power to make sure that it will be.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:06)', 'Speech': '75 years ago, just 11 minutes after it’s founding, President Harry S Truman in the United States of America became the first nation to recognize Israel. We’ve stood by her side ever since, we’re going to stand by her side now. My administration was in close touch with your leadership. From the first moments of this attack, we’re going to make sure we have what you need to protect your people to defend your nation. For decades, we’ve ensured Israel’s qualitative military edge, and later this week, I’m going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support package for Israel’s defense.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:49)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied, so we can continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving Israeli lives. We move US military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford Carrier Strike Group in eastern Mediterranean with USS Eisenhower on the way to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading. The world will know that Israel is stronger than ever, and my message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel remains the same as it was a week ago. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. Since terrorist attack took place, we’ve seen it described as Israel’s 9/11, but for a nation the size of Israel was like 15 9/11s. The scale may be different, but I’m sure those horrors have tapped into some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it did and felt in the United States. Shock, pain, rage, an all consuming rage. I understand and many Americans understand.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:05)', 'Speech': 'You can’t look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children, even babies, and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done, but I caution this while you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes. I’m the first US president to visit Israel in time of war. I’ve made wartime decisions. I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. There’s always cost, but it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:03)', 'Speech': 'The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses innocent families in Gaza as human shields, putting their command centers, their weapons, their communications tunnels in residential areas. Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well. We mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives, like the entire world I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in the hospital in Gaza. Based on the information we’ve seen today, it appears a result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza. United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict, and I grieve, I truly grieve for the families who are killed or wounded by this tragedy. And people of Gaza need food, water, medicine, shelter. Today, I asked the Israeli Cabinet I met with for some time this morning to agree to the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza, based on the understanding that there will be inspections and that the age should go to civilians, not to Hamas. Is it agree the humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza. Let me be clear. If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people and it will end. As a practical matter, it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:42)', 'Speech': 'Working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt, the United Nations and its agencies like the World Program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible. Separately, I ask Israel that the global community demand that the International Red Cross be able to visit hostages. I demand that the United States fully supports, today I’m also announcing $100 million in new US funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank. This money will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict affected Palestinians, including emergency needs in Gaza.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:28)', 'Speech': 'You are a Jewish state. You are a Jewish state, but you’re also a democracy. And like the United States, you don’t live by the rules of terrorists. You live by the rule of law, and when conflicts flare, you live by the law of wars. What sets us apart from the terrorists as we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life; Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, Jew, Muslim, Christian, everyone, you can’t give up what makes you who you are. If you give that up, then the terrorists win and we can never let them win.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:08)', 'Speech': 'Israel’s a miracle, a triumph of faith, and resolve and resilience over impossible pain and loss. Think about October 7th, a Jewish holiday where you read about the death of Moses, a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation, a death that could have left hopelessness in the hearts of an entire nation. But though Moses died, his memory, his message, his lessons have lived on for generations of the Jewish people as well as many others, and just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as well. After reading the story of Moses’ death, those who observed the holiday began reading the Torah from the very beginning. The story of creation reminds us of two things. First, that when we get knocked down, we get back up again and we begin anew. And second, when we’re faced with tragedy and loss, we must go back to the beginning and remember who we are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:12)', 'Speech': 'We are all human beings, created in the image of God with dignity, humanity, and purpose. In the darkness, to be the light unto the world is what we’re about. You inspire hope and light for so many around the world. That’s what the terrorists seek to destroy. That’s what they seek to destroy because they live in darkness, but not you, not Israel. Nations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example of power, and were measured by the power of our example, and that’s why as hard as it is, we must keep pursuing peace. Must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely in security, and dignity and in peace. For me, that means that two state solution. We must keep working for Israel’s greater integration with his neighbors, these attacks and only strengthen my commitment and determination and my will to get that done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:17)', 'Speech': 'I’m here to tell you, the terrorists will not win. Freedom will win. So let me end where I began. Israel, you’re not alone. The United States stands with you. I’ve told the story before and I’ll tell it again of my first meeting with an Israeli Prime Minister 50 years ago as a young senator. I was sitting across from Golda Meir at her desk in her office, and she had a guy who later became Prime Minister sitting next to me just before the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And she flipped the maps up and down telling me how bad things were and how terrible they were. All of a sudden she looked at me, she said, “Would you like a photograph?” I looked at her, she got up from her desk and walked out into that hallway, I think it’s marble flooring, walked out in the hallway and walked down, there were a bunch of photographers standing in front of us. We were standing shoulder to shoulder without her looking at me, she said to me, knowing I’d hear her, “Why do you look so worried, Senator Biden?” And I said, “Worried? Of course I’m worried.” And she looked at me and she didn’t look, she said, “Don’t worry, Senator. We Israelis have a secret weapon; we have nowhere else to go.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:42)', 'Speech': 'Well, today I say to all of Israel, the United States isn’t going anywhere either. We’re going to stand with you. We’ll walk beside you in those dark days and we’ll walk beside you in the good days to come and they will come. As you say, in Hebrew, which I’m not going to attempt to do because I’m such a terrible linguist, I’ll say in English, the people of Israel live, the people of Israel live. Israel will be safe, secure, Jewish and democratic state, today, tomorrow, and forever. May God protect all those who work for peace. God save those who are still in harm’s way. Thank you very much.'}]"

We brought together 38 consortium partners, academic institutions, local startups, major corporations and our regional economic organizations and electeds to position our region as a global hub for predictive technologies that improve health and wellbeing. Over the next decade, we envision the economic impact could be staggering. More than $4.2 billion and 52,000 jobs could be created through this innovation. We found ourself a real partner in this endeavor. Thanks to President Biden’s leadership and the support of our state and local partners, Baltimore is poised to become one of the world’s top biotech and artificial intelligence hubs. And so many communities just like ours are now set to become true economic powerhouses. It is now my honor and my privilege to introduce a true champion for innovation; President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:33)', 'Speech': 'Second, the bill created what we call tech hubs as part of the bill. A tech hub, we’re going to invest in critical technologies like biotechnology, critical materials, quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, so the US will lead the world again in innovation across the board. These hubs all around the country will bring together private industry, higher education, state and local governments, tribes, and organized labor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:03)', 'Speech': 'Today we’re announcing that 31 tech hubs spread across the entire company will be able to compete for up to $75 million each to accelerate and scale up their work, and I want to thank majority leader, Chuck Schumer and Senator Todd Young and representative, excuse me, representatives Joe Morelle and Susan Wild for their work to make this happen. Representatives for many of these hubs are on the screen behind me, and in front of me there’s … That’s why I was starting to look to see whether if they’re still there. The work they’re doing is transformational.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:43)', 'Speech': 'For example, a tech hub in Wisconsin is going to bring together research labs, medical device manufacturers and engineers. They’re going to build technology that supports personalized medicine like tests, treatments, and therapies, specifically tailored to a patient’s genetic code and medical records, and I believe it’s going to save a lot of lives in the long run. Ohio, the largest concentration of rubber and plastic manufacturing in North America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:11)', 'Speech': 'In the Ohio Hub, businesses and universities are going to come together to develop sustainable plastic and rubber technology that can be produced with fewer emissions and is able to be recycled and is biodegradable and is nontoxic, which is going to significantly impact on the environment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:29)', 'Speech': 'These hubs are also making sure workers get the skills they need to do these jobs. For example, the leadership of Majority Leader Schumer, a hub in upstate New York, is going to support a workforce training program for New York semiconductor industry, which by the way has seen tens of billions of dollars, billions of dollars in new investments because of the Chips and Science Act. This hub will have a particular focus on training people from communities historically left behind, like women, people of color to work in the semiconductor industry. The list goes on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:03)', 'Speech': 'We’re doing this from coast to coast and in the heartland and red states and blue states, small towns, cities of all sizes. All this is part of my strategy to invest in America and invest in Americans. It’s working. We’re creating good jobs in communities all across the country, including places where for decades, factories have been shut down, hollowed out, when jobs moved overseas to find cheaper employment. Over the past few decades, these communities lost more than jobs. They lost a sense of their sense of dignity, of opportunity, sense of pride. We’re going to change all that.

My plan is to changing that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:18)', 'Speech': 'Under Bidenomics, we’re going to make sure America’s future is made in America. It’s leading to a manufacturing boom, attracting over $600 billion so far in private investment in American manufacturing and our clean energy future. For too long, we looked around the world to find corporations, looked around the world to find the cheapest employment, and then imported the products they made, the foreign product. Now we’re creating American jobs and exporting American products, and that’s good for everybody.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:50)', 'Speech': 'These tech hubs will be transformational and they’re part of a long line of transformational investments we’ve made since I took office and as a result, I truly believe this country is about to take off because for the first time in a long time, we’re investing in America and we’re investing in American people.

We’ve all seen the devastating images from Gaza, Palestinian children crying out for lost parents, parents reasoning and writing their children’s names on their hands and legs to be identified if the worst happens. It’s okay, kids are allowed to do that with me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:15)', 'Speech': 'Look, creating opportunities for family, farmers and tribal communities across the country is what we’re trying to do here. Tim, Governor Walz. Governor, thank you for the great work and the partnership and what you’re doing here in Minnesota. Mayor Rhonda, where’s Rhonda, the mayor? There you are, mayor, thank you for being here as well. I appreciate it, and thank you for the passport into the city. I don’t get many passports these days. Over the past 40 years or so, we’ve had a practice in America, economic practice called trickle-down economics, and it hit rural America especially hard. It hollowed out Main Street telling farmers the only path to success was to get big or get out. Tax cuts for big corporations encouraged companies to grow bigger and bigger, moved jobs and production overseas for cheaper labor and undercut local small businesses.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:22)', 'Speech': 'Meat producing companies and the retail grocery chains consolidated, leaving farmers with ranches with few choices about where to sell their products, reducing their bargaining power. Corporations that sell seed, fertilizer and even farm equipment used their outsized market power to change farmers and charge them and ranchers unfair prices. In part because of these conditions, over the past four decades, we lost over 400,000 farms in America, 400,000, over 141 million acres of farmland. That’s an area roughly equal to the size of Minnesota and North and South Dakota combined, the three. Facing higher costs and earning less, family farms have struggled to make it work, to make the math work. The promise of keeping the farm in the family is slipping out of reach for so many across America. When family farms go by the wayside, small businesses, hospitals, schools that support them, they suffer as well in the community.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:29)', 'Speech': 'As a result, farmers and ranchers and rural business owners, including scores of young people, have to leave home in search of good-paying jobs and a chance at the American dream. All over rural America, young people are saying to their parents, “I can’t live here anymore. I can’t do it because I can’t find a job. You gave me an education, but there’s nothing for me here. I got to leave.” I came to office determined to change that. By the way, parenthetically, I come from a state that people think is all manufacturing, DuPont, all that goes, but it’s also a $4 billion industry in agriculture in the Del Mar Peninsula, almost all chickens and soybeans, but I watch what happened in my community. I watch what happened all across America. Now we’re growing an economy from the middle out and the bottom up instead of the top down. Folks, there’s a practical reason for that. When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well. It’s everybody does better.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:36)', 'Speech': 'When rural America does well, when Indian country does well, we all do well. Folks in the press have been calling my plan Bidenomics. Well, it’s about investing in all, all of America, all America, including rural America. It’s about making things in rural America again, and that’s exactly what the historic legislation we passed has done, creating new and better markets and new income streams so that generations of rural Americans can begin to thrive again. For example, through our clean energy initiatives contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, we’re investing nearly $20 billion, 20 billion. The money’s there to help farmers and ranchers tackle climate crisis, through climate smart agriculture and cover crops, nutrient management. Is God great? Storing carbon in the soil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions while improving overall health of the soil and the water.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:40)', 'Speech': 'Instead of doing, doing what they have to do now, depending on one income stream and being at the mercy of the commodity markets and the big corporations, under our plan, farmers can diversify and earn additional income. Just selling into the local markets, it matters. Let me give you an example. When a farmer sells his commodities normally you have to go through the grocery store. The farmers get about 18 cents for every federal dollar, excuse me, every dollar they had. Sometimes they get less than that, some, but… But when a farmer sells locally, the farmers can get anything from 50 to 75 cents for the same exact product. In addition to producing renewable energy and taking advantage of the bioeconomy, the result of family farms that were barely making ends meet used these funds provided to improve their bottom line after being squeezed by big corporations for so long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:46)', 'Speech': 'Look, we’re also promoting competition and agricultural markets. For too long, farmers like Brad and his brother and his dad and mom have had to sell their hogs, not just to a handful of meat processors, there’s only a handful that existed, outsized control over the industry and they set the prices as well. Let me put this perspective to you. Just four big corporations control more than half the market in beef, pork and poultry. Because so few companies control so much of the market, if one of those processing plants goes offline, it can cause massive supply chain disruptions, slowing production and cost farmers big. It happened to Brad when processing plants shut down during the pandemic and he had to rely on social media to sell his hogs. Folks, look, there’s something wrong when just 7% of the American farms get nearly 90%, 7% get 90% of the farm income, and most farmers rely on jobs off the farm to be able to make ends meet on the farm. When I took office, I decided to invest a billion dollars through the American Rescue Plan in small and medium-sized independent meat processors to expand their capacity.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:25)', 'Speech': 'And guess what? The South Korean company came along and they’re going to invest $200 billion, oh, excuse me, $20 billion, they’re going to invest over $350 billion in building these chips. Everything in our lives from cell phones to automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapon systems rely on these. I might add the factory being used to produce these chips, they call them fabs, employ thousands of people. You know what the average salary in those factories are going to be? Over a hundred thousand dollars a year and you don’t need a college degree.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:20)', 'Speech': 'My plan is about investing in rural America. It’s about something else as well. It’s about restoring pride to rural communities that have been left behind for far too long. No, you really have. It’s not a hyperbole. For decades, family like Brad’s sat around in the kitchen table with their kids and grandkids worried, wondering, “How can we keep the farm in the family?” Because of these investments we’re making family farms like this one will stay in the family and the children and grandchildren like Brad won’t have to leave home to make a living.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:47)', 'Speech': 'Think about this, we’ve always come out of every conflict we’ve gotten into, we’ve always come out of every problem we’ve had stronger than we went in. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. Think about it. Anything we’ve ever set our mind to as a nation, we’ve never failed to succeed, not a joke, never failed to succeed. Nothing’s beyond our capacity. When we do it together, so let’s unite this country. Let’s do it together. Let’s make sure that those who want to stay in the farm can stay on it as long as they want because they make a good decent living. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

We saw it in the actions of our people, a bar manager, a bowling coach, many others to forfeit their own safety in order to protect those around them. We saw in the off-duty LPD officers rushing towards the sound of gunfire. We saw it in the nurses and doctors working around the clock in trauma units. We saw as thousands gathered at the basilica on Sunday to mourn our dead. We’ve seen it in countless acts of kindness and compassion, small and large, over the past 10 days. Lewiston is a magnificent city and our collective strength is far greater than any number of bullets. No community can confront a challenge like this on its own. I’d like to thank main state police, the many municipal, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, Governor Mills and her administration, and our entire federal delegation, including Senator Collins and King, and Representative Golden for the incredible work they’ve done to support our city. And as we responded to this crisis, we received unconditional support and assistance from the man to my left, President Joe Biden and his administration.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:57)', 'Speech': 'On behalf of our city.

We also remember the survivors who will forever carry the memories and the physical emotional scars of this. They should be embraced. I know you will. I know you do. As we mourn today in Maine, this tragedy opens a painful, painful wounds all across the country. Too many Americans have lost loved ones or survived the trauma of gun violence. I know because Jill and I have met with them in Buffalo and Uvalde, in Monterey Park and Sandy Hook and all [inaudible 00:05:51]. Anyway, too many to count. Too many to count from places that never make the news all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:59)', 'Speech': 'It’s about bringing people together, different voices and perspectives for an honest conversation and what’s to be a long road to recovery. And I’ve been at this a long time. I know consensus is ultimately possible. This is about common sense, reasonable and responsible measures to protect our children, our families, our communities. Because regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant, a school, a church without being shot and killed. Let me close with this. Scripture says the Lord is near to the broken hearted and saves the crushed in spirit, and saves the crushed in spirit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:02)', 'Speech': 'Our prayer is that the crushed in spirit survive this more rapidly than otherwise. As we gather here today, we know your hearts are broken, but we also know your spirits are strong. The way this community has come together, the way this state has come together has been a marvel for the rest of the country. So God bless those we lost, those who have been wounded. May God bless the first responders as well, as the nurses. I told the nurses, docs, if there’s any angels in heaven, male and female nurses are the ones that are in heaven. Docs let you live. Nurses make you want to live for a guy who spent a lot of time in ICU. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, I’d like to invite Senator Collins to come up and say a few words as well.

To my friends in the deaf community, stay strong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:35)', 'Speech': 'But I want you to know that when he and I went back to Washington this week, we were instantly embraced by our colleagues from all over the country, some of them sharing stories of the horrific shootings that had happened in their districts, but all of them saying that they had been watching what had been going on in Maine every second of the way, that they were there to help us, that they were there to support our state in any possible way. And last night, Jared read a beautiful tribute on the floor, the two of us, the delegation of two from Maine and the Main House of Representatives. But he did a wonderful tribute to his home community, to those lives that were lost to what we need, to do moving forward. So I’m very pleased to be here with all of you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:11)', 'Speech': 'I don’t live in Lewiston, but I represent half of the state of Maine.

I realized that damage to the environment was not just a theoretical issue in textbooks, it affects our everyday lives. I knew I needed to get involved, so I joined Earth Club at my school and became active in cleanup efforts and service projects. My classmates and I collected trash and debris and learned about the importance of our recycling system. We also learned about the effects of climate change, from rising temperatures to ocean pollution and extreme weather events that harm all of our communities. That’s why I decided to enter the National Climate Assessments first ever art competition.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:16)', 'Speech': 'Through my artwork, I wanted to show the urgency of the climate crisis, but I also wanted to show that solutions to protect our planet are at our fingertips. I wanted to inspire people about what we are capable of as a country. I’m very honored to be among the winners of the art competition and grateful to my family for their support. I’m also honored to be here today to introduce the greatest climate leader America has ever had. President Biden understands what’s at stake for my generation if we don’t act now to combat climate change. It is now my privilege to introduce President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:51)', 'Speech': 'Well, I told Ritika when she’s president, don’t forget me. Ritika, thank you for that introduction and your beautiful artwork. You all see the artwork? Can you see it up here? It’s on the right side. I don’t know whether you can see it. And thank you all of you, for the climate scientists and experts who are here today and all across the country who’ve contributed this critical endeavor. I particularly want to thank Allison Crimmins, who put together the team to write this report and what we’re releasing today, it was an easy thing to do. Not much to it. Only about 700 people [inaudible 00:02:43].'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:43)', 'Speech': 'Well, more than 30 years ago, Congress passed a law that called for a detailed scientific report on the impacts of global changes in the environment. Since then, these assessments delivered to the Congress and the president have been the go-to resource in America for information on climate change and for developing climate solutions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:03)', 'Speech': 'Today I’m proud to announce that my administration just released the Fifth Climate Assessment in our nation’s history. It didn’t just come out of thin air. Written over four years, 750 authors and experts. Thousands, thousands of American contributors from every single state in the nation, as well as several territories and tribes. It’s the most comprehensive assessment on state climate change in the history of America and it matters. This assessment shows us, in clear scientific terms, that climate change is impacting all regions, all sectors of the United States, not just some. All. It shows that communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risk. It warns that more action is still badly needed. We can’t be complacent. Let me say that again. We can’t be complacent. We have to keep going. Above all, it shows us that climate action offers an opportunity for the nation to come together and do some really big things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:08)', 'Speech': 'I’ve seen firsthand what the reports made clear, the devastating total climate change and its existential threat to all of us and is the ultimate threat to humanity, climate change. I’ve walked the streets of Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Puerto Rico, where historic hurricanes and floods wiped out homes, hospitals, houses of worship just wiped them right off the map. I met with families in Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi, where catastrophic winter storms and tornadoes devoured everything in their path. Schools, businesses, police stations, firehouse. I’ve seen firefighters in Idaho, Maui, and New Mexico, California, Colorado, where wildfires stored whole neighborhoods and sacred tribal sites, spreading smoky haze thousands of miles, forcing millions of Americans to shelter indoors and unsafe air to breathe.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:03)', 'Speech': 'Look, and by the way, and I’ve flown over all these areas in helicopters, they tell me that more of our forest land, forest, has burned to the ground than make up the entire state of New Jersey. The entire state. Some say Maryland, New Jersey. But the forest is… That’s just gigantic and has incredible impacts. Record temperatures in Texas, Arizona, and elsewhere affecting lives and livelihoods of more than 100 million Americans. And this summer and this fall have been the Earth’s hottest since the global records began to be kept in the 1800s. Think about that. The hottest we’ve ever recorded in history. It’s an impact decades in making because inaction for much too long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:57)', 'Speech': 'Look. We’re acting now. We have been acting. We’ve come to the point where it’s foolish for anyone to deny the impacts of climate change anymore. But it’s simply a simple fact that there are a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, MAGA Republican leaders who still deny climate change, still deny that it’s a problem. My predecessors, much of the MAGA Republican party, in fact feel very strongly about that. Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. The impacts we’re seeing are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious, and more costly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:38)', 'Speech': 'Last year alone, natural disasters in America caused $178 billion, $178 billion in damages. They hit everyone no matter what their circumstances, but they hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Seniors, people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn. Black, brown and tribal communities, territories that are most exposed and have the fewest resources. But folks, none of this is inevitable. None of it’s inevitable. From day one, my administration has taken unprecedented climate action. We’re working with everyone from mayors to county officials, to entrepreneurs to academics. Business leaders, labor leaders, tribal leaders. We’re focused in all parts of America, city, suburbs, small towns and rural communities and tribal nations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:31)', 'Speech': 'And here’s how. We’re using a law that got passed when I first came to office called the American Rescue Plan to help states and cities become more resilient to climate change, promoting energy efficiency by weatherizing homes. Reducing flooding by building infrastructure to handle storm surges. Opening cooling centers where there’s particular great heat impact and people need a shelter. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which I signed two years ago, and the most significant investment in our nation’s infrastructure in American history. Roads, bridges, ports, airports, high speed internet. It delivers clean water to your community, lowers your energy bills, upgrades your electric grid so you don’t have to power them… So you don’t have to lose power. I should say, when storms and heat waves hit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:25)', 'Speech': 'The CHIPS and Science Act, I signed last year… Excuse me. I signed last year… Excuse me. I signed last year positions us to lead this in semiconductor manufacturing innovation, which is critical to clean energy development and deployment. Semiconductors are those small little computer chips you all know, the size of the tip of your little finger that power everything in our lives. From smartphones to appliances. We invented those chips, we invented them. And where the other countries started making them and we weren’t. Not anymore. We’re making these chips here in America and my Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate investment ever anywhere in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:14)', 'Speech': 'Among many things it does, it offers tax credits to make your home more energy efficient, upgrading windows and doors to keep drafts out and heat in. Tax credits to installing electric heat pumps and solar panels on your roof, saving hundreds of dollars against your family bills. Tax credits to buy electric vehicles as we build the electric vehicle future here in America. We’re transforming clean energy development that’s threatening good paying jobs, including union jobs in all of America. We’ve attracted a half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars in private sector investment from my Investing in America Agenda and clean energy and advanced manufacturing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:59)', 'Speech': 'And we’re just getting started. I mean, really are. We’re just getting started. All told, my Investing in America Agenda and those bold climate laws are the most ambitious in American history. Today’s release, the Fifth National Climate Assessment is a critical part of that effort. It lays out the threats and dangers, but most exports would acknowledge it also shows solutions are within reach. Solutions are within reach. It takes time for the investments we’re making to be fully materialized, but we just have to keep at it. We need to do more and move faster. We have the tools to do it. And for the first time ever, we’re also releasing a report with a new online tool that I just was shown a moment ago in the other room, so everyone can explore exactly what’s happening in their state, their city and their county by going online to whitehouse.gov/nca. Whitehouse.gov/nca.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:05)', 'Speech': 'That’s very different from the previous administration that tried to bury this report. They didn’t even want to make sure this report even came to light. We’re sharing this report in detail with the American people so they know exactly what they’re facing and what we’re going to have to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:25)', 'Speech': 'But that’s not all. Along with this assessment, I’m announcing $6 billion in new investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law to make communities across the country more resilient to climate change. This funding will be administered by the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior and the Federal Emergency Management Agency that’s going to be focused on key climate goals, including modernizing our aging electric grid to withstand extreme weather, which is causing these forest fires. When those towers come down, the lines snap, they catch fire. The forest catch fire. It costs a lot more money to bury these underground and do other things, but we have to do it and it’s causing significant outages as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:13)', 'Speech': 'Reducing flood risk in communities, improving drought resilience, supporting conservation for our national parks. I’ve already been able to conserve 21 million acres of our most precious and sacred lands and waters just thus far, just in the first two and a half years. Advancing environmental justice for disadvantaged communities because they’re the ones always left behind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:35)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. Last week I stopped by the White House Demo Day to meet with the scientists and experts overseeing groundbreaking and cutting edge science and technology that my administration is funding right now, right here, in America. It was truly inspirational hearing from experts and all across the government, the private sector and academia, touching on so many fields. I saw a prosthetic arm that can sense touch and it’s controlled by one’s thoughts. A prosthetic arm, it’s just like your hand. You think you want to move your finger? Well worked out, you think he wants to move his hand, he can do it. It’s an incredible breakthrough.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:19)', 'Speech': 'Electric heat pumps to help old homes, transition to clean energy homes to the future. Robots for ocean exploration that survey marine life along on mapped sea floors where barely any light penetrates and so much more. It was a reminder, at least for me, of what I’ve long believed that America can be defined by a single word. I mean this sincerely, a single that I was asked by Xi Jinping years ago when we were in the Tibetan Plateau, could I define America? I said, “Yeah, one word. Possibilities.” Possibilities. In this administration, America will be the place where great science changes what’s possible. That’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just said remember who we are, we’re the United States of America and there’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

He and I agreed that either one of us could pick up the phone, call directly, and we’d be heard immediately.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:10)', 'Speech': 'And that’s… Now I’d like to be able to take some questions, if I may. And I’m told that Demetri of the Financial Times has the first question.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:05)', 'Speech': 'And so, that’s about the extent to which we discussed it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:12)', 'Speech': 'Next question, sorry, was Bloomberg.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:38)', 'Speech': 'And secondly, if I could, on Taiwan. You and your administration officials have warned President Xi and China about interference in the upcoming election. I’m wondering what would the consequences be if they do, in fact, interfere in the election. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:02)', 'Speech': 'Look, do I trust? You know, I “trust but verify,” as the old saying goes. That’s where I am.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:09)', 'Speech': 'And, you know, we’re in a competitive relationship, China and the United States. But my responsibility is to make this rational and manageable so it doesn’t result in conflict.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:28)', 'Speech': 'That’s what I’m all about, and that’s what this is about: to find a place where we can come together and where we find mutual interests that… But, most importantly, from my perspective, that are in the interests of the American people. That’s what this is about, and that’s exactly what we’ll do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:48)', 'Speech': 'We’re in a situation where we agreed that fentanyl and its precursors will be curbed substantially. And the pill presses, that’s a big movement they’re doing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:02)', 'Speech': 'And, by the way, you know, I won’t… I guess I shouldn’t identify where it occurred. But, John, I know two people near where I live. Their kids literally, as I said, they woke up dead. Someone had inserted in… Whether the young man did or not, inserted in a drug he was taking, fentanyl.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:26)', 'Speech': 'Again, I hope you don’t have any experience with knowing anyone, but this is the largest killer of people in that age category.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:36)', 'Speech': 'And, you know, I guess the other thing I think is most important is that since I… I’ve spent more time with President Xi than any world leader has, just because we were vice presidents. His president was President Hu; I’m not making a joke. President Hu and President Obama thought we should get to know one another. It wasn’t appropriate for the President of United States to be walking, dealing with the vice president.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:09)', 'Speech': 'So we met… If I’m not mistaken, I think it was 68 hours of just face-to-face… Just us and a simultaneous interpreter.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:18)', 'Speech': 'So, I think I know the man. I know his modus operandi. He’s been… We have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things. But he’s been straight. I don’t mean that he’s good, bad, or indifferent. He’s just been straight.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:33)', 'Speech': 'And so, you know, we… As I said, the thing that I find most assuring is he raised and I fully agreed that if either one of us have any concern, Mr. Ambassador, any concern about anything between our nations or happening in our region, we should pick up the phone and then call one another, and we’ll take the call. That’s an important progress.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:00)', 'Speech': 'I’m embarrassed. I think it’s CBS, but I can’t remember who with CBS. I’m sorry.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:49)', 'Speech': 'Number two, you may recall: I did a few little things like get the Quad together, allow Australia to have access to new submarines, moving in the direction of working with the Philippines. So, our actions speak louder than our words. He fully understands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:25)', 'Speech': 'This week, you also said that we must protect hospitals. So, when you weigh the target against the number of civilians inside the hospital, is the operation underway justified?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:50)', 'Speech': 'Here’s the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military, hidden under a hospital. And that’s a fact. That’s what’s happened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:06)', 'Speech': 'Israel did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did not rush everything down. They’ve gone in and they’ve gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns. They were told… Told, let me be precise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:25)', 'Speech': 'We’ve discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful. You have a circumstance where you know there is a fair number of Hamas terrorists. Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, to where they were cutting babies’ heads off to burning women and children alive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:50)', 'Speech': 'And so, the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic. This is not the carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels. They’re going in the hospital.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:02)', 'Speech': 'And if you notice, I was mildly preoccupied today. I apologize. I didn’t see everything. But what I did see, whether… I haven’t had it confirmed yet. I have asked my team to answer the question. But what happened is they’re also bringing in incubators. They’re bringing in other means to help the people in the hospital, and they’ve given the doctors and — I’m told — the doctors and nurses and personnel an opportunity to get out of harm’s way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:32)', 'Speech': 'So, this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an indiscriminate bombing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:40)', 'Speech': 'What do you got? Washington Post. I think that’s right.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:49)', 'Speech': 'But I have… We’ve gotten great cooperation from the Qataris. I’ve spoken with them as well a number of times. I think the pause and that the Israelis have agreed to is down to… I’m getting into too much detail. I know, Mr. Secretary. I’m going to stop.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:14)', 'Speech': 'But I am mildly hopeful. I’m mildly hopeful.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:20)', 'Speech': 'With regard to when is this going to stop, I think it’s going to stop when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse and just do horrific things to the Israelis. And they are in… And they still think they… At least as of this morning, they still thought they could.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:48)', 'Speech': 'I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing in the hospital, knocking down doors, and, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:21)', 'Speech': 'But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking the Israelis again. And this is a terrible dilemma. So, what do you do?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:34)', 'Speech': 'I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed one-to-one going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel below this hospital and, I suspect, others. But how long it’s going to last, I don’t know.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:59)', 'Speech': 'Look, I made it clear to the Israelis that… And to Bibi and to his War Cabinet that I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that’s real. We got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not we’re just dealing with… They’re dealing with Hamas, that’s going to engage in the same activities they did over the past… On the 7th.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:33)', 'Speech': 'So, it’s… But I can’t tell. I’m not a fortuneteller. I can’t tell you how long it’s going to last. But I can tell you I don’t think it ultimately ends until there’s a two-state solution. I made it clear to the Israelis I think it’s a big mistake for them to think they’re going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. I don’t think that works.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:51)', 'Speech': 'And so, we’re going to… I think you’re going to see efforts to bring along… Well, I shouldn’t go into it anymore, because that’s things I’ve been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what the next steps are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:05)', 'Speech': 'But anyway, thank you all very much. Appreciate it very much.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:38)', 'Speech': 'And so, I just asked the rhetorical question, “I wonder what we would do if that were the case?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:20)', 'Speech': 'And there’s somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages there, we think.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:17)', 'Speech': 'Anyway, we made progress.'}]"

Over the last few days we’ve worked together, and I think that’s not hyperbole. We’ve worked together to find ways to building inclusive, resilient and sustainable economies for the Asia Pacific. We talked about the progress that requires partnership. Together we laid out the work we’ll be undertaking to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The U.S. companies have announced more than $500 billion of investments into APEC economies to build new subsea cables, decarbonize energy grids, and complete the largest U.S. airline expansion into the South Pacific in our history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:37)', 'Speech': 'Alongside 13 of our APEC partners, we also made historic progress yesterday with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, with the first-of-its-kind agreements to strengthen supply chains, accelerate our clean energy transition, and combat corruption. As we begin our discussions today, I want to highlight a few areas that I believe we can do even more, in my view.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:02)', 'Speech': 'First, inclusive growth. When everyone in our economies has a chance to contribute, everyone gets a fair shot, we all do better. Today I’m proud to announce that we’ve launched a Women in the Sustainable Economy initiative. Partners in this initiative have already pledged more than $900 million to increase women’s participation in blue and green industries like forest management, clean energy, fisheries and recycling. If you wonder why I’m so enthusiastic about this, I’ve got more women in my cabinet than men, so I’ve got to get this straight.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:42)', 'Speech': 'All kidding aside, I think this is a very important initiative, including by creating the first-ever facility dedicated to helping women and women-led businesses and organizations in developing countries to gain access to climate finance. We’re also supporting programs that expand access to STEM education, to address laws that limit women’s equal access to land and natural resources, and we plan to invest in young women entrepreneurs in the maritime sector and to scale up these projects as well. I challenge us all to find new ways we can seize the full potential of all of our people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:25)', 'Speech': 'Secondly, interconnected growth and technology. We’re going to see more technological change in the next 10 years than we’ve seen in the last 50 years, and I don’t think that’s hyperbole. I think we’re going to see that changing so rapidly, and together we have to make sure it changes for the better. Matter of fact, Xi Jinping of China and I had a brief discussion about the impact of artificial intelligence and how we have to work on it. Together we must ensure the change is for the better. We must ensure that digital technologies like artificial intelligence are used to uplift, not limit the potential of our people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:05)', 'Speech': 'That’s why earlier this summer, the United States brought together leading AI companies, who agreed to voluntary commitments to keep AI systems safe and trustworthy, including the following: Committing to independently test and secure the security of their AI systems before these systems are released into the public; two, committing to watermark content that is AI-generated, so people know it’s been generated by artificial intelligence; committing to prioritize and minimize the risk that AI systems compose to society like promoting bias or discrimination.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:45)', 'Speech': 'Just last month, I signed an executive order here in the States to set new AI standards for public and private sectors in the United States, such as requiring developers of the most powerful AI systems to share their safety test results with the U.S. government … this is the U.S. … strengthen technologies to protect our privacy, and preventing employers from using AI to exploit their workers. We’re also expanding grants for AI research in key areas like healthcare and climate change. That has great potential, but this is a shared challenge and requires shared solutions. I would respectfully suggest all of us around this table have a responsibility to work together to seize the opportunities and manage the risk of this technology, which is so critical to our collective economic futures.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:41)', 'Speech': 'Finally, as I said yesterday, America’s commitment to the Asia Pacific is unwavering and, in our view from America’s perspective, essential. I know President Boluarte shares this commitment, and I want you to know next year, the APEC Summit host Peru will help drive these economies forward. We’ll be hanging out in Peru. The views are going to be nice too. As we begin our discussion, I’d like to take a moment to pass the ceremonial torch from the United States to Peru. Madam President, thank you, and the floor is yours.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:42)', 'Speech': 'We also want to encourage children and young people to be a part of this history that the leaders around this table here today share. We have worked on such an important issue, which is caring for our planet, which is the only home we have. I believe that the economies who are here today, the leaders here today, must take on this serious responsibility of continuing to work on this development and searching for a better way to care for our home, for Planet Earth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:19)', 'Speech': 'We hope to see each and every one of you in Peru next year in Arequipa, in the Sacred Valley of the Incas in Urubamba, in the beautiful Springtime City of Trujillo, to the beautiful area of the Amazon in Pucallpa, and of course in our capital, Lima, Peru. There, all of you will honor us with your presence, and we will welcome you with the affection we always show. We will work together hand in hand, all of us, so that APEC next year shines with its own light, from our Imperial City of Cusco, our beloved Peru, out towards the world. We wish you a warm welcome next year, and we will welcome you there with our greatest affection. Thank you very much, President Biden.'}]"

This deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be released. That’s our goal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:58)', 'Speech': 'This morning, I’ve been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing this deal. It’s only a start, but so far it’s gone well. Earlier this morning, 13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman, a grandmother, and mothers with their young children, some under the age of six years old.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:19)', 'Speech': 'Separately, several Italian nationals and Filipino nationals were also kidnapped by Hamas on the seventh, they were released as well. All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal, and this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them. T.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:35)', 'Speech': 'The teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the trauma these children have been through at such a very young age. Jill and I, Jill’s with me here, keeping them all in our prayers today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:50)', 'Speech': 'Today, today has been a product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement from the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I, along with my team, have worked around the clock to secure their release. We saw the first results of this effort with the release of two American hostages in late October, followed by the release of two Israeli hostages.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:11)', 'Speech': 'I’ve consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons. To accelerate and expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza. And two, to facilitate the release of hostages. And over the past several weeks, I’ve spoken repeatedly with the Emir of Qatar, the President el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to help secure this deal, to nail it down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:35)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done. I spoke with the Emir and President el-Sisi and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement. As I said, today’s release are the start of a process. We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:58)', 'Speech': 'Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families. We also remember all those who are still being held and renew our commitment to work for their release as well. Two American women and one four year old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing. We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:22)', 'Speech': 'I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:33)', 'Speech': 'This extended pause in the fighting brings a critical opportunity to deliver much needed food, medicine, water, and fuel to the civilians in Gaza, and we are not wasting one single minute.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:45)', 'Speech': 'Since my trip to Israel last month, I’ve been focused on accelerating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross. I just spoke to my special envoy for the Middle East, humanitarian issues, David Satterfield for an update, and I’ve asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and keep me personally informed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:07)', 'Speech': 'From the beginning, we put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies, and we’re continuing that effort to make sure aid gets to the people who need it. More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt into Gaza today. These trucks carry food and medicine as well as fuel and cooking gas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:30)', 'Speech': 'The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering this lifesaving supplies, but for desalinization, for water wells, for hospitals, and for bakeries. And hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter gaze over the coming days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has unleashed. Hamas doesn’t give a damn about them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:56)', 'Speech': 'We also look to the future. As we look to the future we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East. We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity. Two states for two peoples, and it’s more important now than ever.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:18)', 'Speech': 'Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace. To continue down the path of terror and violence and killing and war, is to give Hamas what they seek and we can’t do that. So today, let’s continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those who will soon be brought together again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:45)', 'Speech': 'I want to want to once again, thank the Emir of Qatar, President el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Netanyahu, for their partnership to make what we’ve done so far possible and for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:00)', 'Speech': 'Over the coming days, I’ll remain engaged with leaders throughout the Middle East as we all work together to build a better future for the region. A future where this kind of violence is unthinkable. A future where all children in the region, every child, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, grow up knowing only peace. That’s what we do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:23)', 'Speech': 'We’re waiting now just a matter of, I thought maybe even as soon as by the time I got here, but in the next hour or so, we’ll know what the second wave of releases are and I’m hopeful that as we anticipate, so thank you all for listening. I’ll take a few questions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:56)', 'Speech': 'Mr. President, what are the chances that this truce could be extended by a few days or more?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:10)', 'Speech': 'You may recall when we did the G20 a little while ago, I was able to get a resolution, a statement passed through there saying we’re going to build a railroad from Riyadh all the way through the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, Israel, et cetera, and all the way up to Europe. Not the railroad, but it’d be an underground pipeline, and then railroad.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:31)', 'Speech': 'The whole idea is there’s overwhelming interest and I think most Arab nations know it and are coordinating with one another to change the dynamic in their region for a longer term peace. And that is what I’m going to continue to work on. Thank you all very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Happy thanksgiving to you all.

I started working at this factory back in 2013. Sadly, in 2021 the factory was struggling. We had recently been through a layoff and our future was in question. When President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, this factory found new life. After being acquired by CS Wind the factory began the process of expansion, and it has provided countless members of this community with good paying jobs. Because of President Joe Biden. This factory and this community have hope again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:44)', 'Speech': 'I would like to thank CS Wind’s Chairman, Gim, who has invested so much in the community of Pueblo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I especially want to thank all the employees I’ve come to know throughout my career here at CS Wind America, whose dedication makes all of this possible. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:16)', 'Speech': 'I would also like to thank the president for his diligence in getting this law passed that supports American manufacturing jobs and is helping so many in Pueblo realize their American dream. It is with great honor and humility that I get to introduce the 46th President of the United States, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:34)', 'Speech': 'And Nick, the mayor here. I walked off … Stand up. Mr. Mayor, so I see you. I was on the plane, they came to meet me at Air Force One. I’m on the plane, I’m on the phone talking with my national security team about the next tranche of prisoners being released. And I knew I was running late so I came down the stairs of Air Force One and ran right to the car. I ran right by the mayor and everybody who came to see me. Mr. Mayor, again, I want to publicly apologize for that. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:05)', 'Speech': 'And a good friend of mine, a guy who’s been a great partner and a guy who is doing so much for this community, John Hickenlooper, thanks for being such a great partner, John. I really mean it. I said there’s one word, I was introducing John at another event, and I said there’s one word that can describe John Hickenlooper, most important word for an elected official: integrity. He’s a man of absolute total integrity. Thank you, John.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:35)', 'Speech': 'And Chairman of CS Wind, Gim, where are you? There you go, man. Thank you. We’ve had more picture taken together lately that he’s probably going to hurt his reputation back home, but I am friends with your leader, Mr. Moon, at home. We’re good guys. And I want to thank all the tribal leaders for joining. All the tribal leaders are here? If you’re here, you stand. Can I see … I don’t know where you are. Maybe I don’t … Not here right now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:08)', 'Speech': 'And to celebrate this historic investment, building a clean energy future made in America is part of the progress we’re making growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everyone does well. We’re investing in America, we’re investing in Americans, and it’s working. Since I took office my Investing in America agenda has led to manufacturing boom that’s attracted over $600 billion, $600 billion in private investment from private companies in America and around the world, manufacturing and industries of the future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:48)', 'Speech': 'When I took office, we set a goal to produce 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. And because of my commitment to a clean energy future, made-in-America clean energy companies started investing here, here in Colorado. Here in Colorado, CS Wind, a Korean company, makes towers and wind turbines. I know you all know it, but people seening this on television may not be certain. They used to make all their wind towers abroad. Then they decided to make them here in America as well. And today, CS Wind Factory in Colorado is the largest wind tower manufacturer in the entire world, in the entire world, with over 870 employees.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:32)', 'Speech': 'It’s simple. As I’ve said for a long time, when I think climate, and I mean this sincerely, I think jobs, jobs, that’s what climate’s about. Not only saving lives and saving the environment, but jobs. But that’s not the end of the story. I signed a historic law, the most significant investment combating existential threat of climate change ever anywhere in the world. It does many things, including providing incentives to make wind towers in America, and bonuses for clean energy projects that use those American-made wind towers to power American homes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:08)', 'Speech': 'And because of my Investment in America agenda, CS Wind plans to invest in an additional $200 million to expand the facility right here, another $200 million. Doubling its production and creating 850 more good jobs beyond what’s going on. And because of the investment and incentives we wrote into the law, CS Wind recently announced its employees will receive an end-of-year bonuses as well. You can clap for that, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:49)', 'Speech': 'It matters. Like I said, when I hear climate, I think jobs. Here in Colorado, the wind turbine manufacturing Vestas is investing $40 million to expand its factory and hiring additional 1,000 employees. Solar manufacturer Meyer Burger is building a new solar cell factory just down the road in Colorado Springs. They’ll create more than 350 new jobs themselves. And all across America, instead of exporting jobs, companies both foreign and domestic are creating jobs here in America and exporting American-made products.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:34)', 'Speech': 'That’s we used to do 40 years ago. Through my bipartisan infrastructure law we’re also making the most substantial investment in American infrastructure since President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System. We’re investing in roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, affordable high-speed internet. Already we’ve announced over 40,000 projects, 4,500 communities across the nation are benefiting. And from the new Amtrak tunnel in Baltimore to the Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky to right here in Colorado, $5.6 billion and 304 projects. We’re investing $160 million on a 103-mile water pipeline known as the Arkansas Valley Conduit. It starts here in Pueblo. It’ll bring water to 50,000 people across the Southeastern Colorado.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:30)', 'Speech': 'And that’s not all, we haven’t forgotten tribal lands here in Colorado. We’re investing over $66 million in tribal lands here to ensure underserved Native American communities have access to affordable high-speed internet. The amazing thing is, over 233,000 Colorado households already have a savings of $30 a month on their internet bills because of the Affordable Connectivity Program. And as part of my commitment to conserve and restore our country’s lands and waters, my administration’s already conserved more than 21 million acres nationwide, including when I was here a year ago at the Camp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument. A beautiful place that will never, ever, ever be built on in the future generations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:23)', 'Speech': 'We’re also bringing the semiconductor manufacturing back home. We invented the computer chip, we invented the semiconductor. All those computer chips smaller than the tip of your finger that effect nearly everything in our lives, from cell phones to automobiles to refrigerators to advanced weapon systems, American invented these chips. But as time went on, we went from producing 40% of the world’s chips down to just over 10%. That’s why I designed and signed the CHIPS and Science Act because how can we remain the greatest nation of the world without leading the world in science and technology? How does that happen? We used to invest 2% of our gross domestic product in research and development as a nation. That’s why we’re leading the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:09)', 'Speech': 'Over time that went down to 0.7%, but we’re changing that. Now all over the country semiconductor companies are investing literally hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home to America. In Colorado Springs, the company Microchip announced it would invest $880 million to expand their manufacturing capacity, creating 400 additional good paying jobs in the semiconductor industry. And the fabs, they call the factories they’re built in, these fabs, they pay an annual salary over $100,000 a year. And guess what? You don’t need a college degree to get the job. Folks, things are changing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:56)', 'Speech': 'We’re also focused on growing the rural economy. Let me put this in perspective for you. Just four big corporations control more than half of the markets in beef, pork and poultry in all of America. And because so few companies control so much in the market, if one of those processing plants goes offline it can have a massive impact on the supply chain disruptions, slowing production, and costs farmers real big. Under my administration Colorado will receive millions of dollars to strengthen and expand access to small, mid-size meat and poultry processors.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:32)', 'Speech': 'The big guys don’t like it, but guess what? You have a guaranteed access. Having facilities close by means farmers and ranchers have a better shot at getting a fair price for their product. We’re also helping farmers and ranchers deploy clean energy systems like solar panels on their farms and ranches, lowering energy costs and increasing their incomes. When farmers and ranchers do well, when the wealth they generate stays in Colorado, when their children can stay in Colorado, it builds a stronger rural economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:11)', 'Speech': 'Now, new data released to just today shows the investments we’re making have spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act, which I wrote, which we passed, is going to communities historically left behind. Since I signed the law, 99% of clean energy investments in Colorado are in counties with average incomes below average, below medium household incomes. When I took office, I vowed I’d be president for all Americans, whether you live in a blue state or a red state, whether you live in rural or urban areas, and we’re delivering on that promise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:50)', 'Speech': 'But folks, we haven’t gotten a whole lot of help from some members of Congress, on the other side of the aisle in the United States Congress. The historic investments we’re celebrating today is in Congresswoman Boebert’s district. She’s one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement. She, along with every single Republican colleague, voted against the law that made these investments in jobs possible. And that’s not a hyperbole, that’s a fact. And then she voted to repeal key parts of this law and she called this law a massive failure.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:33)', 'Speech': 'You all know you’re part of a massive failure? Tell that to the 850 Coloradans who are getting new jobs in Pueblo in CS Wind thanks to this law. Tell that to the local economy that’s going to benefit from these investments. Tell that to anyone who wants to listen. Tell thanks to Congresswoman. I think what she calls a massive failure, a solar power company that’s investing $400 million here in Colorado for 56,000 homes, create 250 good paying jobs. Lightsource bp is building a new solar farm just down the road from here to power an additional 53,000 homes. Across Colorado Xcel Energy is investing $1.7 billion to improve the state’s electric grid.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:22)', 'Speech': 'And folks, none of that sounds like a massive failure to me. How about you? I mean, it’s crazy. This is an incredible opportunity. I’ve gone around the plant today [inaudible 00:15:40] those who I got to talk to, “You’re changing America. You’re changing America.” It all sounds like a massive failure in thinking by the congresswoman and her colleague. The congresswoman also voted against the CHIPS and Science Act, and when she voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law she called it “garbage,” a “scam.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:05)', 'Speech': 'And as a matter of fact, the new Republican speaker of the House, along with the Republican Congressman Verne Buchanan, just visited Sarasota, Florida, yesterday to tour the construction of a new terminal at that airport. It’s going to create thousands of jobs over time. The project is funded, funded with nearly $30 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it’s going to generate more than $30 million for Florida multiple times over. And guess what? Both the Speaker and the congressman voted against the law and spoke against the law, but now they’re down there taking credit for it being built. As my mother would say, “God love them.” As one of my friends back home would say, “That’s real chutzpah.” That’s real chutzpah.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:53)', 'Speech': 'Meanwhile, my predecessor wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Over 40 million Americans today get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. His plan is to throw them off that plan. That would mean the number of uninsured African Americans will go up by 20%, for Latinos it will go up by 15%. Folks, this is not your father’s Republican Party. Like I said, I made a promise to be the president for every American, and I’m keeping my promise. And just this morning we learned that our economy, our economy, just this new data out, our economy grew by over 5% in the last quarter.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:39)', 'Speech': 'That’s more than it grew under my predecessor in any quarter outside the pandemic, despite promises of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations would be what they said would supercharge the economy and trickle down to working folks. Not a whole lot trickle down to most kitchen tables I’m aware of but when I took office, since then, in the first two years, we created over 14 million brand new jobs, good paying jobs. And nearly 250,000 of those good paying jobs are here in Colorado alone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:18)', 'Speech': 'Remember, we were told we’re not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world. Well, how can we be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Well, we’ve created close to 800,000 manufacturing jobs, almost twice as many as the previous administration did in all four years. The unemployment rate has stayed below 4% for over 20 months in a row, the longest stretch in 50 years. And we’ve seen the highest share of working age Americans in the workforce in 20 years. And inflation is down. We have more work to do, but inflation’s down at the same time. Core inflation is the lowest level in two years that we’ve had, the lowest inflation of any major country in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:55)', 'Speech': 'Let me be clear, any corporation that’s not passing these savings on to the consumers needs to stop the price gouging. And as my friend Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania calls it, “greedflation.” American people are tired of being played for suckers. Look at all the hidden fees you have. You call up your bank and you want to find out what the balance in your account is, they charge you 20 bucks. I can go on and on and on. It’s wrong. One thing I said after we passed all these major pieces of legislation, so the next big battle’s going to be whether the very wealthiest among us, the biggest corporation, begin to start paying their fair share. I’m not talking about 80%, 70%, 90. I’m talking about the highest tax rate in America is 36%.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:48)', 'Speech': 'Let me be clear. The speaker, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans here in Congress, committed to protecting their outrageous tax cuts for those at the very top. And they’re going to continue to oppose investing in all those programs that help people, whether it’s in education, healthcare, whatever. I have a different view. One of the ways that we paid for all those investments and we paid for them … And by the way, I cut the federal deficit by over $7 billion while doing all this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:19)', 'Speech': 'But one of the ways we paid for these investments is by making corporations begin to pay their fair share. Some of you may remember all the publicity back in 2020. 55 of the Fortune 500 companies in America made $40 billion in profits. That’s good. You know what they paid in federal taxes? Zero. Not a penny. Not one penny. Because of the law I signed, the billion-dollar corporations now have to pay a minimum of 15% of federal tax. That’s even less than you all pay, but they’re paying zero before. That paid for all the work we did and we have more work to do. Does anyone think the tax code’s fair? If you do, raise your hand. I’m not joking. Even people doing well, don’t think it’s fair.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:11)', 'Speech': 'We had about 750 billionaires in America before the pandemic. Now there are 1,000. The average rate those billionaires pay in their federal taxes? 8%. They make a billion dollars and they pay 8%. Raise your hand if you pay more than 8%. Every one of you do. I’m serious, think about this. I mean, just think about it. That’s less than a firefighter or a teacher or so many other people pay. That’s why I’m proposing a billionaire minimum tax. Get this, a billionaire minimum tax, not even at the highest rate of 25%, which was a lot of you pay if you’re a family of four making 150,000 bucks a year. Just 25% is still 10% lower than the top rate and it would raise $440 billion over the next 10 years, just paying 25% instead of eight.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:17)', 'Speech': 'Imagine what we could do if we just made these billionaires pay their taxes like everyone else. We could use it to strengthen the Social Security and Medicare system, instead of cutting them like Congressman Trump and Boebert want to to do. We could use it to help millionaires and millions of families afford, instead of the millionaires, and millions of families afford a little help with senior care. How many of you have a mom or dad that they don’t want to have to give up all the value in their home, sell it and go to a nursing home? But if they just had someone there at dinnertime to help them with the dinner or just had them in the morning there, just a little bit, they could stay, save a lot of money, and be a hell of a lot happier.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:05)', 'Speech': 'Or what could we do with childcare? We had that childcare tax cut. What happened? We had the lowest poverty rate for children in the history of America. But what it does, it generates income. All those moms and single dads who are taking care of their kids, they’re able to get a job, pay a tax, go to work, because someone can be with their child. Childcare. This is not about help of poor folks, it’s about smart economics. If we had another five million women working who can’t work now it generates economic income and growth in their communities. All these ideas would be a hell of a lot better for growing the American economy than letting billionaires keep paying less taxes than any working person in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:59)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. My plan is based on the belief that every American willing to work hard, and some don’t want to work hard, but every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job no matter where they live. In the heartland or in a small town, to raise kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up. My dad, and it’s the God’s truth, I know, I apologize to Hickenloop and others, Herby say it a thousand times, my dad used to say it and I said, I’m deadly earnest, he’d say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about being treated with respect. It’s about being to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:50)', 'Speech': 'There are a quarter of a million more jobs in Colorado since I took office. That’s a quarter of a million more people throughout this state, including in this district, who can look their kids in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” They call it socialism. My plan is rooted in what we’ve always worked best for this country, investing in America, investing in Americans, because when we invest in our people, when we strengthen the middle class, we see stronger economic growth for all Americans. Not just the middle. Everybody grows, for real.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:30)', 'Speech': 'Here’s the deal. I’ve said this and I’ve said this to Den Xiaoping in the Himalayas I’ve said this to every world leader, it’s never, never, never been a good bet to bet against American people. Never, never, never. And I can honestly say, I mean this from the bottom of my heart, I can honestly say, I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today. We just have remember who in God’s name we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. So let’s continue to work together and God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We’re moving, folks. We are moving and no one’s going to stop us. Thank you.'}]"

Love that endures 60 years after his death, tragically. Anniversary was marked last month. The anniversary just came as we said goodbye to someone who I admired greatly, the First Lady, Rosalyn Carter, who was also a champion of the performing arts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:06)', 'Speech': 'It’s simple as it is profound. The performing arts are more than just sound and seeing. They reflect who we are as Americans and as human beings. That’s especially true for more than 200 Kennedy Center Honorees over the past 46 years who have helped shape how we see ourselves, how we see each other, and how we see our world. Honor is not just based on the length of the career or the scope of the work or the height of the fame, but because of their unique place and the conscience and the very soul of our dynamic and diverse nation. You’re an incredible group. You really are. This year’s class continues that legacy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:47)', 'Speech': 'In New York City, you can walk a few blocks and you can circle the earth just a few blocks. 8 million people of every background and the most alive city probably in America. And that’s just one guy who makes everyone stop and laugh, Billy Crystal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:05)', 'Speech': 'Now, Billy grew up sweeping the floor of his family’s music shop on 42nd Street and he became America’s most celebrated comedians, actor, and writer on screen, on stage. And he played every form, in everyone’s form, The Miracle Man and The Princess Bride. The one that really fascinated me was a therapist for a mobster. And City Slicker, which I told him I just looked at again today. A Guy Who Met Sally, nine time Oscar most second only to Bob Hope and previous Kennedy Senator Honorees, and six Emmy Awards. Tony Winner, bestselling author, and by what I admire most about him is his heart.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:03)', 'Speech': 'His heart reminds us that love and care for one another. Raising awareness and funds to end cancer, fighting homelessness, help a city rebuild after 9/11 and Super Storm Sandy and so much more. Maybe the most helpful of all, helping people find the light of laughter and purpose from the kindness and the darkness that occurs as a consequence of loss and pain. Billy’s award-winning Broadway show is about 700 Sundays he had with his dad before his dad passed away when Billy was only 15 years old.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:38)', 'Speech': 'It captured the love they shared at the time and the time they had together. And the love of his mother, his brother, his uncle, and other pieces of his soul gone too soon. By sharing that love so openly, Billy has helped countless people hold on to the loves of their lone lives. That’s Billy Crystal, the American showman with a heart of gold, Billy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:16)', 'Speech': 'He promised me he’s not going to primary me. He could win. Holiday season has arrived and we hear our favorite holiday songs tonight. Tonight we celebrate someone who brings joy to the world with her extraordinary voice. Renee Fleming, one of the greatest opera sopranos of all time. The scripting of our voice verge on the mystical, characterized as pure gold. Jewels floating like butterflies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:56)', 'Speech': 'With her heavenly voice, Renee has risen from humble roots in upstate New York to the heights of the opera world and well, well beyond. Performing more than 50 of the greatest soprano roles on the world’s most prestigious world stages. She sings in six languages, over 2 million records sold, five Grammys and takes opera outside the grand halls of the world. The first opera singer to perform at the Super Bowl. Her voice was heard in the Lord of the Rings movies, and she sang in late show with David Letterman. And with a cast of Sesame Street, both fellow Kennedy Honorees. More personally, her rendition of Danny Boy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:40)', 'Speech': 'At the funeral, my friend John McCain moved us deeply on a cold January day in 2009. She performed as Barack and I were first inaugurated. I’ll never forget it. On another cold day in January 2021 before another inauguration, she performed in a private mass for Jill and me, Kamala, and Doug and our families. We sat in odd silence listening to a rendition of America the Beautiful. I felt like a choir of angels singing. That’s Renee Fleming. Renee.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:28)', 'Speech': 'As a child in Australia and England, Barry Gibb finally made it to the United States, thanks God. He and his brothers set their sights on one thing to make it big, to make it big. Kids being kids, they made guitars out of cheese boxes, lip sync their favorite songs and performed on the street corners. Not even 10 years old when he first performed on stage together, they discovered early on the natural gift, the natural gift of singing in three-part harmony. It was the start of what would become one of the longest running top-selling musical acts in history, the Bee Gees. And I’m a fan.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:13)', 'Speech': 'From those soulful hits in the ’60s, I was a mere child. To fueling the explosion of disco in the 1970s, the Bee Gees defied genres and left an enduring mark upon pop music. Over the course of four decades, their trademark, falsettos and prolific songwriting have sold over 220 million albums and created a hundred… Excuse me, created 1,000 songs, including songs for another superstar’s performance.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:52)', 'Speech': 'The Bee Gees earned nine number one hits nearly 30 top 40 hits, five Grammys, nine nominations. And while I know when you think of the Bee Gees, it’s an infectious beat that you hear in your own mind, but I think it’s universal. It’s simple, simple human truths that their lyrics contained, so often captured and grip our hearts.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:15)', 'Speech': 'Lyrics like there’s a certain kind of light that never shone on me from those hopelessly in love, or I’ve kicked around since I was born about the Bay Ridge 19-year-old struck by a dead-end job who’s trying to stay alive. The list goes on. The brothers bound made it all seem effortless and almost magical. They described it as, “We’ll be walking down the street together and we’ll simultaneously begin to sing the same song and the same key.” God love you, Billy. I tell you that’s incredible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:50)', 'Speech': 'Proof, proof that all they may have accomplished as Bee Gees looked at the world like so many of us do in a simple straight way, how am I affected by it? Family is the beginning, the middle, and end. So while honor goes to Barry, and we know he accepts it in harmony with Robin, Morris, Andy, and the brothers Gibbs. Barry, I think you made it big. No question.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:38)', 'Speech': '50 years ago, August of ’73, the Bronx, a new art form was born inspired by spirituals sang as prayers of freedom. Gospel music heard in churches, jazz played at speakeasies, funk music and nightclubs, continuing the long tradition of Black performers using their art to break down barriers and to give voice to the promise of American for all Americans, for all Americans. Over the past 50 years, hip-hop has become as unstoppable force in America, and not just America, but around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:12)', 'Speech': 'Before I traveled from the Bronx to change the culture forever before they did, it caught the ear of a child from Newark, New Jersey. She’d grown up practicing with friends at school and then learning from legends and nightclubs. It didn’t take long for Dana Owens to know, become known as Queen Latifah. Queen Latifah.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:43)', 'Speech': 'A natural storyteller, a natural storyteller. She released her first album at age 19. In the studio, she rapped about everything from the pain of losing her brother to the abuse of power, the respect that Black women deserve, and how infinite love is the only hope for unity. Grammy winner, 2 million albums sold, 2 million albums sold. She’s also a skillful storyteller on screen. The first woman in hip-hop to earn an Oscar nomination, which she did for her role in Chicago. And by the way, with other movies and movies, she’s earned a Golden Globe and a Primetime enemy, enemy. That’s me. Primetime Emmy. She’s also the first hip-hop artist with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That’s a full trophy case, if I say.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:43)', 'Speech': 'But as a point of privilege, personal privilege, I’d like to thank… There’s a second place for an honorary degree that she received in 2011 from Delaware State University, my HBCU.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:56)', 'Speech': 'Kamala and I have an ongoing running debate about whether it’s Howard or Delaware State, the best HBCU in the nation. From serving as a mentor for young women of color to building housing in her hometown in Newark, she displays how storytelling and service go hand in hand. Tonight, Queen Latifah, you become the first female hip-hop artist to receive a Kennedy Honor lifting and fitting because it is a tribute to 50-year anniversary of hip-hop proving that anything is possible when we discover our own voice, write our own story, and share it with the world. And that’s what you’ve done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:01)', 'Speech': 'Scripture tells us God gives us each gifts, and thank the Lord God gave the gift to us of Dionne Warwick. A few nights ago, she performed at the lighting of the national Christmas tree, just outside the White House. As expected, she was incredible. Just as she’s been from the very beginning. As a 6-year-old, she climbed to the top of a stack of books in the pulpit of her grandfather’s church in New Jersey. She sang for the congregation finding her gift and her calling that now spans seven decades.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:42)', 'Speech': 'Iconic melodies, verses, and albums, love songs, and anthems. It includes I Say a Little Prayer, Do You Know the Way to San Jose? Five Grammys, 14 nominations of Grammy Hall of Fame, R&B Music Hall of Fame. Over 100 million sold, 100 million records sold and counting. But what makes her truly exceptional in my view, is how her friend and great humanitarian, the incomparable artist, the previous Kennedy Center Honoree, Stevie Wonder, described her. He said, “You cannot separate the voice from the heart. You cannot separate the voice from the heart.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:28)', 'Speech': 'For example, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic raged in the ’80s, she asked fellow artists to create music to help save lives and break stigmas. That group included Stevie, Elton John, and Gladys Knight, also a previous Kennedy Center Honoree. That legend recorded… They’re just incredible what they’ve done. And what they did, they recorded, That’s What Friends Are For, and they were surely a good bunch of friends. A song that reached the top of the charts and raised millions of dollars to fight that deadly epidemic. Her voice and heart make us feel something deep within ourselves. That’s Dionne Warwick, truly a gift to all of us, Dionne.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:00)', 'Speech': 'And that’s all been introduced by a guy who couldn’t carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the 2023 Kennedy Center Honorees. Congratulations to your families and friends, and thank you all for supporting the performing arts that shape our conscience and the very soul of the nation. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}]"

But I was going home to see my mom. I was catching a 5:00 train. I used to take every single day a 7:00 train out of Washington. I lived 150 miles from Washington and I took the train every single day because my wife and daughter… I started going home to see my… Anyway, make a long story not so quite so long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:44)', 'Speech': 'I was getting on the train and one of the senior guys in Amtrak, I became friends with all of them after all the years and I’ve ridden 36 years as a senator.

And before I get started though, I should say a few words about the terrible incident that’s happened and all my colleagues have recently spoke to. First of all, two state Nevada troopers killed on the line of duty. They were helping a driver on the side of a freeway. And when they were killed by hit-and-run driver. And two days later, a gunman opened fire at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Three people killed a fourth now and hospitalized.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:18)', 'Speech': 'I’m grateful the law enforcement officer risk their lives in the safety of shooting and spree.

We need to ban assault weapons of high capacity magazines, pass national red flag laws, as you’ve done here that require safe storage, enact universal background checks, other commonsense measures to save lives. Because the Second Amendment didn’t say you can own any gun, you can own any weapon. You couldn’t own a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed. Anyway, don’t get me started.

Their relentless work for the people in Nevada brought this historic project home to your great state. I also want to thank our partners from the private sector. Wes and the whole team at Brightline for supporting this project. It’s a big deal. Where are you? There he is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:34)', 'Speech': 'And I mean, big deal. It’s a lot of money, a lot of involved. My investing in America agenda has now surpassed over attracting $628 billion in private investment from all over the world of manufacturing clean energy here at home just since we took office about two and a half, three years ago. What’s happened here in Nevada is another great example. A special thanks to my friend, governor Sisolak. I don’t know where the gov is, but he knew me. He had to hear me talk about this for a long time back when he was governor.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:15)', 'Speech': 'And finally, I want to thank a special member of my team, Mitch Landrieu. Now, Mitch was from N’awlins. That’s New Orleans in English. And he used to be the mayor. His dad was the mayor. He knows what he’s doing. He’s been leading the charge to implement this bipartisan infrastructure law. We actually got surprise. We got about 36 Republicans to vote for it. That’s real. So, thanks, Mitch.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:47)', 'Speech': 'Nearly every day for 36 years as senator, I told you I took that train back and forth to Washington. 300-mile round trip. Took four hours sum total from the time I left the house and got back to the house each way. I did it for my family, but I came to see how train and travel opens an enormous possibility for the nation. Rail connections, it connects jobs and opportunities for people. It gets goods to market, traffic off the street, travelers on the move.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:16)', 'Speech': 'Railroads made America a force in commerce and innovation in the world uniting the country, building the most powerful economy ever in history of the world. And over time though we fell behind. Our infrastructure used to be the best in the world. When I took office, we were ranked 13 in the world in our infrastructure. Roads, bridges, et cetera. Now, we’re turning around in a big way.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:40)', 'Speech': 'We’re in an economic competition for the 21st century. By the way, China has had trains going 220 miles an hour for a while now. 220 miles an hour for a while now. Look, we have the best economy. How can you be the best economy in the world without having the best infrastructure in the world? And we’re going to do that. That’s why I’m here to talk about an ambitious vision for America to be fully within our reach. And I really believe it is. When I ran for president, I made a commitment to build a world-class, high-speed rail worthy of the United States of America, worthy of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:17)', 'Speech': 'I mean it. Put our nation back on track for the fastest, safest, and greenest railways in the world. And finally to bring high-speed rail to our nation. Today, I’m here to deliver on that vision. You have no idea how much this pleases me. At long last, we’re building the first high-speed rail project in our nation’s history, and it started here.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:40)', 'Speech': 'It’s part of $8.2 billion investment we’re making in 10 major rail projects across America, reaching tens of millions of people. We’re putting high-speed rail on the fast track. Together we’re finally going to make high-speed rail happen between Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Folks, we’ve been talking about this project for decades. Now we’re really getting it done. I want to thank the members of the Nevada’s Congressional delegation for all they’ve done to make it possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:12)', 'Speech': 'And here’s why it matters. Some of you know what it’s like to sit in traffic on interstates, not the one between here and LA, which is real, but all interstates. And guess what? Trying to make it that drive from LA to Las Vegas, or Las Vegas to LA or anywhere in between is pain in the neck. It could take up to seven hours. But soon it’s not going to be anymore. We’re investing $3 billion on this rail line so folks can make that trip in over just over two hours, two hours.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:46)', 'Speech': '186 miles an hour. And it won’t just get there faster. The rail project reduces carbon emissions by taking three… It’s the same as taking 3 million vehicles off the highway. 3 million. And all the studies show by the way, people get from point A to point B faster on a train than their car they take the train. They take the train. Think of what that’s going to mean to the environment. Think of what it’ll mean for the local economy. New rail line will transport 11 million passengers a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:21)', 'Speech': 'That means more visitors, more business, more Las Vegas, more money. And if the casino worker wants to take their kid to California for the weekend, they can have breakfast here in Las Vegas and lunch in LA. Look folks, what it really means, it means growth, it means opportunity for towns and communities between here and the California coast. It’s on track to be completed by the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Guess where they’re going to come and visit?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:55)', 'Speech': 'It means with high-speed rail, Las Vegas can host some of the hundreds of thousands of visitors and athletes who are expecting from around the world. And here’s the best part. It means jobs, union jobs, jobs, job jobs. I’m a big environmentalist. Why am I always talking about the environment? When I think environment, I think jobs. 35,000 jobs during construction phase 10,000 union jobs in the building trades.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:31)', 'Speech': 'Carpenters, electricians, iron workers, laborers, and more. Jobs and jobs beyond. In fact, once we complete this train line, it’s going to be operated by union workers. That means a thousand. That means a thousand new jobs for tracking signal workers, onboard workers, shop craft workers, everyone. Everyone who works on the rail. And for those good paying jobs, they don’t require a college degree, but you got to work just as hard to get one, man. Union workers are the most highly trained, skilled workers. This is not a joke. You’re the most highly skilled workers in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:10)', 'Speech': 'I’m not just saying it. But you guys don’t talk enough about. It’s like going to college. You got to be an apprentice for four to five years. You can’t walk up and say, “I want to be a carpenter.” You got to go to school to be a carpenter and you got to do it here, the long term. I had the Treasury Department do a study. The cost is more efficient to hire a union worker because you do the best jobs, the best results and the last, the longest and long run, you’re cheaper for the employer than if you weren’t a union worker.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:46)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I always say… Look, folks, I say this all the time. Wall Street did not build America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class. That’s the truth. That’s true. There would be no middle class without unions. That’s a fact. And by the way, I know I’m going to look like I’m 41, but I’m not new to this. You guys don’t even realize how important you are. You built the middle class. It would never have occurred without union wages.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:33)', 'Speech': 'Another high-speed rail project we’re announcing today is in California. Ultimately, it’s going to take folks in Los Angeles through the Central Valley all the way to San Francisco, but less than three hours. But today, the journey can take eight hours by bus or car. Think of how this train will transform California’s Central Valley with new businesses, new residents, visitors, economic opportunities or what it will mean to folks who live in inland towns and commute to work and California and coastal cities. It’s a game changer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:05)', 'Speech': 'I mean, we make these speeches, but I mean every single word I’m saying literally. To put all this in perspective, this project in California is the most ambitious rail project in the entire Western hemisphere. It expects to carry 31 million passengers a year, will be 100% powered by renewable energy. And once again, this project is about jobs. It’s already created 12,000 good paying union construction jobs with thousands more to come.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:34)', 'Speech': 'Many of us have pushed for this high-speed rail project in California for a long time. In fact, the very first federal dollars that went out, came from Recovery Act which was a change… Which I was in charge of as vice president to help us recover from the great recession of 2009. The last administration tried to cancel. Now, I promise you, once it’s built, they’re going to be… No, they’re going to be claiming credit for it. Remember I said it. Remember I said it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:04)', 'Speech': 'But they failed. I want to thank two people who couldn’t be here today who made the California project possible. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, most effective speaker in the House of American history. She has relentlessly pushed for high-speed rail in California. She knows how critical it is to people’s lives and of the strength of the economy across California and across the country. No one has done more to make it a reality. And Governor Gavin Newsom, a tremendous governor who never gave up the fight to get this done. And folks we’re not stopping now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:44)', 'Speech': 'I know we’re here about this project, but these projects are joined by others across the country. I made sure we had just not these two. North Carolina, Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, improving rail service in Montana, Maine, New Hampshire, all the way to the Alaskan Railroad. We’re supporting 69 rail projects still in the early stages across 44 states. On top of that, we’re investing $9 billion to replace over 1,000 Amtrak engines and cars across the country with state-of-the-art equipment made in America by American workers. Made in America by American workers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:23)', 'Speech': 'And add it all up, we’re making the biggest investment in history for passenger rail since literally the creation of Amtrak half a century ago. All told thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure. Over 40,000 infrastructure projects are announced across America. Not just railroads, but bridges, roads, ports, airports, clean water system, affordable high-speed internet. Thanks to your congressional delegation here in Nevada, we’ve delivered $3.2 billion. Nearly 200 of these projects already here in this state.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:03)', 'Speech': 'Over 400 million in affordable, high-speed internet statewide. We’re helping school districts across the country, including Clark County. Electric school buses can keep kids with child asthma more healthy. Diesel exhaust from school buses pollute the air that these kids breathe. We’re installing sidewalks, streetlights, bike lanes along Stewart Avenue here in Las Vegas and the major roadways connecting downtown in East Las Vegas. The list goes on. We’re going to change the way people are able to live.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:42)', 'Speech': 'Folks, all this project stands in stark contrast to my predecessor. He always talked about infrastructure week. Four years of infrastructure week, but it failed. He failed. On my watch, instead of Infrastructure Week, America is having Infrastructure Decade, decade. Over $1,000,300,000,000. Trump just talks the talk. We walk the walk. Look, he likes to say America’s a fairly nation. Frankly, he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about. I see shovel in the ground. Cranes in the sky, people hard at work rebuilding America together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:32)', 'Speech': 'Meanwhile, the vast majority of our Republican friends in Congress voted against infrastructure law. But that doesn’t stop them from calling up now and saying, “Hey, Mr. President, we need a project in my district.” Well, that’s okay. I promised I’d be president for every American. And like I said before, I’ll see them at the groundbreaking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:52)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I shouldn’t be so flip, but I made a commitment and this is God’s truth. I made a commitment to build this country to stop the trickle-down economics. My dad was a hardworking guy, busted his neck. Not a whole lot trickle down on our kitchen table. Not a whole lot trickle down. My dad used to say, “Job is worth a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:26)', 'Speech': 'Well, I decided we’re going to build economy a different way. Not a joke. Back when it really was burgeoning after the 30s to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up. That way the poor have a shot. The middle class do well and the wealthy still do well. Matter of fact, they should be paying a hell of a lot more taxes. That’s another issue. But to invest in ourselves again in all America, all Americans. They started off making fun of it called the Bidenomics. Well, guess what? It is Bidenomics. We have a lot more to do to put our plan that’s already paying off. This morning we learned that the economy added 199,000 jobs again this month. Solid, steady job growth.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:10)', 'Speech': 'Like that as we call a sweet spot that’s needed for stable growth and lower inflation, not encouraging the Fed to raise interest rates. All told we’ve created 14 million jobs since he took office more than any president has created in all four years of return. Wages are up more than inflation. The economy grew by 5% this last quarter. Today, the supply chains are strong, but we have more to do to bring down inflation beyond the two thirds we brought it down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:42)', 'Speech': 'America has had the strongest growth and now has the lowest inflation of any major economy in the world. But there’s more to do. We know the prices are still too high for too many things. That’s why I’m fighting to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Guess what? Insulin, 400 bucks a month for people. Guess what it is now? 35 bucks. 35 bucks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:05)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, by 2025, no matter what, no matter what year your prescription drug costs are, and some cancer drugs, there’s four or five, 10, as much as $13,000. Nobody as a senior will have to pay more than $2,000 a month, period, period. Bringing down health insurance and utility bills. That’s why I’m fighting to eliminate the hidden junk fees that banks and airlines, and other companies do to rip off consumers. Look, do you ever think when you pick up the phone and call on what your balance in your account is, you’re going to get charged 20 bucks or you get in an airline, you want your kid sitting next to you, they’ll tell you it’s going to cost you another 300 bucks?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:52)', 'Speech': 'I mean, this is ridiculous. Let me be clear. Now that we’ve built the supply chains and brought down cost, any corporation that is not passing on these savings along to consumers needs to stop this price gouging. The American people are tired of being played for suckers. And by the way, does anyone here think that the tax code is fair? If you do, raise your hand.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:16)', 'Speech': 'You got it, baby. I made a commitment that nobody making less than 400,000 bucks a year, which is way above what I ever made until I became president. Look, in 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations of America, Fortune 500, they paid zero in federal taxes and they made $40 billion. 40 billion in profit. But not anymore. Under the law I got passed and signed, big corporations now have to pay less than you pay. I could only get it up to 15%. But guess what? That paid for all the programs we’re talking about. And probably less than what… As I said, we have to do more though.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:04)', 'Speech': 'Get this, we used to have… Before the pandemic, we had in the United States of America, 750 billionaires. Guess what we have now? We have 1,000 billionaires. You know what their average tax rate is in the federal government? 8%. 8%. That’s why I’m proposing a billionaire minimum tax of 25%. 25. The billionaires, the big corporations paid their fair share to strengthen social security and Medicare. We wouldn’t have all this talk from the other team talking about having to cut it. We could bring down the cost of childcare, elder care for working class and middle class people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:45)', 'Speech': 'Look, when we do that, the poor have a ladder up, as I said, the middle class does very well, and the wealthy still do well. We all do well. Let me close at this. When we see shovels in the ground and people hard at work on these projects, I hope you feel something that really matters. At least where I come from in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware, used to be a big steel town. Pride, pride in America, pride in knowing we can get big things done when we work together. You’re all the real heroes of this story. We talk about what I did and others did. The American people, the American workers, neighbors, and leaders in the community doing the work to bring your city into the future, that’s what America does.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:31)', 'Speech': 'That’s why it’s never been a good bet. As I told Xi Jinping, it’s never been a good bet to bet against America. Never, never, never, never. And I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. Just to remember, who in God’s name we are. We’re the United States of America and there’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing, nothing, nothing. We’ve always come out… Check it out, stronger than we went in every time when we work together. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Let’s get this done.'}]"
https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/biden-marks-jan-6-anniversary-with-campaign-speech-on-democracy-transcript,2024-01-08,Biden Marks Jan. 6 Anniversary with Speech on Democracy,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:09)', 'Speech': 'Today I am reminded of how I experienced the events of January 6th, three years ago. It was a day that fundamentally changed my perspective on our country as an American, as a husband, as a father, and as a pastor. On January 10th, I told my church community during my sermon that the violence that day does not represent the fellowship and faith that we seek to embody. For the first time, my wife and I discussed what we would do if our country became destabilized. How would we protect our three children? I’ve always been engaged politically as an advocate and activist for communities that are often overlooked and underserved. Yet this moment, this insurrection, provided the need for deeper engagement. Earlier this year, when Run for Something, an organization that recruits and supports young candidates, reached out and asked if I would consider running for office, a big part of my decision was the reality that county commissioners have a role in overseeing elections. Free, fair, and accessible elections are the bedrock of our democracy. Donald Trump represents a clear and present danger to that democracy. His lies about the election, encouraging his supporters to violently stop the peaceful transfer of power, make him unfit to be president. I’m proud to be here today supporting a president who has been strong and unequivocal in his defending American democracy. A president whose leadership is exactly what we need in this moment. It is my honor to welcome to the stage the President of the United States, Joe Biden, and the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:41)', 'Speech': 'This army that lacked blankets and food, clothes and shoes. This army whose march left bloody bare footprints of the snow, this ragtag army made up of ordinary people, their mission, George Washington declared was nothing less than a sacred cause. That was the phrase he used. A sacred cause. Freedom, liberty, democracy, American democracy. I just visited the grounds of Valley Forge. I’ve been there a number of times from the time I was a boy scout years ago.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:17)', 'Speech': 'It’s the very site that I think every American should visit because it tells a story of the pain and the suffering and the true patriotism it took to make America. Today, we gather in a new year, some 246 years later. Just one day before January 6th, a date forever shared in our memory because it was on that day that we nearly lost America. Lost it all. Today, we’re here to answer the most important of questions. Is democracy still America’s sacred cause? I mean it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:04)', 'Speech': 'This is not rhetorical, academic or hypothetical, but that democracy is still America’s sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it’s what the 2024 election is all about. The choice is clear. Donald Trump’s campaign is about him. Not America, not you. Donald Trump’s campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He’s willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power. Our campaign is different. For me and Kamala, our campaign is about America. It’s about you. It’s about every age and background that occupy this country. It’s about the future we’re going to continue to build together. And our campaign is about preserving and strengthening our American democracy. Three years ago tomorrow we saw with our own eyes, the violent mob storm the United States Capitol. It was almost in disbelief as you first turned on the television.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:09)', 'Speech': 'For the first time in our history, insurrectionists had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power in America. First time. Smashing windows, shattering doors, attacking the police. Outside gallows were erected. As the MAGA crowd chanted “Hang Mike Pence.” Inside, they hunted for Speaker Pelosi. The house was chanting as they marched through and smashed windows, “Where’s Nancy?” Over 140 police officers were injured. Jill and I attended the funeral of police officers who died as a result of the events of that day. Because of Donald Trump’s lies, they died because these lies brought a mob to Washington. He promised it would be wild, and it was. He told the crowd to fight like hell and all hell was unleashed. He promised he would right them, right them. Everything they did, he would be side-by-side with them. Then as usual, he left the dirty work to others. He retreated to the White House. As America was attacked from within, Donald Trump watched on TV in the private small dining room off the Oval Office.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:30)', 'Speech': 'The entire nation watched in horror. The whole world watched in disbelief and Trump did nothing. Members of his staff, members of his family, Republican leaders who were under attack at that very moment, pled with him, act, call off the mob. Imagine had he gone out and said, stop. And still Trump did nothing. It was among the worst derelictions of duty by a president in American history. An attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence. A record 81 million people voted for my candidacy and to end his presidency. Trump lost the popular vote by 7 million. Trump’s claims about the 2020 election never could stand up in court. Trump lost 60 court cases. 60. Trump lost the Republican-controlled states. Trump lost before a Trump-appointed judge, and then judges. And Trump lost before the United States Supreme Court. All of it, he lost. Trump lost recount after recount after recount and state after state. But in desperation and weakness, Trump and his MAGA'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:04)', 'Speech': 'Let’s be clear about the 2020 election. Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election. Every one. But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth that I’d won the election and he was a loser. Well, so knowing how his mind works now, he had one act left, one desperate act available to him. The violence of January the 6th. And since that day, more than 1,200 people have been charged with assault on the Capitol. Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or pled guilty. Collectively to date they have been sentenced to more than 840 years in prison. What’s Trump done? Instead of calling them criminals, he’s called these insurrectionists patriots. They’re patriots. And he promised to pardon them if he returns to office.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:25)', 'Speech': 'Trump said that there was a lot of love on January the 6th. The rest of the nation, including law enforcement, saw a lot of hate and violence. One Capitol police officer called it a medieval battle. That same officer was called vile, racist names. He said he was more afraid in the Capitol of the United States of America, in the chambers, than when he was fighting as a soldier in the war in Iraq. He said he was more afraid inside the halls of Congress than fighting in the war in Iraq. In trying to rewrite the facts of January 6th, Trump was trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election. But we knew the truth because we saw it with our own eyes. It wasn’t like something, a story being told. It was on television repeatedly. We saw it with our own eyes. Trump’s mob wasn’t a peaceful protest. It was a violent assault. They were insurrectionists, not patriots. They weren’t there to uphold the Constitution. They were there to destroy the Constitution. Trump won’t do what an American president must do. He refuses to denounce political violence. So hear me clearly. I’ll say what Donald Trump won’t. Political violence is never, ever acceptable in the United States political system. Never, never, never. It has no place in a democracy. None. You can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. Trump and his MAGA supporters not only embrace political violence, but they laugh about it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:21)', 'Speech': 'At his rally, he jokes about an intruder whipped up by the big Trump lie, taking a hammer to Paul Pelosi’s skull and echoing the very same words used on January 6th. “Where’s Nancy?” And he thinks that’s funny. He laughed about it. What a sick… My God. I think it’s despicable, seriously. Not just for a president, for any person to say that, but to say it to the whole world listening. When I was overseas… Anyway. Trump’s assault on democracy isn’t just part of his past. It’s what he’s promising for the future. He’s being straightforward. He’s not hiding the ball. His first rally for the 2024 campaign opened with a choir of January 6th insurrectionists singing from prison on a cell phone while images of the January 6th riot played on a big screen behind him at his rally.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:33)', 'Speech': 'Can you believe that? This is like something out of a fairytale. A bad fairytale. Trump began his 2024 campaign by glorifying the failed violent insurrectionist insurrection on our Capitol. The guy who claims law and order sows lawlessness and disorder. Trump’s not concerned about your future, I promise you. Trump is now promising a full-scale campaign of revenge and retribution, his words, for some years to come. They were his words, not mine. He went on to say he’d be a dictator on day one. I mean, if I were writing a book of fiction and I said, “An American president said that,” and not in jest. He called, and I quote… This is a quote. “The termination of all the rules, regulation and articles, even those found in the U.S. Constitution, should be terminated,” if it fits his will.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:44)', 'Speech': 'It’s really kind of hard to believe. Even found in the Constitution, he could terminate? He’s threatened the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the death penalty. He says he should be put to death because the chairman put his oath to the Constitution ahead of his personal loyalty to Trump. This coming from a president who called, when he visited his cemetery, called dead soldiers “suckers and losers.” Remember that? Sometimes I’m really happy the Irish in me can’t be seen. It was right around the time I was at Beau’s grave, Tommy. How dare he? Who in God’s name does he think he is?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:52)', 'Speech': 'With former aides, Trump plans to invoke the Insurrection Act, which will allow him to deploy… He’s not allowed to do it in ordinary circumstances, allow him to deploy U.S. military forces on the streets of America. He said it. He calls those who oppose him “vermin”. He talks about the blood of America is being poisoned, echoing the same exact language used in Nazi Germany. He proudly posts on social media the words that best describe his 2024 campaign, “Revenge, power, and dictatorship.” There’s no confusion about who Trump is, what he intends to do. I placed my hand in our family Bible and I swore an oath on the very same steps of the Capitol, just 14 days after the attack on January the 6th.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:04)', 'Speech': 'As I looked out over the capital city whose streets were lined with National Guard to prevent another attack, I saw an American that had been pushed to the brink, an America that had been pushed to the brink. But I felt enormous pride, not in winning. I felt enormous pride in America because American democracy had been tested. American democracy had held together. And when Trump had seen weakness in our democracy and continued to talk about it, I saw strength. Your strength. It’s not hyperbole. Your strength. Your integrity. American strength and integrity. Ordinary citizens, state election officials, the American judicial system, had put the Constitution first and sometimes at their peril. At'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:54)', 'Speech': 'America, as we begin this election year, we must be clear: Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot. Yes, we’ll be voting on many issues: on the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, on the freedom of choice, the freedom to have a fair shot, the freedom from fear. We’ll debate and disagree. Without democracy, no progress is impossible. Think about it. The alternative to democracy is dictatorship: the rule of one, not the rule of We the People. That’s what the soldiers of Valley Forge understood. So was me, we have to understand it as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:46)', 'Speech': 'We’ve been blessed so long with a strong, stable democracy. It’s easy to forget why so many before us risked their lives and strengthened democracy, what our lives would be without it. Democracy means having the freedom to speak your mind, to be who you are, to be who you want to be. Democracy is about being able to bring about peaceful change. Democracy. Democracy is how we’ve opened the doors of opportunity wider and wider with each successive generation, notwithstanding our mistakes. But if democracy falls, we’ll lose that freedom. We’ll lose the power of We the People to shape our destiny.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:37)', 'Speech': 'If you doubt me, look around the world. Travel with me as I meet with other heads of state throughout the world. Look at the authoritarian leaders and dictators Trump says he admires, he out loud says he admires. I won’t go through them all. It’d take too long. Look, remember when he refers to what he calls love letter exchanges between he and the dictator of North Korea? Those women and men out there in the audience who have ever fought for the American military, would you ever believe you’d hear a president say something like that? His admiration for Putin. I could go on. Look at what these autocrats are doing to limit freedom in their countries. They’re limiting freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom to assemble, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, people are going to jail, so much more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:37)', 'Speech': 'It’s true. The push and pull of American history is not a fairy tale. Every stride forward in America is met with a ferocious backlash many times from those who fear progress and those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain; from those who traffic in lies told for power and profit; for those who are driven by grievance and grift, consumed by conspiracy and victimhood; from those who seek to bury history and ban books. Did you ever think you’d be at a political event talking about book banning in a presidential election?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:18)', 'Speech': 'The choice and contest between those forces, those competing forces, between solidarity and division is perennial. But this time, it’s so different. You can’t have a contest, you can’t have a contest if you see politics as an all-out war instead of a peaceful way to resolve our differences. All-out war is what Trump wants.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:46)', 'Speech': 'That’s why he doesn’t understand the most fundamental truth about this country. Unlike other nations on Earth, America is not built on ethnicity, religion, geography. We’re the only nation in the history of the world built on an idea, not hyperbole, built on an idea: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal.” It’s an idea declared in the Declaration, created in a way that viewed everybody as equal and should be treated equal throughout their lives. We’ve never fully lived up to that. We have a long way to go. But we’ve never walked away from the idea. We’ve never walked away from it before. But I promise you, I will not let Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans force us to walk away now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:40)', 'Speech': 'We’re living in an era where a determined minority is doing everything in its power to try to destroy our democracy for their own agenda. The American people know it, and they’re standing bravely in the breach. Remember, after 2020, January 6th insurrection to undo the election in which more Americans had voted than any other in American history? America saw the threat posed to the country, and they voted him out. In 2022, historic midterm election, in state after state, election after election, the election deniers were defeated. Now, in 2024, Trump is running as the denier-in-chief, the election denier-in-chief. Once again, he’s saying he won’t honor the results of the election if he loses. Trump says he doesn’t understand. Well, he still doesn’t understand the basic truth. That is, you can’t love your country only when you win. You can’t love your country only when you win.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:55)', 'Speech': 'So I’ll keep my commitment to be president for all of America, whether you voted for me or not. I’ve done it for the last three years, and I’ll continue to do it. Together, we can keep proving that America is still a country that believes in decency, dignity, honesty, honor, truth. We still believe that no one, not even the President, is above the law. We still believe. The vast majority of us still believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at making it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:40)', 'Speech': 'We’re still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. I tell you from my experience working with leaders around the world, and I mean this sincerely, not a joke, that America is still viewed as the beacon of democracy for the world. I can’t tell you how many world leaders, and I know all of them, virtually all of them, grab my arm in private and say, “He can’t win. Tell me. No, my country will be at risk.” Think of how many countries, Tommy, you know, that are on the edge. Imagine. We still believe in We the People, and that includes all of us, not some of us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:26)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. In that cold winter of 1777, George Washington and his American troops at Valley Forge waged a battle on behalf of a revolutionary idea, that everyday people, like where I come from and the vast majority of you, not a king or a dictator, that everyday people can govern themselves without a king or a dictator. In fact, in the rotunda of the Capitol, there’s a giant painting of General George Washington, not President'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:20)', 'Speech': 'In America, genuine leaders, democratic leaders with a small d don’t hold onto power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people, and they do it willingly because that’s the deal. You do your duty, you serve your country, and ours is a country worthy of service as many Republican presidents and Democratic presidents have shown over the years. We’re not perfect, but at our best, we face head on the good, the bad, the truth of who we are. We look in the mirror and ultimately never pretend we’re something we’re not. That’s what great nations do, and we’re a great nation. We’re the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. We really are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:17)', 'Speech': 'That’s the America I see in our future. We get up, we carry on, we never bow, we never bend, we speak of possibilities, not carnage. We’re not weighed down by grievances. We don’t foster fear. We don’t walk around as victims. We take charge of our destiny. We get our job done with help of the people we find in America, who find their place in a changing world and dream and build a future that not only they, but all people deserve a shot at. We don’t believe, none of you believe America’s failing. We know America’s winning. That’s American patriotism. It’s not winning because of Joe Biden. It’s winning. This is the first national election since January 6th, insurrection placed the dagger at the throat of American democracy since that moment. We all know who Donald Trump is. The question we have to answer is, who are we? That’s what’s at stake. Who are we?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:42)', 'Speech': 'In the year ahead as you talk to your family and friends, cast your ballots, the power is in your hands. After all we’ve been through in our history, from independence to civil war, to two world wars, to a pandemic, to insurrection, I refuse to believe that in 2024, we Americans will choose to walk away from what’s made us the greatest nation in the history of the world. Freedom, liberty, democracy is still a sacred cause, and there’s no country in the world better positioned to lead the world than America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:25)', 'Speech': 'I’ve said it many times, that’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about our future, and I’ve been doing this a hell of a long time. Just remember who we are with patience and fortitude, with one heart. We are the United States of America for God’s sake. I mean it. I believe with every fiber, there’s nothing beyond our capacity if we act together and decently with one another. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I mean it. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went into that crisis. That was true yesterday, it is true today, and I guarantee you, will be true tomorrow. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. I understand power. Thank you all much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Singing)'}]"

And Bishop Crane, thank you for those kind words. I mean that sincerely, and thank you Reverend Manning, the shepherd of this house, to allow me to stand to this podium once again and all the faithful of Mother Emmanuel and distinguished guests. I was talking downstairs. I’ve spent more time in the Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware than most people I know black or white have spent in that church, because that’s where I started. No, I’m serious. I started a civil rights movement. I used to go to 7:30 mass, then I’d go to ten o’clock service with the reverend who was then running the church, who’s now the bishop. She’s a bishop. And I’m told your bishop had been there before in South Africa. That’s where he is right now. The point is that I’ve been blessed to worship here before as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:10)', 'Speech': 'At moments of great joy and moments of great pain, moments of unbearable loss. On June 17th, 2015, the beautiful souls, five survivors and five survivors invited a stranger into this church to pray with them. The word of God was pierced by bullets and hate of rage propelled by not just gunpowder, but by a poison. Poison has for too long haunted this nation. What is that poison? White supremacy. Oh, it is. It’s a poison throughout our history. It’s ripped this nation apart. This has no place in America, not today, tomorrow, or ever. From that day, this nation saw this congregation, this community demonstrate one of the greatest acts of strength I have ever seen. I mean this sincerely from the bottom of my… the act of forgiveness, the act of grace. It was as President Obama sang from here, Amazing Grace. It changed hearts. You did something. It may not have happened, but for your courage. You brought down the Confederate flag in South Carolina. You brought it down. No, you did.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:39)', 'Speech': 'And you helped the nation heal. You showed what America can overcome, what we can be when we want to be something. I’m deeply humbled to speak from this same pulpit my friend and he was a friend, Reverend Pinckney spoke from. We all miss him. None more than his family and this congregation, but just as all the families of the Emanuel Nine missed the pieces of their soul that they lost that day, we also have been together at moments of unbearable loss for my family. Two days after the service of Reverend Pinckney, my surviving son, and I came back. My family worshiped with you here at Sunday Service to show our solidarity, but my family also needed to be healed. We didn’t even realize how badly, just twenty-two days before we had buried my son Beau, a veteran exposed and died because of those burn pits in Iraq for a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:48)', 'Speech': 'We were in more pain than we knew. We came here to offer comfort and receive comfort from you. No, I’m serious. As I listened in the pews, spent time with the families, visited Reverend Pinckney’s office, visited the memorial for the victims outside, I grew stronger. My son, my family grew stronger. We prayed together, we grieved together. We found hope together. For real, for real. And it reminds me that through our pain, each of us, each us must find purpose. For me, that purpose was to live a life worthy of my son Beau, and I mean it sincerely. For you that purpose is for the lives worthy of loved ones lost to make them proud. So many of you were there for us during that loss, including my dear friend Jim and Emily [inaudible 00:06:54]. Miss Emily I miss. People of deep faith.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:59)', 'Speech': 'Jim, a great public servant, the best friend you could ever have. Jim, I’m thinking Emily today, we’ve talked about it downstairs a little bit. I know you do every single solitary day. She was special and that bond you shared was something to behold. As many of you know, Jim is a teacher and a student of history. He knows the power of history. He knows the power of truth and the power of lies. He knows what happens when people are allowed to whitewash history, erase history, bury history. He knows what the Bible teaches. We shall know the truth and the truth shall set us free. But the truth, the truth is under assault in America. As a consequence, so is our freedom, our democracy, our very country because without the truth, there’s no light. Without light there’s no path from this darkness.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:44)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, after the Civil-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:32)', 'Speech': 'So, let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War. There is no negotiation about that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:46)', 'Speech': 'Now we’re living in an era of a second lost cause. Once again, there are some in this country trying to turn a loss into a lie, a lie, which if allowed to live, will once again bring terrible damage to this country. This time, the lie is about the 2020 election, the election which you made your voices heard and your power known.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:12)', 'Speech': 'Just two days ago, we marked the third anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history: January the 6th. The day in which insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol, trying for the first time in American history to stop the peaceful transfer of power in the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:29)', 'Speech': 'We all saw with our own eyes the truth of what happened. That violent mob was whipped up by lies from a defeated former President, smashing windows, smearing blood on statues, ransacking offices. Outside, insurrectionists erected gallows, chanting “Hang Mike Pence.” Inside, they hunted for Nancy Pelosi, chanting “Where’s Nancy?”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:55)', 'Speech': 'We saw something on January 6th we’d never seen before, even during the Civil War. Insurrectionists waving Confederate flags inside the halls of Congress built by enslaved Americans. A mob attacked and called Black officers, Black veterans defending the nation those vile of racist names.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:15)', 'Speech': 'And yet, an extreme movement of America, the MAGA Republicans, led by a defeated President, is trying to steal history now. They tried to steal an election. Now they’re trying to steal history, telling us that violent mob was, and I quote, “a peaceful protest.” That those insurrectionists were, these are his words, “patriots.” That there was, quote, “a lot of love that day.” In fact, the rest of the nation and the world saw a lot of hate and violence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:46)', 'Speech': 'For hours, the defeated former President sat in the private dining room off of the Oval Office and did nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing. His actions were among the worst derelictions of duty by any president in American history. An attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:12)', 'Speech': 'Let me say what others cannot. We must reject political violence in America. Always, not sometimes, always. It’s never appropriate. The violence of January 6th was an extension of an old playbook from the threats and violence and intimidation. In Atlanta, Georgia, two brave Black women, mother and daughter, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, they had their lives upended just doing their jobs, menacing calls, death threats, forcing them to literally flee their homes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:48)', 'Speech': 'Those pushing the Big Lie have a conspiracy theory among conspiracy theories that outweighs them all that there’s what… But here is the fact. There is where we don’t have facts, their whole theory has no facts, has no proof, has no evidence. That’s why, time and again, they lost in every court of law that challenged the results, 60 losses in courts of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:12)', 'Speech': 'There’s one thing they don’t have. They don’t have respect for the 81 million people who voted the other way, voted for my candidacy, and voted to end the presidency.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:25)', 'Speech': 'In their world, these Americans, including you, don’t count. But that’s not the real world. That’s not democracy. That’s not America. In America, we all count. In America, we witness to serve all those who, in fact, participate. And losers are taught to concede when they lose. And he’s a loser.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:01)', 'Speech': 'And then, we all came together to put the country before ourselves. The lies that led to January 6th are part of a broader attack on the truth America today that we all have seen before. The same movement that, throughout the mob at the United States Capitol, isn’t just trying to rewrite history of January 6th, they’re trying to determine to erase history and your future: banning books; denying your right to vote and have it counted; destroying diversity, equality, inclusion all across America; harboring hate and replacing hope with anger and resentment and a dangerous view of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:47)', 'Speech': 'That narrow view of America, a zero-sum view of America that says, “If you win, I lose. If you succeed, it must be I failed. If you get ahead, I fall behind.” And maybe worst of all, “If I hold you down, I lift myself up.” That’s not new in America. Every stride forward has often been met with ferocious backlashes from those who fear the progress, from those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain, from those who traffic in lies told for profit and power.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:28)', 'Speech': 'But here in Charleston, you know the power of truth. Less than a mile from here was once a port where almost half of all enslaved Africans were trafficked to North America and forced on our shores. And now you have a world-class museum there to tell the truth about the original sin. And it matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:54)', 'Speech': 'And I want to thank former Mayor Jim Riley for his leadership, who saw to it the museum was built, and for all of you who made that happen. And with your help, I made Juneteenth the first federal holiday since Dr. Martin Luther King Day.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:20)', 'Speech': 'This works?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:22)', 'Speech': 'Why? Because the truth matters. The truth matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:27)', 'Speech': 'With your help, we established the national monument in honor of Mamie and Emmett Till because we heard Mrs. Till’s call, the mother of a 14-year-old son who was lynched and whose body was mutilated, but the mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral because she said, “Let the world see what I saw.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:52)', 'Speech': 'The truth matters. It always matters. We can’t just choose to learn what we want to know'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:23)', 'Speech': 'I’m here to speak to another truth. It’s because of this congregation and the Black community of South Carolina, and not an exaggeration, and Jim Clyburn, that I stand here today as your president, because of all of you. That’s a fact. That’s a fact. And I owe you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:56)', 'Speech': 'And I’ve done my best to honor your trust. That means rejecting a small, narrow, cramped view of America. As well as lifting up a bigger and broader view of America that holds that: if you do well, I do well, we all do well. We all do well if every race and background and small towns and big cities is doing better. When our freedoms are protected and we deny hate as a safe harbor, where everyone has a fair shot at a life of dignity and opportunity, and where our democracy works for everybody. It benefits everybody. I don’t get these guys. Everybody does better, even those folks who disagree with us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:41)', 'Speech': 'I’m keeping my commitment to you. That’s the America we’re building together, instead of erasing history, we’re making history. And it starts with the administration I committed to. I said my administration would look like America. It taps into our full talents and strengths as a nation, starting with our incredible vice president, Kamala Harris.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:08)', 'Speech': 'When we came to office, the country was in the depth of a pandemic, which we lost over 1,000,200 people. So we moved heaven and earth to get the country vaccinated, saving countless lives. When the economy on the brink, we sent $1,400 checks into the pockets of people who were hurting badly to keep them going. I said we’d invest in all of America, all of America, and we are. The results are clear. Over 14 million new jobs, a record economic growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world, but we have more to do. We see this progress for all Americans. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate recorded in a long, long time. More Blacks, Americans have health insurance than ever, bringing peace of mind and dignity to their lives.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:02)', 'Speech': 'I remember when I was a kid, we lived in a three bedroom house with four kids and a grandpa living with us, and my headboard and my room was up against… it was a little split-level home. We weren’t poor, we were… Anyway, we sure weren’t wealthy. And I remember really one night hearing my dad restless because the headboard was along my headboard on the other side of the wall. I asked my mom the next morning, I said, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “Honey, his employer just told them they’re dropping health insurance.” If that doesn’t deprive a man and a woman and their dignity? How do you look at your child and say, I can’t cover you, I can’t take care of you?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:46)', 'Speech': 'And now as Jim pointed out, I won’t go into it like I was going to because he said it better. Instead of an average of $400 a month for insulin for seniors with diabetes, we’re now paying $35 a month. By the way, they’re still making a profit three times. It costs $10 to make it. I’ve been trying to take on, as a couple of you in the audience know, for my entire career, big pharma. Finally beat them. Finally, finally, finally. And we’re going to go back and make sure that Medicare can negotiate prices for everybody, not just for seniors. Again, it saves the American taxpayers billions of dollars not having to pay pharma for these things.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:39)', 'Speech': 'You know, we’re growing back Black wealth. But we have a lot more to do, the racial wealth cap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years under my watch. More Black small businesses starting up than in decades in the ultimate act and opening a new business, the ultimate act of hope. We’re taking on housing discrimination in many ways. So a home owned by today, a home owned by a Black family on one side of a highway, built by the same builder on the other side of the highway, and a white guy living in. The white guy’s home is valued more than the Black guy’s. No, I know you know it, but guess what? That’s how you build generational wealth when you build your home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:22)', 'Speech': 'Kamala and I are leading the charge, mainly Kamala, to protect the freedom to vote and that vote that be counted. Defending your freedom to choose, we’re keeping our commitment of providing incredible opportunities, making historic investments in HBCUs, $7 billion, 7 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:40)', 'Speech': 'They’re just as good as other universities, just owing that they don’t have the billionaire contributors, so they can’t put the laboratories together to get the contracts to be the ones to design new aircraft carrier decks, being the ones to design… But it’s changing, it’s changing. Providing people a real shot by reducing the burden of student debt. Jim went into it, I won’t go into it, I was going to, $132 billion, 3.6 million people. Significant percentage of those students are African-American students.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:19)', 'Speech': 'Despite our friends on the other side of the table, the Supreme Court did everything we can to stop me replacing every lead pipe in America. You know how many, not just some. Every single lead pipe in America is going to be taken out and replaced with a [inaudible 00:24:33]. Why? Because in mostly poor neighborhoods that’s where those lead pipes are, and that’s where kids end up with brain damage because of the lead. I’m not going to go into it, but look, you can turn on a faucet for your child and it doesn’t get sick from drinking the water coming into the home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:53)', 'Speech': 'Delivering high-speed internet that’s affordable for everybody. Everybody. So you don’t have to sit in McDonald’s parking lot for your child to do their homework.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:02)', 'Speech': 'Producing clean energy so you can finally breathe clean air without leaving home. Look, I understand it. When we moved from Scranton, I was raised in Claymont, Delaware, more major refineries than any place, including Houston, Texas, and just across the border in Chichester. Not a joke. I grew up with asthma, most of us did, because of the prevailing wind. Because my mom would drive us to school in the morning as young grade school. When there was a frost, turn on the windshield wiper, there’d be an oil slick on the wiper. Because guess what, it’s all the fence line communities that get hurt. Not on my watch. It’s changing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:40)', 'Speech': 'But we know there’s more to do, making childcare and elder care more affordable, which would save American taxpayers billions of dollars along the way. Early in my administration, we cut child poverty in half, Black child poverty in half, by getting families checks every month through the childcare tax credit. And the other side went ahead and blocked it, but we’re going to get it back. This fight isn’t over. We’re going to come back because no child in America should ever go to bed hungry. Period, period, period, period.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:21)', 'Speech': 'After the historic movement for justice in the summer of 2020, I signed the most significant police reform executive order in history. We didn’t get the law passed, but guess what? I did it by executive order, a significant part of it. But now Congress has to step up and ask and get it, do what I did and make it the law of the land.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:43)', 'Speech': 'Just a few days ago, the defeated former president was asked about the recent shooting in Iowa. Did you hear this one? It’s hard to believe. You know what his response was, all those kids dead? “We have'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:14)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, as Jim pointed out, more Black women have been appointed to the federal circuit courts than every other president in American history has appointed. Every single solitary one counted. And we’re going to keep going. Look, I want to make it clear, you all made this possible because of your voice. Your voice was heard in shaping your destiny. That’s democracy. I’m proud to have led the effort to make sure your voice, the South Carolina voice will always be heard because now you’re first in primary.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:56)', 'Speech': 'Look, our North Star as a nation is the very idea of American, an idea. At once the most simple and most powerful idea in the history of the world. That’s not hyperbole. In fact, the idea is this, we’re all created in the image of God equally. We deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. That covets a covenant we made with each other. A covenant we’ve never fully lived up to, but one we never fully walked away from either. And faith in history teach us that however dark the night, joy come within the morning. And that joy comes with commands from scripture. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy mind, all thy soul. And love your neighbor as thyself. It’s not so easy. It’s hard. But in those commands is the essence of the gospel and the essence of the American promise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:59)', 'Speech': 'And in my life, I’ve tried to live my faith and I have many times failed. But I’ve learned, as many of you might’ve learned in your path as well, we’re all, we’re all imperfect beings. We don’t know where fate will take us or when, but we can do our best to seek a life of light, hope, love, and justice and truth. Folks, let me close with this. Denmark Vesey arrived in Charleston enslaved, one of too many, too many from a distant shores, wrenched on a painful journey, not to a promised land, but to a land that promised to deprive him of freedom. But even though they arrived in the land where the life and rife of pain and persecution, they still believed they had promise. And the Black church kept them moving. They had faith. They found scripture. Faith is a substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen. Vesey had his kind of faith. He became a carpenter and a movement leader concerned with the least among us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:17)', 'Speech': 'That’s why he helped found this very church 200 years ago, only 40 years after the Declaration of Independence. And this church, your church now, the Black church has some to come to symbolize the faith and this purpose, to bear witness to those who are suffering, to bring the good news of a future to come, to follow its mission, to be the light in the pathway of darkness. That’s patriotism, that’s patriotism. To love something so much you make it better no matter the struggle. A patriotism that inspired the generation before us to believe that in America we can do and be anything we want to be. In our time, there’s still the old ghost of new garments and we all need to rise to meet the moment and the moment is now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:16)', 'Speech': 'Folks, our fellow Americans, this is a time of choosing. So let us choose the truth. Let us choose America. I know we can do it together and as the gospel song sings, we’ve come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far to leave me. My fellow Americans, I don’t think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}]"

Thanks to the hard work of physicians, women and advocates, Ohioans passed an amendment to constitutionally protect reproductive rights. It was a victory and a relief for the patients that I serve. We need women across the country, no matter what state they live in, to have that right. President Biden and Vice President Harris are working every day to restore that right and I’m grateful to them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:57)', 'Speech': 'It is my honor to be here today and introduce a true champion for women across the country, President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:16)', 'Speech': 'Well, good afternoon, folks. Doctor, thank you for sharing your story and I’m sure there’s others like it, many doctors across America have had to contemplate. 51 years ago today in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court recognized the woman’s constitutional right to choose, constitutional right to choose, the right to make a deeply personal decision with her doctor, free from the interference of politicians. I believe Roe v. Wade was right. I’m not supporting… They didn’t support abortion on demand. It was Roe v. Wade, roe v. Wade was the decision and a majority of Americans agreed. But then a year and a half ago, this Supreme Court, this Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe with their Dobbs decision to rip away a constitutional right from the American people, which had never been done before. A fundamental right ripped away, important to so many Americans. A right that is vital to a country founded on the idea of freedom.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:22)', 'Speech': 'I said on that day that Roe was overturned the health and lives women in this nation would now be at risk, and that has unfortunately proven to be true. They’ve been at risk. It made them at risk, put them at risk. Today in 2024 in America, women are turned away from emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic healthcare in another state that may have a different rule, forced to go to court to plead for help. Thanks to a mother of two in Texas who was pregnant with her third child, from her doctor, she received the news that no one wants to hear. The life of the child and her own life were at risk if she continued her pregnancy. But instead of being able to receive care from her doctor, she was blocked by the state of Texas’ Attorney General and the state Supreme Court. Think about that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:20)', 'Speech': 'As she and her family were going through the frightening, heartbreaking ordeal, she had to fight extreme politicians in the court. They turned a deeply private and painful matter into a public matter. She ultimately had to leave the state to get the help she needed to protect herself and her ability to have more children in the future. The cruelty is astounding and a front to a woman’s dignity being told by extreme politicians to wait to get sicker and sicker to the point where her life may be in danger before you can get the care you need. That cruel reality is a result of extreme Republicans who for years have made it their mission to end the Roe v. Wade decision. Since Roe was overturned in 21 states, abortion bans are now in effect, many with no exception for rape or incest. We have doctors with us today who are on the front lines of this crisis, and they can attest of the consequences that these extreme laws are having on doctors and on their ability to care for their patients.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:29)', 'Speech': 'Some doctors are fleeing their home states because of the laws that would send them to prison for providing evidence-based healthcare. In states like Texas, doctors can get a life sentence, a life sentence, for providing the care they were trained to provide. It’s outrageous. It’s simply outrageous. And frankly, this is just the beginning. My Congressional Republican friends are going even further extremes to undermining a woman’s right and threatening the lives of women. Three different Republican members in the United States Congress have proposed three different additional national bans to criminalize healthcare in every state.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:12)', 'Speech': 'Let me tell you what they are. One is zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions, A zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second is a six-week ban. The penalty for violating it is jail. The third is a fifteen-week ban. The penalty is a five-year prison sentence. That means even if you live in a state where extremist Republicans are not running the show, your right to choose, your right to privacy would still be at risk if this law was passed, any of these were passed nationally, and the extreme right is trying to limit all women in America from getting safe and effective medication approved by the Federal Drug Administration over 20 years ago based on the FDA’s independent expert judgment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:02)', 'Speech': 'They’re trying to block women from getting this medication even in states where abortion is legal. And on top of all of that, if you live in a state where you cannot get this care you need and you make a plan to travel to a state where you can get the medicine, Republicans officials are trying to stop that as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:24)', 'Speech': 'And get this, in Alabama, my mother would say, “God loved them,” the Attorney General is threatening to prosecute people who help family members travel to another state, who help family members travel to another state. Folks, this is what it looks like when the right to privacy is under attack. These extreme laws have no place, no place in the United States of America. The American people know these laws are wrong. The vast majority of Americans believe the right to choose is fundamental. Since the court overturned Roe v. Wade, every single time abortion has been on the ballot… and by the way, a lot of people don’t really understand. The court said that it’s up to the states to decide whether or not abortions are valid. So it says that if the state comes along and wants to say, “No, no, it’s valid in my state, Roe v. Wade is valid in my state,” it’s allowed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:22)', 'Speech': 'Well, guess what? Every single time that decision put before the people of the state in the battle in Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, voters have voted to protect reproductive rights, and we need these protections in every state because your family to have access to healthcare should not depend on your zip code, should not depend on your zip code.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:44)', 'Speech': 'As I’ve made clear, we have to do what the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs would allow, and that is Congress must codify Roe v. Wade for all the states in America. Stop playing politics with women’s lives and freedom. Let doctors do their job. Let me say it again. Pass laws restoring the protection of Roe v. Wade for women in every state. That’s what can be done under the Dobbs decision. But under this court that is going to be constitutional if we pass it nationwide.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:19)', 'Speech': 'That’s what I’m working for. I’m working for that law and when they send me that law, I’m going to sign it immediately and restore that right. Until then, my administration’s going to keep working to protect women in the wake of the Supreme Court’s extreme decision. That’s why I created a task force to ensure we’re doing everything we can to support women. I’ve signed executive orders and my administration has taken action to ensure that women get the care they need in medical emergencies, to protect a woman’s right to travel, to get healthcare, to protect a woman’s right to receive healthcare free from discrimination, and to protect her privacy. The idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she has been raped or victim of incest, I think it’s just cruel. To me it’s outrageous. The idea of a woman who received competent medical advice that the fetus she’s carrying wouldn’t live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future and can’t get medical… It’s ridiculous.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:24)', 'Speech': 'I could go on, but I’m already taking too much time. I want to thank the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, for her leadership in this important issue as she travels the country in her fight for freedom. I’d also like to thank the gender policy advisor, my gender policy advisor, Jen Klein. Jen, where’s Jen sitting? There you are, Jen. Thank you. And Secretary Becerra who’s sitting right next to her for their leadership in this task force. And I want to thank all the members of my Cabinet here today, including the Attorney General for leading efforts at the Department of Justice to protect reproductive rights in court. And Secretary McDonough for leading the important work being done at the VA.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:05)', 'Speech': 'I know that folks across America are worried about what they’re seeing happening to women all across America. I hear about it everywhere I go. My message is, we’re fighting hard to reinstate your rights and the rights to protect women and families and doctors who care for those women, and we need the American people to keep making their voices heard, so Congressional Republicans finally get the message that these laws do not represent the United States of America. Your voice will have a final say. This is not over.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:38)', 'Speech': 'With that, I’m going to sit down and we’re going to get to work. Thank you all for being here and let’s get this done. It’s important. Thank you.'}]"

Jim is the reason that I’m president, because he endorsed me and got all you to help me. But I later learned Emily convinced him to endorse me. Jim, we miss her. And you’re the best friend anyone could have.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:09)', 'Speech': 'Folks, if I were smart, I’d say “Thank you” and leave because Jim made the case for me better than I can make the case for me. Folks, and I love Columbia so much I asked your former mayor to join me in the White House. We’re fortunate to have Steve Benjamin at my side. But we’re really fortunate we put his better half on the federal bench. She’s doing an incredible job.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:48)', 'Speech': 'Just like I’m fortunate for my better half, Jill, who was here in Columbia last night with the women of Alpha Kappa Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha, excuse me. She had a wonderful time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:01)', 'Speech': 'And we’ve got so many real leaders here. Two former Chairs of the Congressional Black Caucus: Joyce Beatty, and you heard Marcia Fudge. Don’t mess with Marcia. And my home state senator, Chris Coons, who, a real quick story. When my son passed away… Well, anyway, Chris was just wonderful. He wouldn’t take the job. He wouldn’t run until he knew it was okay. We had to call Chris and say, “Chris, please run.” Because it was “Beau’s chair,” he said. Our great DNC chairman, Jaime Harrison from South Carolina. But the truth is I wouldn’t be here without the Democratic voters of South Carolina, and that’s a fact.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:55)', 'Speech': 'So, I want to start with a very simple message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:03)', 'Speech': 'If you ever doubt that the power to change America is in your hands, remember this: You proved it. You’re the reason I’m president. You’re the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. And you are the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you are the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:46)', 'Speech': 'Nearly four years ago, I came to Columbia to celebrate the primary victory, and I said then, and I quote, “For all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.” That same message has defined my presidency.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:06)', 'Speech': 'I’m determined-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:44)', 'Speech': 'Now, maybe Donald Trump and his MAGA friends believe that they to have to hold us down to lift everybody else up. I don’t believe that. I believe that America is big enough, strong enough, blessed enough for all of us to succeed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:05)', 'Speech': 'And that’s why we’re finally building an economy to grow from the middle out and the bottom up instead of trickle-down economy from the top. Because if you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. Just think back to the mess Donald Trump left this country in: a deadly pandemic, economic freefall, a violent insurrection.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:33)', 'Speech': 'I promised to do everything in my power, I said at the time, to get us through one of the toughest periods in our history. And together we are. We vaccinated America. We created a record 14 million new jobs in three years. Let’s get something straight. Trump talks about putting checks in pockets, but in 2021, as soon as I came to office, I was the guy who sent every one of you those $1,400 checks.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:05)', 'Speech': 'On top of that, I sent those $300 checks per child per family per month for hardworking families. That was thousands of dollars in pockets to get people through a real crisis. And here’s what it did-'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:03)', 'Speech': 'But look, folks, things this country have been through have been pretty tough for a lot of people. But we’re making progress. There’s a lot more on the way. Inflation’s coming down. It’s now lower in America than any other major economy in the world. The cost of eggs, milk, chicken, gas, and so many other essential items have come down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:24)', 'Speech': 'But for all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off: price gouging, junk fees, greedflation, shrinkflation. You see that article about the Snickers bars? Well, it’s going to stop. Americans, we’re tired of being played for suckers. And that’s why we’re going to keep these guys, keep on them and get the prices down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:53)', 'Speech': 'Folks, the bottom line is our economy has grown more in the last six months than it ever did at any point in Trump’s entire four years in office. And for too long, we imported products and exported jobs. But now, thanks to all we’re doing, we’re exporting American products and we’re bringing American jobs back home to America where they belong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:23)', 'Speech': 'America’s experiencing a manufacturing boom that no one thought was possible. But I knew it was possible. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs and counting, good-paying jobs. Record unemployment, including the lowest levels of Black unemployment ever recorded in American history. The racial wealth gap is at its lowest level in 20 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:54)', 'Speech': 'Trump’s $2 trillion tax cut when he was president benefited the super wealthy but was never paid for, and it completely blew up the federal deficit. We brought that deficit down.

But with our vote in 2024, we’re going to make it happen for everyone. Everyone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:56)', 'Speech': 'As Jim pointed out, out-of-pocket costs for seniors for all their prescriptions will soon be capped at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:11)', 'Speech': 'I’ve protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, giving millions of families over $800 in premiums and protecting their care from preexisting conditions.

Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And by the way, she’s smarter than the rest. I have appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals than every other president in American history combined, combined. A promise made and a promise kept.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:22)', 'Speech': 'And that includes Judge Michelle Childs of the DC Circuit, who is making South Carolina proud.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:31)', 'Speech': 'I promised to take care of hundreds of thousands of veterans exposed to toxic materials and care for their families.

Think about this, especially here in South Carolina, a proud military state, Donald Trump, when he was Commander-in-Chief, refused to visit a cemetery, a US cemetery outside of Paris for fallen American soldiers. And he referred to those heroes, and I quote, “as suckers and losers.” He actually said that. He said that. How dare he say that? How dare you talk about my son and all [inaudible 00:14:31] like that. Look, I call them patriots and heroes. The only loser I see is Donald Trump.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:43)', 'Speech': 'It makes me angry. I apologize for losing my temper, but it really, really, really offends me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:04)', 'Speech': 'In recent weeks, we’re starting to see real evidence that American consumers are facing real confidence in their economy we’re building. Let me tell you who else is noticing that: Donald Trump.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:18)', 'Speech': 'Did you see what he recently said about that he wants to see the economy crash this year? A sitting president. As they say in my faith, “Bless me, Father, for…” I mean, come on, man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:32)', 'Speech': '“When there’s a crash,” he said, “When there’s a crash, I hope in the next 12 months,” he went on to say. It’s unbelievable. It’s un-American. How can anyone, especially a former president, wish for an economic crash that would devastate millions of Americans? Well, let me tell you what he really means. Donald Trump knows this economy is good and strong and getting stronger. He knows that while it’s good for America, it’s bad for him politically.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:08)', 'Speech': 'Trump also said the one president he doesn’t want to be is Herbert Hoover. Well, Donald is too late. There are only two presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than when they took office: Herbert Hoover and yes, Donald “Herbert Hoover” Trump.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:27)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, have you noticed he’s a little confused these days? He apparently can’t tell the difference between Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:48)', 'Speech': 'Well, folks we’re making real progress on one of the most important issues we’re facing: security at the border. The first bill introduced was for a massive change in security at our border. Two months ago, my team beginning to work with a bipartisan group of senators to put together the toughest, smartest, fairest border security bill in history, the best one the nation’s ever seen. It would finally provide the funding I requested early on and again in October to secure our borders.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:19)', 'Speech': 'It includes an additional 1,300 border patrols. We need more agents on the border. 375 immigration judges to judge whether or not someone can come or not come and be fair about it. 1,600 are asylum officers. And over 100 cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop fentanyl coming outside our southwest border. It’ll also give me, as president, the emergency authority to shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I’d shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. A bipartisan bill would be good for American help fix our broken immigration system and allow speedy access for those who deserve to be here. And Congress needs to get it done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:09)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we’re just getting started. That’s why I’m so optimistic about our future. 40,000 projects across America and counting, rebuilding our roads and our bridges; affordable high-speed Internet everywhere in America; ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child can turn on a faucet, drink clean water without worrying about brain damage.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:37)', 'Speech': 'We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades. And I will not stop until we once again ban assault weapons, as I did once.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:54)', 'Speech': 'Now, look, I want you to imagine the future nightmare of Trump back in office. I’m serious. Given the nightmare when he was in office, you know what’s likely to come. Trump and his MAGA friends are trying again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and ripping away the protections you have under that, even if you have a preexisting condition. I won’t let that happen. Are you with me? I’ll not let that happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:31)', 'Speech': 'And instead of saving Social Security for working people and the middle class, although he said he wanted to get rid of it or change it, cut it drastically. He now says he’s for it. But guess what? Trump and his MAGA friends will give another massive tax break to the super wealthy and the biggest corporations. I won’t let that happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:51)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I know you’re with me. I know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your freedoms, like the freedom to vote. Trump brags about taking away a woman’s freedom to choose.

Are you with me?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:17)', 'Speech': 'I’ve made it clear: If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on abortion, I will veto it.

We believe we’re all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We leave no one behind. Everyone deserves a fair shot. We give hate no safe harbor. And we stand against the evil of racism, the poison of white supremacy today, tomorrow, and always. And we will live in the light, not darkness. We’ll stand with the truth and defeat the lies.

Special counsel wrote, and I quote, “Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump’s case and Mr. Biden’s are clear.” Continuing to quote. “Most notably, after giving multiple chances to return classified documents to avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it. In contrast, we wanted to say Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations, including his home, sat for a voluntary interview, and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:56)', 'Speech': 'I’ve seen the headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents. These assertions are not only misleading, they’re just plain wrong. On page 215, if you had a chance — I know it’s a thick document — on page 215, the report of the special counsel found the exact opposite. Here’s what he wrote. There is in fact a shortage of evidence that I willfully retained classified materials related to Afghanistan. On page 12, the special counsel also wrote for another documents, “The decision to decline criminal charges was straightforward. The evidence suggests that Mr. Biden did not willfully retain these documents.” The evidence said I did not willfully retain these documents. In addition, I know there’s some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There’s even reference that I don’t remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn’t any of their damn business.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:02)', 'Speech': 'Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented, I wear since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from Our Lady of… Every Memorial Day we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don’t need anyone to remind me when he passed away or if he passed away. Simple truth is I sat for a five-hour interview over two days of events going back 40 years at the same time I was managing an international crisis. Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case. That’s their decision to make, that’s the counsel’s decision to make. That’s his job. And they decided not to move forward. For any extraneous commentary, they don’t know what they’re talking about. It has no place in this report. The bottom line is the matter is now closed. I’m going to continue what I’ve always focused on, my job of being President of the United States of America. Thank you, and I’ll take some questions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:09)', 'Speech': 'It was in my house. It wasn’t out, like in Mar-a-Lago, in a public place. And none of it was high classified. Didn’t have any of that red stuff on it — you know what I mean? — around the corners. None of that. And so I wish I had paid more attention to how the documents were being moved and where. I thought they were being moved to the Archives. I thought all of it was being moved. That’s what I thought. Now, what was the last part of your question?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:07)', 'Speech': '[inaudible 00:09:13] hostage negotiation look?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:27)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been on the phone with the Qataris, I’ve been on the phone with the Egyptians, I’ve been on the phone with the Saudis to get as much aid as we possibly can into Gaza. There are innocent people, innocent women and children, who are also badly in need of help. And so that’s what we’re pushing, and I’m pushing very hard now to deal with this hostage ceasefire. I’ve been working tirelessly on this deal — how can I say this without revealing it? — to lead to a sustained pause in the fighting, in the actions taking place in the Gaza Strip. Because I think if we could get the delay, the initial delay, I think that we would be able to extend that so that we could increase the prospect that this fighting in Gaza changes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:24)', 'Speech': 'There’s also negotiations. You may recall in the very beginning, right before Hamas attacked, I was in contact with the Saudis and others to work out a deal where they would recognize Israel’s right to exist. Make them part of the Middle East and recognize them fully in return for certain things that the United States would commit to do. And the commitment that we were proposing to do related to two items; I’m not going to go in detail. But one of them was to deal with the protection against their arch enemy to the northeast. The second one, by providing ammunition and material for them to defend themselves. Coincidentally, that’s the timeframe when this broke out. I have no proof what I’m about to say, but it’s not unreasonable to suspect that the Hamas understood what was about to take place and wanted to break it up before it happened.'}]"

And His Majesty’s been a good friend all those years, a steadfast partner alongside the Queen, and a beloved leader to their people. The partnership between the United States and our ally Jordan is strong and it is enduring.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:03)', 'Speech': 'Today, the King and I discussed with our senior foreign policy staffs the issue that’s front and center in the Middle East and well beyond: the war between Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas. Over four months ago, on October the 7th, Hamas attacked Israel in an act of sheer evil, massacring more than 1,200 innocent women, men, and children, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:35)', 'Speech': 'More than 250 hostages were taken. A hundred and thirty-four are still being held hostage by Hamas. We don’t know how many are still alive. The anguish that their families are enduring week after week, month after month is unimaginable. And it’s a top priority for the United States to bring them home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:55)', 'Speech': 'I’ve made clear the United States shares the goal of seeing Hamas defeated and ensuring long-term security for Israel and its people.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:04)', 'Speech': 'After the October 7th attacks, Hamas retreated back into Gaza, where its leaders live in underground tunnels, stretching for over a hundred miles beneath civilian infrastructure, including, including schools, playgrounds, and neighborhoods.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:19)', 'Speech': 'The past four months, as the war has raged, the Palestinian people have also suffered unimaginable pain and loss. Too many, too many of the over 27,000 Palestinians killed in this conflict have been innocent civilians and children, including thousands of children. And hundreds of thousands have no access to food, water, or other basic services.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:44)', 'Speech': 'Many families have lost not just one but many relatives and cannot mourn for them, even bury them because it’s not safe to do so. It’s heartbreaking. Every innocent life in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well. We pray for those lives taken, both Israeli and Palestinian, and for the grieving families left behind.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:14)', 'Speech': 'Not only do we pray for peace, we’re actively working for peace, security, and dignity for both the Palestinian people and the Israeli people. And I’m working on this day and night with the King and others in the region to find the means to bring all these hostages home, to ease the humanitarian crisis and to end the terror threat and to bring peace to Gaza and Israel, an enduring peace with a two-state solution for two peoples.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:43)', 'Speech': 'As the King and I discussed today, the United States is working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, which would bring immediate and sustained period of calm to Gaza for at least six weeks, which we could then take the time to build something more enduring.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:02)', 'Speech': 'Over the past month, I’ve had calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as the leaders of Egypt and Qatar to push this forward. The key element of the deals are around the table. There are gaps that remain, but I’m encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal. The United States will do everything possible to make it happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:24)', 'Speech': 'The King and I also discussed the situation in Rafah. As I said yesterday, our military operation in Rafah, the major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan, a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than one million people sheltering there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:42)', 'Speech': 'Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north, and now they’re packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected. And we’ve also been clear from the start: We oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:03)', 'Speech': 'Today, the King and I also discussed in detail how to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. From the very beginning, my team and I have relentlessly worked to get more aid in. I urged Congress for months to make sure that our nation’s support for Israel and also includes urgently needed aid for innocent Palestinians. And I’ve spoken repeatedly with partners across the region, including the King, to help facilitate the flow of such aid into Gaza as much as possible and that will actually get to the people that are… need it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:37)', 'Speech': 'We worked to get the Rafah Crossing open. We worked to get Kerem Shalom open. And we insist that it remain open, both remain open. We’re working to open other routes as well. And we’re also working relentlessly to make sure aid workers can get the aid where it’s needed once it gets through.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:56)', 'Speech': 'I want to recognize Jordan and the King specifically for all he has done to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, including just a few days ago. He personally got in a plane and helped conduct an airdrop of urgently needed medical supplies into Gaza.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:13)', 'Speech': 'I understand that two of his children have also joined those airdrops. They help fly humanitarian supplies in. And for years, the Queen has been passionate, a passionate advocate for the Palestinian people, particularly women and children. Your family’s leadership, Your Majesty, and humanitarian commitment are commendable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:32)', 'Speech': 'And at the same time, we’re working to create the conditions for lasting peace, as we talked a lot about upstairs, with the Israeli security guaranteed and Palestinian aspirations for their own state fulfilled. I say this as a long, lifelong support of Israel. That’s the only path that guarantees Israel security for the long-term.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:53)', 'Speech': 'To achieve it, Palestinians must also seize the opportunity. As I discussed with the King today, the Palestinian authority must urgently reform so it can effectively deliver to the Palestinian people in both the West Bank and Gaza. Once Hamas’s controlled of Gaza is over, they must prepare to build a state that accepts peace, does not harbor terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:19)', 'Speech': 'And together, we will keep working to complete what we started: to integrate the region, to bring about peace between Israel and all its Arab neighbors, including the Palestinian state. That effort was already underway before October 7th attacks. It’s even more urgent today. No one, no one understands better than our allies and partners in the region, including the King, what we need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:46)', 'Speech': 'I’m grateful to him for his friendship, including his and Jordan’s unique role, unique role, a custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem. We’re grateful for this friendship. We saw that again just two weeks ago when three brave American service members killed an attack at a military outpost in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, by radical militant groups backed by Iran, operating in Syria and Iraq. Since then, US military forces have struck targets in Iraq and Syria. Our response will continue.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:21)', 'Speech': 'We’re grateful to our partners and allies like the King who work with us every single day to advance security and stability across the region and beyond. It’s difficult times like these when the bonds between nations are more important than ever. And Jill and I are pleased to welcome him and the Queen and the Crown Prince to the White House today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:41)', 'Speech': 'Your Majesty, over to you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:06)', 'Speech': 'My visit today carries an added meaning as our country’s this year mark 75 years of exemplary strategic partnership. However, we had hoped we would be marking this major milestone during better circumstances in my region and the world. Unfortunately, one of the most devastating wars in recent history continues to unfold in Gaza as we speak.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:31)', 'Speech': 'Nearly a hundred thousand people have been killed, injured, or are missing. The majority are women and children. We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe. The situation is already unbearable for over a million people who have been pushed into Rafah since the war started. We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting ceasefire now. This war must end. We must urgently and immediately work to ensure the sustainable delivery of sufficient aid to Gaza through all possible entry points and mechanisms. And I thank you, Mr. President, for your support on this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:24)', 'Speech': 'Restrictions on vital relief aid and medical items are leading to inhumane conditions. No other UN agency can do what UNRWA is doing in helping the people of Gaza through this humanitarian catastrophe. Its work in other areas of operation, especially in Jordan, where 2.3 million are registered, is also vital. It is imperative that UNRWA continues to receive the support it needs to carry out its mandate.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:56)', 'Speech': 'The potential threat of Palestinian displacement beyond the borders of Gaza and the West Bank is something we view with extreme concern and cannot be allowed. At the same time, we must not ignore the situation in the West Bank and in the holy sites in Jerusalem. Nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7th, including almost a hundred children, and over 4,000 injured.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:27)', 'Speech': 'Continued escalations by extremist settlers in the West Bank and Jerusalem’s holy sites and the expansion of illegal settlements will unleash chaos on the entire region. The vast majority of Muslim worshipers are not being allowed to enter Al-Aqsa Mosque. Christian churches have also voiced concerns about increasing and unprecedented restrictions and threats.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:52)', 'Speech': 'It is also important to stress that the separation of the West Bank and Gaza cannot be accepted. Seven decades of occupation, death, and destruction have proven beyond any doubt that there can be no peace without a political horizon.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:09)', 'Speech': 'Military and security solutions are not the answer. They can never bring peace. Civilians on both sides continue to pay for this protracted conflict with their lives. All attacks against innocent civilians, women and children, including those of October 7th, cannot be accepted by any Muslim, as I have previously stressed. We must make sure the horrors of the past few months since October 7th are never repeated nor accepted by any human being.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:44)', 'Speech': 'We must together, along with Arab partners and the international community, step up efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and immediately start working to create a political horizon that leads to a just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the two-state solution, an independent, sovereign, and viable Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, but living side by side with Israel in peace and security. This is the only solution that will guarantee peace and security for the Palestinians and the Israelis, as well as the entire region.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:27)', 'Speech': 'Your leadership, my dear friend, Mr. President, is key to addressing this conflict. And Jordan is ready to work, as always, with you towards peace.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:38)', 'Speech': 'Thank you.'}]"
https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-remarks-on-senate-passage-of-the-bipartisan-supplemental-agreement-transcript,2024-02-14,President Biden Delivers Remarks on Senate Passage of the Bipartisan Supplemental Agreement Transcript,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (00:20)', 'Speech': 'Earlier this morning the United States Senate, as you all know, voted overwhelmingly, by a margin of 70 to 29, to move forward with the Bipartisan National Security Bill. Now, it moves to the House. And I urge Speaker Johnson to bring it to the floor immediately. Immediately. There’s no question that if the Senate bill was put on the floor in the House Representatives, it would pass. It would pass. And the Speaker knows that. So, I call the Speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on. Even from being voted on. This is a critical act for the House to move. It needs to move. The bill provides urgent funding for Ukraine so it can keep defending itself against Putin’s vicious, viscous onslaught.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:18)', 'Speech': 'We’ve all seen the terrible stories of recent weeks. Ukrainian soldiers out of artillery shells. Ukrainian units rationing rounds of ammunition to defend themselves. Ukrainian families worried that the next Russian strike will permanently plunge them in the darkness or worse. This bipartisan bill sends a clear message to Ukrainians, and to our partners, and to our allies around the world, America can be trusted, America can be relied upon, and America stands up for freedom. We stand strong for our allies. We never bow down to anyone, and certainly not to Vladimir Putin, so let’s get on with this.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:58)', 'Speech': 'Remember, the United States pulled together a coalition of nearly 50 nations to support Ukraine. We unified NATO, we expanded it. We can’t walk away now. That’s what Putin’s betting on. He just flatly said that. Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing it is playing into Putin’s hands. As I’ve said before, the stakes in this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. If we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine, and the cost for America and our allies and partners are going to rise. For Republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine and not be held accountable, history is watching. History is watching. History is watching. Failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten. I want to be clear about something, because I know it’s important to the American people. While this bill sends military equipment to Ukraine, it spends the money right here in the United States of America, places like Arizona where the Patriot missiles are built, and Alabama where the Javelin missiles are built, and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, where artillery shells are made.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:17)', 'Speech': 'And the way it works is we supply Ukraine with military equipment from our stockpiles, and then we spend our money replenishing those stockpiles so our military has access to them, stockpiles that are made right here in America by American workers. That not only supports American jobs and American communities. It allows us to invest in maintaining and strengthening our own defense manufacturing capacity. Look, this bill meets our national security priorities in the Middle East as well, and includes greater support for our troops serving in the region, who continue to defend against militia attacks backed by Iran. It also provides Israel with what it needs to protect its people against a terrorist group like Hamas and Hezbollah and others, and it will provide life-saving humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people who desperately need food, water, and shelter. They need help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:11)', 'Speech': 'Finally, this bill includes critical funding for our national security priorities in Asia, because even as we focus on the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, we must not take our eye off our national security challenges in the Pacific. It’s the responsibility of a great nation, and we are a great nation that the rest of the world looks to, and I mean that. The rest of the world looks to us. The stakes were already high for American security before this bill was passed in the Senate last night. But in recent days, those stakes have risen, and that’s because the former president has set a dangerous and shockingly, frankly, un-American signal to the world. Just a few days ago, Trump gave an invitation to Putin to invade some of our NATO allies. He said, “If an ally didn’t spend enough money on defense,” he would encourage Russia to, “Do whatever the hell they want.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:04)', 'Speech': 'Can you imagine a former President of the United States saying that? The whole world heard it, and the worst thing is, he means it. No other president in our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. Let me say this as clearly as I can. I never will. For God’s sake, it’s dumb, it’s shameful, it’s dangerous. It’s un-American. When American gives its word, it means something. When we make a commitment, we keep it. And NATO is a sacred commitment. Donald Trump looks at this as if it’s a burden. When he looks at NATO, he doesn’t see the alliance that protects America and the world. He sees a protection racket. He doesn’t understand that NATO is built on fundamental principles of freedom, security, and national sovereignty. Because, for Trump, principles never matter. Everything is transactional. He doesn’t understand that the sacred commitment we’ve given works for us as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:06)', 'Speech': 'In fact, I would remind Trump, and all those who would walk away from NATO, Article 5 has only been invoked once, just once in our NATO history, and it was done to stand with America after we were attacked on 9/11. We should never forget it. Our adversaries have long sought to create cracks in the alliance. The greatest hope of all those who wish America harm is for NATO to fall apart. And you can be sure that they all cheered when they heard Donald Trump and heard what he said. I know this. I will not walk away. I can’t imagine any other president walking away. For as long as I’m president, if Putin attacks a NATO ally, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:55)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. You’ve heard me say this before. Our nation stands at an inflection point, an inflection point in history, where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of our future for decades to come. This is one of those moments, and I say to the House members, House Republicans, you got to decide, are you going to stand up for freedom, or are you going to side with terror and tyranny? Are you going to stand with Ukraine, or are you’re going to stand with Putin? Will you stand with America or with Trump?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:33)', 'Speech': 'Republicans and Democrats in the Senate came together to send a message of unity to the world. It’s time for the House of Republicans to do the same thing, to pass this bill immediately, to stand for decency, stand for democracy to stand up to a so-called leader hell-bent on weakening American security. And I mean it sincerely, history is watching. In moments like this, we have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America. The world is looking to us. There’s nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. In this case, acting together includes acting with our NATO allies. God bless you all, may God protect our Speaker, and I promise I’ll come back and answer questions later. Thank you.'}]"

I want to live my own American dream. I’ve been working hard, faced with repaying my loans for almost two decades. But like millions of Americans, doing the right thing wasn’t enough. As I paid my loans, I was steered into forbearance by my loan servicer. The interest grew and grew. I took out approximately $95,000 in loans, but after 18 years in repayment, I still had $144,652 left.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:02)', 'Speech': 'It’s crushing, until President Biden, who kept his commitment and completely forgave that $144,652, and that’s life-changing. I no longer have to be forced to choose to work or to settle to simply pay off student loan debt. I’m able to continue my passion for public service and keep serving as an adjunct faculty with the community college district and as a physician assistant at school-based health centers. I am now married. I’m able to pay my mortgage in Los Angeles. This freedom, this breathing room is because of President Joe Biden. And just two weeks ago I had my baby girl. It’s a defining moment for me to live my dream of being a mom, because President Biden has the back of hardworking Americans, public servants just like me. I can invest in my retirement, secure a brighter future for my daughter. It is with great honor and gratitude to introduce to you our president, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:24)', 'Speech': 'Thank you, thank you, thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:36)', 'Speech': 'Well, Dr. Saint Paul, thank you very much for the introduction, but you know you’re like a thousands of others who took out loans from undergraduate school and graduate school, because you wanted to serve your community, and you have, but in the meantime that $90,000 you borrowed grew to $145,000, even though you kept paying on a monthly basis. Folks, I’m happy to have been able to forgive these loans, because when we realize and relieve Americans of their student debt, they’re free to chase their dreams. And Doc, you got one of your dreams, your baby girl. By the way, an awful lot of people with student debt are putting off whether they can have a child, whether they can… A whole range of basic, basic fundamental issues.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:23)', 'Speech': 'And Mayor Bass, thank you for your partnership and maybe more importantly for me, your friendship. And I want to thank the Culver City Mayor. Where are you, Mayor? Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And it’s great to be joined by members of Congress. Alex and the Senate and Sydney in the house. I really appreciate your being here. It’s a Busman’s holiday for you guys to come here when other public official speak. But thank you. And I know our great vice president sends her love to all her California friends. She constantly… All I hear about is California. I’m glad to be here. When I was vice president, all I heard about was Chicago. But I’m trying to make sure they hear about Delaware, but it ain’t working yet.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:13)', 'Speech': 'Look, Kamala and I ran to lead this country. We made a commitment to fix our broken student loan system. That was one of the things we both talked about in the beginning. Because, while a college degree is still a ticket to a better life, that ticket is too expensive and too many Americans are still saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for a college degree. So there’s a student loan program to be able to afford a college degree, but a lot of people didn’t take advantage of it and I wanted to make sure they did. The ability to repay though has become so burdensome. A lot of people can’t even repay and they try. They don’t miss payments, they work like the devil every month to pay their bills, but even they pay their loans, their debt increases, doesn’t diminish because of interest rates. And I thought I’d make a lot more sense to relieve student debt for families and would grow our economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:04)', 'Speech': 'Well, there were existing programs in the law to fix and adjust the programs. We had to change them to make people actually… Make them available for you, make people eligible. And that’s what I’ve done when the Supreme Court said I couldn’t go ahead and relieve all the debt. It helps everyone, not just the people whose debt is relieved, but when people with student debt relieved, they buy homes, they start businesses, they contribute, they engage in the community in ways they weren’t able to before. It actually grows the economy. It grows the economy. That’s why my administration has taken significant action to provide student debt relief to so many boroughs, many who didn’t know they were able to get relief, and do it as quickly as possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:54)', 'Speech': 'Look, early in my term I announced a major plan to provide millions of working families with debt relief for their college student debt. Tens of millions of people in debt were literally about to be canceled their debts. But my [inaudible 00:06:08] Republican friends in the Congress and elected officials in special interests stepped in and sued us and the Supreme Court blocked it. They blocked it. But that didn’t stop me. I announced we were going to pursue alternative paths for student debt relief for as many borrowers as possible. And that’s the effort that’s been underway the last two years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:26)', 'Speech': 'I fixed what’s called the SAVE Plan. It existed, but I fixed it to make it the most affordable repayment plan ever. Before I took office, student borrowers had to pay 10% of their discretionary income on a monthly basis. If they made less than… If they didn’t have enough to do that, they were able to not have to pay that month, but their interest continued. A lot of people don’t have the means to do that though. Under my SAVE Plan, we’re cutting in half to 5%, what undergraduate borrowers have to pay after their living expenses are accounted for. That means no one with an undergraduate loan, whether it’s a community college or a four-year college will have to pay more than 5% of their discretionary income to repay those loans starting in July. And that’s income after you pay the net for necessities like food and housing. Already 7.5 million Americans have enrolled in this so-called SAVE Plan, and there’s more than 4 million of those borrowers who had their monthly payments dropped to zero if they’re living paycheck-to-paycheck below a certain level. This plan is the most generous repayment program ever, and today we’re doing it even faster and quicker than ever before.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:37)', 'Speech': 'I’m proud to announce our SAVE Plan. We are immediately canceling the debt loans for over 150,000 borrowers, nearly six months ahead of schedule. Starting today, we’re canceling student debt for borrowers who are enrolled in the SAVE Plan and have been paying student loans for as little as 10 years. If they borrowed less than $2,000, it’s forgiven. If they took $12,000, excuse me, the loan is forgiven. This actual will be a huge help to graduates of community college and borrowers of smaller loans, putting them back on track faster for debt forgiveness than ever before. This builds on other progress I’ve made in canceling student debt for close to 4 million Americans through various actions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:22)', 'Speech': 'For example, we fixed what was called the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which was designed to make sure the school teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, social workers, public servants, get their student loans forgiven if they make payments for 10 years in a row and do 10 years of public service at the same time. When I took office, there were 7,000 public servants who had taken advantage of this program and hadn’t forgiven. But thanks to the reforms we made in the program, now there are nearly 800,000, have had their debts forgiven. 800,000.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:56)', 'Speech': 'Well let me close with this. These kind of reliefs can be life-changing for individuals and for their families. And it’s good for the economy as a whole. By freeing millions of Americans from the crushing debt of student loan programs, it means they can finally get on with their lives instead of their lives being put on hold. They can think about buying a house, starting a home, starting a family, having a family future that they can enjoy, or saving for the family’s future. Saving and putting away a little bit of money. I’m proud to have been able to give borrowers like so many of you the relief you earned. I promise you, I’m never going to stop fighting for hard working in American families. So if you qualify, you’ll be hearing from me, shortly. Thousands of people per month, or about 25,000 a month, or every two months will be paid in a 50,000 basis, but are eligible for relief and they’ll getting a letter from me, letting them know they’re qualified. And when they get that letter, your debt’s going to be forgiven.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:06)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks. It’s also helping you who don’t go to college. It’s not just… People say to me sometimes, “Well, Joe, that’s great. You’re helping people get into college. But how about all those hardworking people you grew up within the neighborhood? How about all those folks in labor unions? How about all those hardworking people work with their hands? Why should they have?” Well, just today my labor department announced 200… This is not the student loan program, but $200 million of grants for registered apprenticeship programs around the country, while you can learn a skilled trade and lead to good paying jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:41)', 'Speech': 'Everybody thinks if you’re an electrician… They say, “I want to be an electrician”. You got to go to school basically. These apprenticeship programs are four and five years before you qualify to have a license. They work like hell to get these licenses. And guess what? If you work with your hands you ought to be able to make a decent living. And that’s why they’re doing it now with my position on organized labor. So it matters. All this matters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:08)', 'Speech': 'My dad used to say, “Joey, a job is about more than a paycheck.” It’s about your dignity. It’s about opportunity. It’s about being able to look at your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” You got a chance. That’s all we’re doing, and people are taking advantage. We’re giving people a chance, a fighting chance to make it, because no one whose was willing to work hard in America should be denied the opportunity to have that chance. And so…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:37)', 'Speech': 'How many of you had student loans forgiven here? All right. I tell you what, how about anybody over $10,000? $30,000? $50,000?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:32)', 'Speech': 'And the economy is growing. It’s growing. Jobs, income, across the board. We have the most advanced economy of any major nation in the world. We have a lot more to do. But with the help of all of you college graduates who’ve paid off your student loans now, I’m confident we’re going to get it all done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.'}]"

And Joe is so grateful for your leadership.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:12)', 'Speech': 'And so I have to say that Governor Cox, I want to say I’m grateful to you and Abby for the warm welcome in Utah last month. So good morning everyone, and it’s great to be here with all of you. And Governor Scott, when I visited Vermont last year, what you said really stayed with me. You said pure partisan politics has never contributed to real solutions, and that we can and should prioritize progress over politics, especially on issues where the majority of Americans agree. That majority is an exhausted one, I think you’ve seen that as Governor Cox often points out. They’re frustrated by a Congress that is often mired in gridlock, and those who too often treat government like a sport with an us-versus-them mindset and a knee-jerk reaction to oppose anything the other team supports. But this room shows the nation something different. And I wish that the lawmakers on the Hill would follow your lead. You show that we can turn down the volume, stop the shouting, and actually listen to one another, that yes, as Governor Cox says, we can disagree without being disagreeable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:51)', 'Speech': 'As many of you know, I’ve been teaching writing for 40 years as Tom referenced. So one day, a student named Harry who wanted to be an auto mechanic raised his hand, “Dr. B,” he said, “the only thing I need to learn how to write is ‘needs brakes.’ He was… Well, you finally got it. Come on, wake up. So he was joking of course. But he had a point. He wasn’t just there to learn the art of writing. He was there to help prepare himself for a good-paying job. For most people, a high school diploma alone isn’t enough to find a great career. But they don’t often need a four-year degree to pursue their passions either. And as technology brings changes to so many industries, these kind of learning paths are more important than ever.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:55)', 'Speech': 'Since he took office, my husband, President Biden, has been focused on rebuilding the middle class. I’m sure you’ve all heard him say that in your states. And today, millions of new jobs in infrastructure and clean energy and manufacturing are being created. We will need to train a new generation of workers to fill those jobs. And these positions pay well. Many of them require associate degrees or certificates or other hands-on instruction, not four years of college. Still, a lot of high school students don’t necessarily know how to get from earning their diplomas to earning a living. They may not even know what roles are out there. And that’s why we need to transform education so that it does a better job for preparing students for careers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:58)', 'Speech': 'Nearly 60% of graduating high school students don’t go to a four-year college. 60%, six out of every 10 students. Are high schools designed to meet the needs of those students, the majority who don’t go directly to a four-year university? Too many schools aren’t. Yes, we should still expand access and affordability for students who want to go immediately to a four-year college after high school. But we also need to dramatically expand the opportunities that we provide for students who may pursue something else. And that means that everyone has a chance to explore future careers in high school. Career connected learning meets that need. And I’ve seen it around the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:57)', 'Speech': 'In Wisconsin, Governor Evers is scaling a model for starting apprenticeships in high school in fields from finance to nursing. In Vermont, Governor Scott is investing in dual enrollment and free community college. And in Indiana, I saw how students are getting training for careers in clean energy. These states show us what it looks like when students have access to comprehensive career advising, when they’re able to take community college courses in high school and even earn a credential and when they can earn high school course credit for working at a job. I believe in evidence-based models, not just theories. And we know that this works.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:50)', 'Speech': 'An Oregon study found that students who concentrated in particular career area, graduated high school at higher rates and went on to earn higher wages. So you’re probably saying… I mean, I know a lot of you’re doing this, so what can you do? You can build out and grow career connected programs in your state. And I know, like I said, many of you are already doing this because I’ve been to your states to see the programs. Some of you are providing comprehensive career advising. Some are prioritizing access to dual enrollment between high school and community college. And some have impressive programs that allow students to work in real workplaces as part of their high school curriculum. And some states are expanding credentialing opportunities so that students can work toward obtaining a career qualification while in high school. But not enough states are doing all these things all at once for every student. So that’s what’s crucial in unlocking the potential of career-connected learning.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:06)', 'Speech': 'So I’m asking all of you, if you’re not doing this already, to lean in. Go to the businesses in your state and tell them how apprenticeships can boost productivity and reduce turnover. Go to your community college and K-12 leaders and work with them to expand dual enrollment opportunities that connect all students to good-paying jobs. And use my office, use me as a resource. Reach out to us. Let us know how we can help you lift up the great work that you’re already doing. And I hope that when this group gathers next, that we have even more successes to show.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:54)', 'Speech': 'So thank you for listening this morning. I appreciate it. But before I go, I want to come around. You have this card on your table.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:57)', 'Speech': 'As demonstrated by our administration’s record over the past three years, there are few leaders as committed to bipartisan collaboration than Joe Biden. President Joe Biden knows how to work across the aisle and across every level of government to make progress. Globally and domestically, he has a bold vision for our future and he has the strength, and I see it every day, and the skill and the courage and the determination to make that vision real. We are here today because we are all united by a common and collective purpose to create opportunity, prosperity and progress for the American people. As a former statewide elected leader, the Attorney General California, for two terms, I know firsthand the importance of state and federal collaboration. And, as Vice President, I have worked closely with many of you on issues like infrastructure, emergency response, and clean energy and on two issues that I will address briefly today, access to capital and maternal mortality.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:10)', 'Speech': 'First: Access to capital for small businesses. I don’t need to tell the Governors and the leaders here, America’s small businesses employ tens of millions of workers and generate trillions of dollars for our economy every year and their strength then is essential to a broad- based economic policy of growth. Growth which benefits businesses of all sizes. Small business owners are business leaders and they are civic leaders.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:42)', 'Speech': 'And so, building on the work that I help lead in the United States Senate, we have increased access to capital for the small businesses of America. President Biden and I are giving a total of $10 billion to states across our nation to invest in small businesses. And, as Vice President, I have had the honor of visiting almost half the states that are represented here today and I’ve seen, firsthand, the vitality of small business and knowing that that is essential to the vitality of our communities as a whole, not to mention how the growth of these small businesses generate tax revenue, which makes up, of course, a significant portion of the annual revenue of your states.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:26)', 'Speech': 'For these reasons, our focus has been to nurture the ambition and aspirations of everyone, from young entrepreneurs to multi-generational families, to help them with their success. And since taking office, we have seen a record number of small businesses in terms of their growth, the most small businesses ever created, in fact, in any three years in history, which is indicative of the overall growth of our economy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:55)', 'Speech': 'In addition to access to capital together, we have also taken on the issue of the maternal mortality crisis. It is something we cannot talk about enough in terms of the significance of this crisis. For years, federal public policy has not adequately addressed that before, during, and after childbirth. American women die at a higher rate than in any other wealthy nation in the world. The women of America die at a higher rate than the women of any other wealthy nation in the world. Over the years, I have spoken with too many people who have suffered because of this crisis. Mothers who have lost babies, men who have lost their spouse, children who have lost a parent. And of the many factors that contribute to this crisis, one of the most significant is that millions of women in America, in particular in low income communities, do not have access to adequate postpartum care.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:02)', 'Speech': 'In fact, when we took office, the vast majority of American women on Medicaid were only entitled to two months of coverage for postpartum care. Meaning two months after giving birth, she could lose access to life-saving care such as cardiac screenings, mental health counseling, and vaccinations. When the President and I took office, only three states offered 12 months of care. And so, I issued a challenge to every state in our nation: Extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from two months to 12 months and thanks to the leaders in this room, the Governors in this room, so far, a total of 44 states have answered that challenge. Yes. Including, as of today, Alaska, and two more states are in the process of extending coverage. And so, we recall on the remaining states to please do the same.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:07)', 'Speech': 'In closing, these two seemingly unconnected issues, through the collaboration between our administration and the Governors who are here, have contributed to the overall strength of our nation and the wellbeing of millions of Americans. And I thank you for your work. And now, I will welcome a leader who has been a great partner on maternal mortality and mental health, the chairman of the NGA and Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:34)', 'Speech': 'Our agenda at the National Governor’s Association meeting this week includes sessions on artificial intelligence, housing affordability, disaster response, workforce development, all of the topics the Governor Polis mentioned and more. Governors share ideas on all of these priorities as well. We welcome the opportunity to work with your administration on these issues. Now, that is not to say that we always agree. I can'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:53)', 'Speech': 'Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my honor to yield the floor to the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:26)', 'Speech': 'Folks, thank you very much. Governor Cox, Governor Polis, all the governors for being here. I know you just heard… Did Jill already speak? My wife? Well what the hell am I doing here now? Jill enjoys traveling to your states and to advance priorities like education and workforce development. And thanks to Commonwealth for her leadership and her incredible partnership across the board. And to the members of our cabinet including former Governor, and we have two former governors here. Are they both here today? Governor Raimondo? Where’s my Secretary of Agriculture? Is he here? Well, he’s going to be here tomorrow. Tom Vilsack. He’s going to be here tomorrow. My Republican friends, I got bad news for you. I actually like working with you and it reminds me of the days I was in the Senate. We’d argue like hell and then we’d get things done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:22)', 'Speech': 'But look, before I begin I want to say a few words about an important anniversary that we mark tomorrow. Two years ago, shortly before dawn, Russian troops marched across the border in Ukraine, and Putin believed he could easily bend the will and break the resolve of the free people of Ukraine. That he could roll into Ukraine and he would roll over them. Two years later he remains wrong. He didn’t do that. He wasn’t able to do that. Kyiv is still standing, Ukraine is still free, and the people of Ukraine remain unbowed and unbroken in the face of Putin’s vigorous onslaught.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:57)', 'Speech': 'This is due to their sheer bravery and their sacrifice, but it’s also due to us. Remember the United States pulled together a coalition of more than 50 nations, 50 nations to support Ukraine. We unified and expanded NATO. We can’t walk away now, and this’s what Putin is betting on. He’s betting on we’re going to walk away. That’s Robbie speaking to the G7 folks, some of the heads of the European Union and NATO today. That’s why I’m announcing more than 500 new sanctions in response to Putin’s brutal war of conquest, in response to Alexei Navalny’s death. Because make no mistake, Putin is responsible for Alexei’s death. Yesterday I met with Alexei’s wife and daughter in California where his daughter attends college. Alexei was a incredibly courageous man. His family is courageous as well. I assured them his legacy will continue to live around the world and we in the United States are going to continue to ensure that Putin pays the price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:13)', 'Speech': 'But let me be clear. The House of Representatives must pass the Bipartisan National Security bill. The bill provides urgent funding for Ukraine and it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. And there’s no question, none, none, if the Speaker called for vote in the house, it would pass easily today. Instead, they went on vacation. I mean, it’s just… Look, folks, all kidding aside, history’s watching, the clock is ticking. Brave Ukrainian soldiers and civilians are dying. Russia, Russia is taking UK Ukraine territory for the first time in many months, but here in America, the Speaker gave the House a two-week vacation. They have to come back. They have to come back and get this done. Because failure to support Ukraine in this critical moment will never be forgotten in history. It will be measured and it will have impact for decades to come. And I want to thank all you governors here, and I urge you if you agree with me, and many of you do, to urge your congressional representatives to force this bill to be brought up. To prove America can be relied up on. America stands up for freedom. We never bow to anyone, particularly Putin.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:35)', 'Speech': 'Look folks, now on another important work we’re doing. I want to thank you all for delivering historic results for the American people. You’ve been incredible partners. Governors know the measure of success isn’t how many partisan points we score, it’s did we fix the problem? Did we fix the problem? We disagree on how to fix the problem many times. We’re all here for one reason, to fix the problems, to get things done for families, for communities, for the country. That’s why I kept my commitment to be President for all Americans, whether you voted for me or not. In fact, we’ve invested more in all we passed in red states than we have in blue states. That’s a fact. Billions of dollars more of it we passed was invested in red states than blue states. I came to office when the pandemic was raging and the economy was reeling, but we’ve turned things around with your help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:28)', 'Speech': 'The American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion to state and local governments, and many of you put that money up for cops on the beat bringing down violent crime across the nation, which we’ve done. To bring a half a million teachers and other school personnel back into the classrooms, to prevent foreclosures and evictions, to keep 8 million families in their homes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made the most significant investment in our nation’s infrastructure in history. Well Eisenhower’s interstate Highway Bill maybe did it as much, but over 46,000 projects already. 46,000, and we’re just getting started. It’s just the beginning. Modernizing roads, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, public transit, clean water, high-speed internet, affordable high-speed internet, everywhere. I’ve stood with Governor Evers and Walz rebuilding the Blatnik Bridge. By the way, as you know over a billion dollars. And it’s important, from Wisconsin to Minnesota. Governor Beshear and Governor DeWine, we’re building a bridge called the Brent Spence Bridge between Kentucky and Ohio. By the way, tens of thousands of trucks and commerce cross those bridges every day, and we’re finally getting it done. We’re building the nation’s first high speed rail line in California and Nevada, and I want to thank Governor Newsom for his leadership in that. And by the way, I’m not sure how many people who leave LA can do it in two hours to get there, whether they’re going to come back or not to Las Vegas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:19)', 'Speech': 'Put all kidding aside, we’re making the biggest investment ever in climate change ever. I visited your states working together to respond and build and boost resilience to extreme weather. Spent an awful lot of time, and I’m not complaining about it, I’m just pointing it out. An awful lot of time with a lot of you governors over the last three years dealing with the impacts of bad weather. I’ve flown over your states, particularly in the Southwest and the West and the Northwest for I don’t know how many times, and helicopters looking to timber burned to the ground. We’ve lost more timber, we’ve lost more forest than the entire state of Maryland makes up in land, in square miles. We’re building a cleaner, more reliable power grid, promoting clean energy and advanced manufacturing industries of the future. Made in America. Made in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:13)', 'Speech': 'One of the things that I didn’t know, maybe you knew, but I’d been around a long time in the Congress, I didn’t know when they passed the legislation relating to the right of labor to organize in the ’30s that there’s a provision that said if the Congress gives the President money to invest in America, to build things in America, to spend money in America, to spend money for America, they should do two things. One, they should hire Americans to do it, and two, they should use American products. Well guess what? Didn’t happen in Democrat or Republic administrations for the longest time? And so guess what happened? We are no longer disclosing just in factories in your states. What was happening the last 20 years in all of our states, including my state of Delaware? People were putting the business aside, labor’s cheaper overseas. So we export the factory and import the product. Well, we’re building factories here in America now, not overseas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:23)', 'Speech': 'So far my investment in America has attracted $650 billion. $650 billion in private investments, bringing factories, jobs back home to your states, and restoring a sense of pride. How many times you see people in your states had that factory work… Maybe only employed 500 to 2,000 people and for generations, people, family after family showed up and worked in that factory and all of a sudden it’s gone. It’s overseas. But now they’re coming back. They’re coming back, and with a pride is coming back. For example, I was with Governor Hochul in Syracuse, New'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:50)', 'Speech': 'I’ve signed legislation, going to cut the federal deficit by another $1 trillion over the next decade. And it’s clear we have the strongest economy in the world, and that’s not hyperbole. We have the strongest economy in the world today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:03)', 'Speech': 'Nearly 15 million new jobs created a record. Growth is strong. Ranges are strong, rising faster than prices. Inflation is down, more to do. And folks, folks are starting to feel it. Positive consumer sentiment surged 30% the last three months. The biggest jump in 30 years. We’ve got more to do. I’m not suggesting it’s done yet.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:25)', 'Speech': 'America has filed a record 16 million new business applications the vice president talked about across the country since we came to office. And with your help, every one, every one of those filings is an act of hope. Think about it. It’s an act of hope, investing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:42)', 'Speech': 'They believe they can do something and we’re just getting started. We’re going to keep fighting to lower the cost of families and everything from prescription to drugs to housing. For example, we capped insulin for seniors and Medicare $35 a month instead of as much as $400 a month. Well, let’s make that $35 available to everyone in your states. Everyone.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:09)', 'Speech': 'That, and other actions of lowering prescription drug costs are not only good for the people, they save the taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. The action on prescription drugs thus far has already reduced the deficit by another $160 billion. Hear me? $160 billion, because Medicare is not paying out 400 bucks, they’re paying out 35 bucks. Taxpayers are being saved money as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:35)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, they’re still making a profit, in some cases of 300%. Because we don’t have to pay these exorbitant prices, we’re also lowering housing costs to boost supply.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:47)', 'Speech': 'Today, with your help, we’re record 1.7 million housing units are under construction nationwide. We know we need more and I’ve sent Congress an ambitious plan to do more. I appreciate your help to get it passed. We’re partners in this work and you’ve been leading the way before us, many of you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:05)', 'Speech': 'There’s one other piece of unfinished business I want to talk about: the border. My first day in office as president, the first bill I sent, I sent up a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system. And I think you all have at your table, if I’m not mistaken, because I don’t want to take the time to go on all the detail, a fact sheet on the bipartisan border deal. And it’s titled Fact Sheet: Impact of Bipartisan Border Deal on Funding Border Operations. And it lays out all the things that it does, that compromise.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:38)', 'Speech': 'We introduced a comprehensive plan to fix the system. It included funding for high-tech border security, legal pathways for DREAMEers, addressed through causes of why so many people are fleeing to the southern border to avoid violence, corruption, political instability, natural disasters.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:55)', 'Speech': 'Folks, Congress has had a long proud history of bipartisan history and immigration reform and abiding by our international treaty obligations, which we signed relating to immigration. These reforms made America a nation of laws, a nation of immigrants, and the strongest economy in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:13)', 'Speech': 'But something changed. Over time, our laws and our resources haven’t kept up with our immigration system, and it’s broken, and our politics has failed to fix it. That’s why months ago I instructed my team to begin the series of negotiations in a bipartisan group of senators. Democrats were led by a very conservative Republican who did a hell of a job–to fix our immigration system.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:37)', 'Speech': 'I provided each of you, as I said, the fact sheet with the details of that bipartisan deal. The bipartisan agreement represents the most fair and humane reforms in the long time. I didn’t get everything I wanted in it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:51)', 'Speech': 'It also includes the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever in history. The border patrol chief himself said, “We need more people. We need more agents on the line.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:02)', 'Speech': 'Our bipartisan bill got the border patrol agents they need. It funds and hires 1,500 more agents and officers. 1005… 100 more immigration judges, 4,300 more asylum officers to get asylum decisions in months instead of years. Right now, they come through the border, an asylum. They don’t… not able to see an asylum officer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:24)', 'Speech': 'They get a bracelet and they could put in the country and they say, “Come back in seven years. Come back in seven years when we’re able to hear your case.” Provides more cutting-edge inspection machines to detect and stop fentanyl getting across the border. It funds what many of you governors need to help shelter migrants as a win for the future of the American people and a win for your states. But then as we all know, petty politics intervened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:54)', 'Speech': 'The speaker of the House has refused to vote on the bill even though, again, there’s significant support. Every Republican I’ve… Talk to your Republican colleagues. There are the votes on that floor to pass that bill. All of a sudden, people started to go silent, but they’re in a tough spot.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:14)', 'Speech': 'Tell that to the border patrol that we can’t get this done. They support this bipartisan bill. Tell that to the Chamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce, who supports that proposal. Tell that to the Wall Street Journal editorial page that supports this. There are governors in this room who support it. Strong minorities oppose it, but a significant majority in the House and Senate support it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:39)', 'Speech': 'Folks, doing nothing is not an option. Compromise is part of the process. I didn’t get everything I wanted in that deal. We didn’t deal with DREAMEers, we didn’t do a number of things I think we should do. But you know, it’s a positive step, a significant step. You know that. You deal with this every day. Some of you deal with it every single day.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:01)', 'Speech': 'You have real skin in the game. So if this matters to you, it matters to your state, tell your members of Congress who are stand in the way. Show a little spine, pass the bipartisan security bill, notwithstanding you may reap the wrath of one or more of your colleagues.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:17)', 'Speech': 'Look, it’s the strongest border deal our country has ever seen.

Let’s get it done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:28)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, speak to your agricultural communities and ask them if they need temporary workers. Why are we making the kinds of progress we’re making economically when the rest of the world is in a standstill in agriculture, basically?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:43)', 'Speech': 'Look, let’s keep working to fix the entire system. I hope you all can help.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:48)', 'Speech': 'Let me close to this: I appreciate Governor Cox’s effort to make the mission of the NGA, to get those of us who disagree with one another to listen to one another, to treat one another with a sense of dignity and respect. That’s what you guys do. And women do more than most. That’s essential part of America. That’s how we get things done.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:10)', 'Speech': 'That’s how democracy works. When it works, it needs to be able to have that kind of exchange. And when folks in your state look around and see more factories coming in, more shovels in the ground, more people going to work, more access to affordable internet, I hope they feel the pride, the pride in their hometowns, making a comeback. The pride in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:34)', 'Speech': 'Folks, I know some people think I am a little too optimistic.

The potential for a ceasefire in Gaza is a big deal, because of what we have seen during this war. The negotiations now that have gone on for weeks, varying levels of optimism over whether they would actually come through, and now this news from the President. To be clear, we don’t have many more details or any more details other than what the President himself has said, like how long it could last, what it would look like, because just today, the Israeli Minister of Defense pledged that even if Israel does agree to a temporary ceasefire, it’ll keep fighting until all the hostages are freed. I want to bring in Aaron Gilchrist, who is live for us at the White House here. And Aaron, listen, this is the President very publicly choosing to lay down this marker, this timeline for when he thinks there could be this significant development with the ceasefire. Talk us through it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:30)', 'Speech': 'Prime Minister Netanyahu said on television yesterday that he felt like Hamas was being unrealistic, to put it nicely, in some of the things that it was demanding. And so he wasn’t saying for certain that this is a deal that would come together, but we did get indications from the President’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, that the contours were in place and that the work was still going to be happening, continuing to happen, to hammer out the final details of a deal, and to see something come together that would allow for a pause in the fighting, an extended pause in the fighting. There had been talk about the potential for six weeks of a pause in some of the fighting, and of course a release of hostages and an effort to get more aid, food, medicine, and things of that sort into Gaza, to people who’ve been suffering for months now, the Palestinians there who’ve been suffering for months now, while this war has been going on. And so this first sign, Hallie, as you said, an indication that we could be in the final days of a deal coming together, as the President said possibly by the end of the weekend.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:55)', 'Speech': 'Netanyahu though, for his part, said that if a deal does come together, it would delay any military movement into Rafah. And so, there’s a lot of hope around the world, and certainly with all the parties, the countries that have been engaged in this negotiation process, that they will be able to come to some agreement on a ceasefire, that there will be an effort to help civilians who have been suffering so badly over these many months, and potentially this could be the beginning of additional conversations that could lead to a more extensive ceasefire, potentially even an end to some of the fighting.

Today also, we’re going to discuss the Middle East and yesterday’s tragic and alarming event in North Gaza, trying to get humanitarian assistance in there. And the loss of life is heartbreaking. People are so desperate that innocent people got caught in a terrible war, unable to feed their families. And you saw the response when they tried to get aid in. And we need to do more and the United States will do more. In the coming days we’re going to join with our friends in Jordan and others, in providing airdrops of additional food and supplies into Ukraine, and seek to continue to open up other avenues into Ukraine, including the possibility of a Marine charter delivering large amounts of humanitarian assistance.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:53)', 'Speech': 'In addition to expanding deliveries by land, as I said, we’re going to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more route to get more and more people the help they need. No excuses because the truth is aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now. It’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line and children’s lives are on the line. We won’t stand by until we get more aid in there. We should be getting hundreds of trucks in, not just several. And I won’t stand by, we won’t let up, and we’re not going to pull out. Pull out every stop we can to get more assistance in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:39)', 'Speech': 'And here’s the deal. We’ve been working, and hopefully we’ll know shortly, and I know you’ve been informed, we’re trying to work out a deal between Israel and Hamas, the hostages being returned, and immediate ceasefire in Gaza for at least the next six weeks. And to allow the surge of aid to the entire Gaza Strip, not just the South, but the entire Gaza Strip. And so Giorgia, we have a lot to discuss today, and then we’ll talk about everything from China on. But I’m happy you’re here and delighted to that you came back. I know you’re on your way to Canada, right?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:59)', 'Speech': 'EU Operation [inaudible 00:05:02] as you know, is under Italian tactical command, is an important response to the disruption or transit through the Red Sea. Then building on Italy’s role in the Mediterranean, the G7 will pay special attention also to the African continent. We’ve been discussing it for many times, but I think we have to remember that Africa is not a poor continent. It is, at the contrary, incredibly rich in human and material resources, but it has been neglected and exploited with a predatory approach for a long time. And I want to reverse this approach to together with you, which is also a root cause of the migration crisis. We need to support Africa’s development on an equal basis and put an end to illegal migration while fighting human trafficking. Human trafficking has become the most financially rewarding crime globally, and we cannot accept it any longer. For this reason I came here today also with a proposal to launch a global alliance against human traffickers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:14)', 'Speech': 'The G7 will discuss artificial intelligence as well. AI is a means. It can be a good or a bad one. It depends on our capacity to govern it, to tackle the risks and the impact it can have, for example, on the labor market. We want to develop AI, but also we want to be certain that it remains human-centered.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:38)', 'Speech': 'And then last but not least, I came here to boost our strategic cooperation and our relations are enriched by the presence of more than 20 million Italian Americans. During our last meeting here in Washington, we said we wanted to improve our bilateral cooperation and our trade. And we did it. For in 2023, our bilateral trade reached the highest amount ever with $102 billion of exchange. So I think we did a good job, but I also think that we can do even better. And I hope this will be our mutual goal for this year. Thank you, Joe.'}]"

Look, the good news is inflation is the lowest it’s been in three years and last year alone, inflation came down by two thirds. We have one of the lowest inflation rates in the world. Many companies have done the right thing. They’ve helped lower costs for Americans, but even as supply chains are back to normal, some companies are still not passing along their savings to their customers. Many corporations are raising their prices, pad the profits, charging folks more and more for less and less. But in fact, some of the small snack companies, think you won’t even notice what they’re doing. And when they charge you just as much for the same size bag of potato chips, only it has a hell of a lot fewer chips in it. I’ll tell you who did notice. The cookie monster. He pointed out his cookies are getting smaller, paying the same price. I was stunned when I found out that actually happened.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:05)', 'Speech': 'But some companies are also adding junk fees. The hidden costs that are added to your bill without your knowledge. And some companies have been even caught breaking the law while overcharging consumers and the American people are tired of being played for suckers. I mean, it’s one thing no matter how much money you make, no matter how rich or poor or middle class are, you don’t like being taken advantage of. That’s why today I’m launching a new strike force on unfair and illegal pricing. To crack down on companies who break the law while keeping prices high for American consumers. The new strike force will be led by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. If you keep prices high while engaging in illegal practices that are fraudulent or unfair or deceptive or anti-competitive, we will enforce the law. We will enforce the law.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:55)', 'Speech': 'Today we’re announcing that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is finalizing a rule that will help stop some credit card companies from ripping you off with late fees. Under the law, banks are not supposed to charge late fees that are higher than the cost banks that have to engage to collect the late payment, but we estimate banks are generating five times more in late fees than it costs to collect late payments. They’re padding their profit margins and charging hardworking Americans more than a cumulative effort, a number, $14 billion in 2022. With the announcement of this new rule, late fees are now going down to $8, $8. Instead of the current average of $32 late fee payments. This action will collectively save families $10 billion in credit card late fees every year. That’s the average of $220 in savings annually for more than 45 million Americans who typically have to pay late fees. That’s a lot of money.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:03)', 'Speech': 'And let me close with this. Fair competition is the key to my economic vision. To build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, and it’s working. Wages are up more than prices. Unemployment has reached historic lows. Families are finally getting a little breathing room. Prices are still too high and they shouldn’t be this high. That’s why we’re going to do everything we can to keep lowering costs for hardworking families. With that, I’m going to turn this over to Lael, the Director of National Economic Council, but I’m supposed to leave for a meeting with the Business Roundtable on the telephone, but I’m going to hang around and listen to it. So with your permission, I’d like to stay and my staff will tell me when the drop dead hour occurs, pass me a note.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:52)', 'Speech': 'But thank you all for all the work you’re doing. I really mean it. It makes a big difference. When I raised this issue a year or so ago with some of my team, they thought no one’s going to care much about it. Well, they didn’t sit at my kitchen table when I was growing up. I care a whole lot when you’re being played for a sucker no matter how much money you have. So thank you for what you’re doing. Lael, I’ll turn it over to you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:51)', 'Speech': 'As you can see from, there will be a slide in the slide deck. We’re also working hard at two more proposed rules. One tackles unfair and deceptive practices in poultry tournaments. The second reaffirms the longstanding position of USDA that harmed a competition along the lines of the Sherman and Clayton Acts should not be applied to backers and stockyard cases. We’re very close to publishing a final rule that aligns the product of the USA label with consumer understanding of what that claim means. We’re working on label standards and verification guidance for claims such as animal raised practices so that consumers can trust those labels. And lastly, we’re wrapping up the more than one billion dollars of investments that you challenged us to make in meat and poultry processing infrastructure this spring and summer, focused on small, independently-owned local facilities.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:43)', 'Speech': 'I’d like to highlight the steps we continue to take to promote transparency, the farmer’s voice and research access with the partnership of the United States Patent and Trade Office, we’re also helping farmers and plant breeders voice their expertise in support of robust patent examination process. Next, in partnership with the Patent Office, we’re working on steps to promote research access to seed [inaudible 00:08:07]. All of this Mr. President, is going to provide additional competition, more choice and lower costs for consumers. And that’s just a few of the many ways we’re promoting competition at USDA from domestic and sustainable fertilizer capacity, which you ordered, to food system transformations and more. USDA is using our expertise in balance sheet to bring down prices for consumers, promote fairness for farmers and workers with the Department of Justice and shoring up the resiliency in our food and agriculture supply chain, all of which you directed and challenged us to do.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:14)', 'Speech': 'Now, Putin’s ongoing assault on Ukraine has underscored how important this is. Our security assistance has kept the Ukrainians in the fight and saved lives, and it’s also strengthened our economy. These investments have expanded facilities and created jobs for American workers. And the weapons that we’ve sent to Ukraine to help defend itself are made in America by American workers nationwide, from Texas to Ohio, to Arizona. Now Ukraine’s fight also shows that we urgently need to expand our own production capabilities and coordinate even more closely with our partners and allies. And we need Congress to pass the national security supplemental and the full year appropriations so that we can keep investing in our industrial base. And I appreciate everyone here and your support to make the President’s executive order a reality. These initiatives will promote competition and revitalize our defense industrial base to keep America safe in the 21st century. Thanks.'}]"

Now, it’s we who face unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln in the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today. What makes our moment rare is the freedom and democracy are under attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:39)', 'Speech': 'Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not. But Ukraine, Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all. That is all Ukraine is asking. They’re not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers in the war in Ukraine and I’m determined to keep it that way. But now, assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. I wasn’t a long ago when a Republican president named Ronald Reagan thundered, “Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:58)', 'Speech': 'Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, “Do whatever the hell you want.” That’s a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to a Russian leader, I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable. America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of Democratic nations created after World War II to prevent world war and keep the peace. And today, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning, Sweden officially joined and their minister is here tonight. Stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen. I say this to Congress, we have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm. My message to President Putin who I’ve known for a long time is simple, “We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.” In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching just like history watched three years ago on January 6th when insurrectionists stormed this very Capital and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:39)', 'Speech': 'Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They’ve come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people. January 6th and lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed the gravest threat to US democracy since the Civil War. But they failed, America stood. America stood strong and democracy prevailed. We must be honest, the threat to democracy must be defended. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th. I will not do that. This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here’s the simple truth: you can’t love your country only when you win. As I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember, your oath of office is defending against all threats, foreign and domestic. Respect, respect free and fair elections. Restore trust in our institutions and make clear, political violence has absolutely no place, no place in America, zero place. Again, it’s not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. We’re watching it. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do. History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait. What her family had got through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again. So tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle, don’t keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:34)', 'Speech': 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom, and so much more. Thank you. My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He’s the reason it was overturned and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted. Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She’s become pregnant again and had a fetus of a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get what she needed. What her family got through should have never happened as well but it’s happening in to many others.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:52)', 'Speech': 'There are state laws banning the freedom to choose. Criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states to get the treatment they need. Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My god, what freedoms would you take away? Look, in its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following, and with all due respect, justices, “Women are not without electoral or political power.” You’re about to realize just how much you can brag about that.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:52)', 'Speech': 'Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2020 and we win again in 2024. If you, the American people, send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I’ll restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. Folks, America cannot go back. I’m here tonight to show what I believe the way forward because I know how far we’ve come. Four years ago, next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in the century.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:56)', 'Speech': 'Remember, the fear? Record losses? Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate, raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind, a mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness? A president, my predecessor, failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care. I think that’s unforgivable. I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the nation’s history we have. It doesn’t make news but in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (39:46)', 'Speech': 'So let’s tell the story here, tell it here and now. America’s comeback is building the future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Investing in all America and all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind. The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback, that’s what America does. That’s what America does.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (40:22)', 'Speech': 'Folks, my inherited economy is on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world. 15 million new jobs in just three years, a record. Unemployment, at 50-year low. A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is a literal act of hope with historic job growth and small business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian-Americans. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. Where is it written we can’t be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are and we will.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:21)', 'Speech': 'More people have health insurance today than ever before. The racial wealth gap is as small as it’s been in 20 years. Wages keep going up, inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3%, the lowest in the world and tending lower. The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs right here in America where they belong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:56)', 'Speech': 'And it takes time but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. Buy America, has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor, including some Democrats as well in the past, failed to buy American. Not anymore. On my watch, federal projects that you fund, like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways will be made with American products and built by American workers. Good paying American jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (42:45)', 'Speech': 'And thanks to our Chips and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cellphones to automobiles. And by the way, we invented those chips right here in America. Well, instead of having to import them, instead, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs. Many of those jobs paying a $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (43:25)', 'Speech': 'In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have announced all across your communities. And by the way, I noticed some of you strongly voted against it or they’re cheering on that money coming in. I like it. I’m with you. I’m with you. If any of you don’t want that money in your district, just let me know.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (44:23)', 'Speech': 'Modernize that roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems. Removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage. Providing affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where you live: urban, suburban, or rural communities, in red states and blue states. Record investments in tribal communities. Because I invested in the family farm, led by my Secretary of Agriculture who knows more about this than anybody I know, we’re better able to stay in the family farms and their children or grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living. It’s transformative.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (45:15)', 'Speech': 'The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois, home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading. Then, I was elected to the office and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded. Instead of auto factory shutting down, auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power of those cars there at the same… To the folks at Belvidere, I say, “Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building the future in Belvidere right here in America.” Here tonight, the UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up. And Dawn Sim, a third generation UAW worker at Belvidere. Shawn, I was proud to be the first president to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well. Showing once again, Wall Street didn’t build America. They’re not bad guys, they didn’t build it though. The middle class built the country and unions built the middle class. I say to the American people, when America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That’s America. That’s you, the American people. It’s because of you America is coming back. It’s because of you our future is bright. It’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say, “The state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.” Tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get all the tax breaks. And by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a state that has more corporations invested than every one of your states in the United States combined and I represented it for 36 years. I’m not anti-corporation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (48:48)', 'Speech': 'But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn’t put much on my dad’s kitchen table, that’s why I’m determined to turn things around so middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. And there’s more to do to make sure you’re feeling the benefits of all we’re doing. Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It’s wrong and I’m ending it. With a law that I proposed and signed, and not one of your Republican buddies voted for it, we finally beat big pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin, with diabetes, and it only costs 10 bucks to make, they only get paid 35 a month now and still make healthy profit. And I want a… What to do next? I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (50:39)', 'Speech': 'This year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It’s now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.They’re making a lot of money, guys, and they’ll still be extremely profitable. Will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:13)', 'Speech': 'Starting next year that same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone. Folks, I’m going to get in trouble for saying that, but [inaudible 00:51:42], Berlin, Moscow … Excuse me, well, even Moscow, probably. Bring your prescription with you and I promise you I’ll get it for you for 40% the cost you’re paying now. Same company, same drug, same place. Folks, the Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare, it’s still a very big deal. Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing condition, but my predecessor, and many in this chamber, want to take that protection drug away by repealing the Affordable Care Act. I’m not going to let that happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:45)', 'Speech': 'We stopped you 50 times before and we will stop you again. In fact, I’m not only protecting it, I’m expanding it. The enacted tax credits save $800 per person per year, reduced health care cost for millions of working families. That tax credit expire next year. I want to make that savings permanent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (53:10)', 'Speech': 'To state the obvious, women are more than half our population, but research on women’s health has always been underfunded.

Inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that, but I’m not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Just for two years. My administration is also eliminating title insurance on federally-backed mortgages. When you refinance your home you can save you $1,000 or more as a consequence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:46)', 'Speech': 'For millions of renters, we’re cracking down on big landlords use antitrust … Who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (54:58)', 'Speech': 'We’ve cut red tape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million housing units nationwide.

I asked them what they need most, the CEOs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (57:05)', 'Speech': 'You’ve had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say a better educated workforce, right?

DuPont used to be the eighth-largest corporation in the world, and every new enterprise they bought they educated the workforce to that enterprise, but none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?” They all looked at me and said, “I think you’re right.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (57:37)', 'Speech': 'I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade.

A fair tax code is how we invest things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and more, but here’s the deal, the last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, overwhelmingly benefit the topping 1%, the very wealthy, the biggest corporation, and exploded the federal deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:00:58)', 'Speech': 'They added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history.

I don’t think any of you think there’s no longer a climate crisis, at least I hope you don’t. I’m taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world. I’m cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030, creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs like the IBEW work is building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. Conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030 and taking action on environmental justice. Fence-lined communities smothered by the legacy of pollution. And patterned after the Peace Corps in AmeriCorps, I launched the Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work in the forefront of our clean energy future. I’ll triple that number in a decade.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:17:21)', 'Speech': 'To state the obvious, all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe, and America is safer today then when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up 30%. 30% they went up, the biggest increase in history. It was then through my American Rescue Plan, which every Republican voted against, I might add, we made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, the murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years, but we have more to do. We have to help cities invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, more community violence intervention. Give communities the tool to crack down on gun crime, retail crime and carjacking. Keep building trust as I’ve been doing by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land. Directing my cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana and expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record. Take on crimes of domestic violence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:18:56)', 'Speech': 'I’m ramping up the federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act that I proudly wrote when I was a senator, so we can finally, finally end the scourge against women in America. There are other kinds of violence I want to stop. With us tonight is Jasmine whose 9-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers in elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. Very soon after that happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde for a couple days. We spent hours and hours with each of the families. We heard their message so everyone in this room, in this chamber could hear the same message, the constant refrain. And I was there for hours meeting with every family. They said, “Do something. Do something.” Well, I did do something by establishing the first ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House that the vice president is leading the charge. Thank you for doing it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:20:15)', 'Speech': 'Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president. After another shooting in Iowa recently, when asked what to do about it, he said, “Just get over it.” There was his quote, “Just get over it.” I say stop it. Stop it, stop it, stop it. I’m proud we beat the NRA when I signed most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress. We now must beat the NRA again. I’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Pass universal background checks. None of this, none of this… I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:21:20)', 'Speech': 'As we manage challenges at home, we’re also managing crises abroad, including in the Middle East. I know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people, for the Israeli people, for the Palestinian people and so many here in America. This crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas as you all know. 1,200 innocent people, women and girls, men and boys, slaughtered after enduring sexual violence. The deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and 250 hostages taken. Here in this chamber tonight are families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home. We also will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul, Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians and others around the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:22:38)', 'Speech': 'Israel has the right to go after Hamas. Hamas ended this conflict by releasing hostages, laying down arms… Could end it by releasing the hostages, laying down arms and surrendering those responsible for October 7th. But Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards under hospitals, daycare centers and all the like. Israel also has a fundamental responsibility though to protect innocent civilians in Gaza. This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas. Thousands and thousands of innocent women and children, girls and boys also orphaned. Nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement. Homes destroyed, neighbors in rubble, cities in ruin, families without food, water, medicine. It’s heartbreaking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:23:55)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been working nonstop to establish immediate cease fire that would last for six weeks to get all the prisoners released, all the hostages released, to get the hostages home and ease the intolerable and humanitarian crisis and build toward something more enduring. The United States have been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Tonight, I’m directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters. No US boots will be on the ground. A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting in Gaza every day. And Israel must do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the crossfire. They’re announcing they’re going to have a crossing in Northern Gaza.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:25:06)', 'Speech': 'To the leadership of Israel, I say this, humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority. As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I’m the only American president of Israel in wartime, but there is no other path that guarantees Israel’s security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees Palestinian can live in peace with peace and dignity. And there’s no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia with whom I’m talking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:26:08)', 'Speech': 'Creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran. That’s why I build a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. I’ve ordered strikes to degrade the Houthis capability and defend US forces in the region. As commander in chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel. For years, I’ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise, and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backwards. I’ve been saying it for over four years, even when I wasn’t president. America is rising. We have the best economy in the world, and since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade. And we’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:27:19)', 'Speech': 'I revitalized our partnership and alliance in the Pacific. India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Pacific Islands. I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China, not allowing to trade them there. Frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. I want competition with China, not conflict. And we’re in a stronger position to win the conflict of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter, than any time as well. Here at home, I’ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills. There’s more to pass my unity agenda. Strength and penalties on fentanyl trafficking. You don’t want to do that, huh? Pass bipartisan privacy that says to protect our children online, harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril, ban AI voice impersonations and more. And keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don’t.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:28:40)', 'Speech': 'That’s why the strong support and help of Denis and the VA, I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever helping millions of veterans exposed to a toxin who now are battling more than 100 different cases. Many of them don’t come home, but we owe them and their families support. We owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H and remind us that we can do big things like end cancer as we know it, and we will. Let me close with this. I know you don’t want to hear any more, Lindsay, but I got to say a few more things. I know it may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while. When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story. Again and again, I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that defined America. Honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair chance, to give hate no safe harbor. Now other people my age see it differently. The American story of resentment, revenge and retribution, that’s not me. I was born amid World War II when America stood for the freedom of the world. I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware among working class people who built this country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:31:03)', 'Speech': 'I watched in horror as two of my heroes, like many of you did, Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. And their legacy inspired me to pursue a career in service. I left the law firm, became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots. And I became a county councilman almost by accident. I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running at age 29. Then vice president of our first black president. Now a president to the first woman vice president. In my career, I’ve been told I was too young. By the way, they can let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. Not a joke. And I’ve been told I’m too old. Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures. I’ve known our North Star.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:32:24)', 'Speech': 'The very idea of America that we’re all created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives, we’ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either. And I won’t walk away from it now. I’m optimistic. I really am. I’m optimistic, Nancy. My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are. It’s how old are our ideas. Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas, but you can’t lead America with ancient ideas. Only take us back. You lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done. Tonight, you’ve heard mine.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:33:25)', 'Speech': 'I see a future we’re defending democracy. You don’t diminish it. I see a future where we’ll restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot, and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. Above all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans, and I’ll always be president for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. You’re the reason we’ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am now. So let’s build the future together. Let’s remember who we are.

I was so proud of him. He gave such a strong speech, and set out a clear vision of where we’ve been and where we’re going. It’s great to be home. As most of you know, I’m a Philly girl. I grew up in Willow Grove, just north of the city, and probably like most of you, I spent my summers watching the Phillies with my dad. Of course, in the fall, we were always watching football, and the Eagles. Yes. Speaking of the Eagles, can we give Jason Kelce a round of applause? We’re going to miss him, aren’t we? Last night, Joe showed the world what I see every day. It’s what drew me to him when we first met, I think, honest to God, Joe, 50 years ago. At that time, he was a heartbroken father who had endured unspeakable tragedy, but he was keeping it together for our family. The senator who put one foot in front of the other because he knew his constituents were counting on him. The man who placed his faith in a power greater than himself, because when you go through that type of pain, there’s no choice but to recognize your powerlessness in the face of God’s providence. Joe rebuilt our family with compassion, love and strength, and as your president, he’s rebuilt our nation with that same character. Joe knows how serious the stakes are in this election. Courts that are stripping away our most basic freedoms, MAGA Republicans that are trying to drag us back to a dark and dangerous place, extremists waging battles over our bodies, our choices, and our futures. We are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:24)', 'Speech': 'Joe is working tirelessly to defend our freedoms, our future, and our democracy. I wouldn’t wish the tragic events of the last several months on any American president, but I’m so grateful that Joe is our president during these uncertain, tumultuous times. He isn’t just the right person for this job. He is the only person for this job. Joe wakes up every morning thinking about how he can make the lives of Americans better. Donald Trump wakes up every morning caring about one person and one person only: himself. He tears people down and pits us against one another. He mocks women’s bodies and devalues our existence.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:41)', 'Speech': 'Here’s the one thing that really gets my Philly up. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, Navy veteran, and the mother of an army soldier, Donald Trump insults our veterans and disparages those who died in war, calling them losers and suckers. How dare he? Donald Trump is dangerous to women and to our families, and to our country, and we can’t let him win. We can’t wake up the day after the election like we did in 2016, terrified of the future ahead of us, thinking, “Oh my God, what just happened? What are we going to do now?” No, we must meet this moment as if our rights are at stake, because they are; as if our democracy is on the line, because it is. We must reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and that starts here in this room, with all of you.

That’s a record in American history, unemployment in a 50-year low, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs and counting.

For example, Americans pay more as a pharmacist can tell us, a doc can tell us for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It’s wrong. And I’ve been fighting the pharmaceutical industry since I was in the Senate for over 30 years. But guess what? We’re ending it. The law I proposed and signed, no one, not one Republican voted for it, but we finally beat big pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month, for example, on insulin for seniors, they only have to pay 35 bucks. And by the way, it only costs $10 to make. They’re still paying, they’re still getting a big profit. Well, look, I’m not stopping there.

This doesn’t just save seniors money, it’s saving taxpayers billions of dollars, cutting the deficit. Now it’s time to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs. It’s going to save the taxpayers another $200 billion, we already saved $160 billion off your taxes because Medicare doesn’t have to pay that bill. Folks, starting next year, the bill I got passed, we’re capping the total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, 14, 15,000 a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:07)', 'Speech': 'And my goal next year, let’s do that for all of America.

But it’s not going to happen on my watch.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:52)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’m also working to bring down the cost of housing. I’m proposing an annual tax trade that will give Americans $ 400 a month over the next 2 years to put toward their mortgage if they are buying for the first home, or if in fact they’re moving to a larger place because they’re afraid they’re going to lose the mortgage rate they have. But guess what? But I can’t guarantee it. But I bet you, I bet you those rates come down more because I bet you that that little outfit that sets interest rates, it’s going to come down. It’s going to come down. Folks, we’re cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents. Now, Congress need to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and apartments and bring those rents down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:52)', 'Speech': 'By the way, [inaudible 00:15:56], that’s cost a lot of money raising the deficit. Guess what? We cut the deficit, we cut the deficit. $1 trillion. The last guy ballooned the deficit. We passed the budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. They kept trying to get out of it, but they finally agreed. And now it’s my goal to cut the federal deficit by 3 trillion more by making big corporations very wealthy. And I’m a capitalist man [inaudible 00:16:27]. You can go make a million bucks, make a billion, good for you, but pay your taxes. We have 1,000 billionaires in America, 1,000. Guess how much, what their tax rate is? 8.3%. Anybody want to change the tax rate with them? Think about that. 8.3%. Billionaire Donald Trump. You sure as hell do? Look, Donald Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut when he was president, overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and exploded the federal deficit, exploded it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:16)', 'Speech': 'We cut the deficit and we added more to the national debt than any president in his term in all of history, and under Donald Trump. These guys talk about, oh … Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits charging you more and more for less and less. That’s why we’re cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing. Looks like companies that you wouldn’t notice, they thought you wouldn’t notice, but if they give you the same size bag of potato chips with about 20% fewer potato chips. No, by the way, that’s not a joke. Some of you may have seen, there was a TV thing on how Snickers bars,'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:23)', 'Speech': 'I’m also getting junk fees for those hidden fees added at the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we’re cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8. By the way, I’m not being arbitrary. The law says they can charge for late fees what it costs them to collect it. It does not cost anywhere near $32, but they make, over time, over that period, billions of dollars. Literally, it stunned me. You got 450,000 people paying those late fees, and they charge… They end up paying over $2 billion. The banks and credit card companies don’t like it. Why? I’m saving American families $20 billion a year with those junk fees by eliminating them. 20 billion.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:14)', 'Speech': 'And by the way, I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, they’re the two places I grew up. And you know what? It made a difference in my household if you had to pay an extra 50 bucks a month, a hundred bucks a month for things. It wasn’t fair. It matters, and so does this. Folks, does anybody think the tax code is fair?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:05)', 'Speech': 'Big corporations will finally have to begin to pay their fair share. No, really, this is just fairness. It’s about fairness and decency. We’re not making this stuff up. In 2020, you may remember this was a big fight I had with the Republicans. In 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion in profit and paid zero in federal taxes. Well, I was determined to change that. And guess what? Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15%. It’s only 15%. It’s still less than working people pay in federal taxes. This time we’re going to raise the minimum tax to corporations at least 21%. And so every billion-dollar corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:09)', 'Speech': 'Look, I want to end tax breaks for big pharma, big oil, corporate jets, massive executive pay that gets deducted. Look, as I said, there are a thousand billionaires in America and their federal tax rate is 8.2%. I said three before. That’s far less than the vast majority of you pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse. That’s why I proposed, not the highest tax, the minimum tax of 25% for billionaires, just 25. And guess what? Know how much money that would raise over the next 10 years? $500 billion. And imagine what that could do for America and for our future. It could cut the deficit, it could provide for child care. There’s so much that we need to do and not raise the deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:11)', 'Speech': 'Let’s invest and let’s continue to invest in the future by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don’t know, since I’ve been president, I’ve gone with all the folks from my administration, I’ve flown over those wildfires out west and in the northwest and the southwest, literally in a helicopter, all of them. And guess what? It’s burned down more timber and more housing than what comprises the entire state of Maryland. We’re taking the most significant action of climate ever in the history of the world. They said I couldn’t get it passed. We got $369 billion passed for climate change and still cut the deficit'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:08)', 'Speech': 'And America’s safer today when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up to 30% nationwide, the biggest increase in American history under the last guy. And now, through the American Rescue Plan, which every Republican voted against, I might add, I made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years. I’m ramping up federal enforcement for the Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly wrote so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:54)', 'Speech': 'These guys fought taking away guns from domestic abusers. I don’t know where they… We beat the NRA when I proposed and signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. Now we have to beat NRA again. I’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I did it once. And pass universal background checks, repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers… Look, imagine if tobacco had the same limitations companies that gun manufacturers. The only major industry in America you cannot sue is gun manufacturers. Think about that. Imagine if that had been the case with tobacco how many more people would be dying of cancer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:55)', 'Speech': 'Look, there’s a lot more to say, but I’m keeping you standing too long.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:46)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. I know you’re thinking that I couldn’t have been around very long. When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever before.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:47)', 'Speech': 'Because the soul of the country is who we are. Look, did you ever think, those of you who are over 40, did you ever think we’d be in a situation where we talk to each other like we talk these days? Why you see things that we see that no matter how tense things were, they were really tough in other parts of our history. Where you ride down the street and there was a Trump banner with an FU on it and a six-year-old kid putting up his middle finger. Did you ever see, no, I’m serious. Did you ever think you’d hear people talk the way they do? It demeans who we are. That’s not America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:33)', 'Speech': 'Those between, look, those of us who want to pull America back into the past and those who want to move into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future. I mean it sincerely. Freedom, democracy, a future based on the core values that have defined America. Honesty, decency, fairness, equality. Just treating people just fairly. No, I really mean it. We don’t always live up, but that’s the American creed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:05)', 'Speech': 'Donald Trump sees the story differently. He sees a story of resentment, revenge, retribution. I’ve been working like hell to unite Europe, NATO, and make sure Ukraine doesn’t get crushed by this dictator in Russia.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:25)', 'Speech': 'You know, the fact is that you have a president who literally has invited Putin to do what it wants, do what the hell it wants. It could come into Ukraine. He thinks Putin is a strong, basically decent guy. You know who he’s meeting with today down in Mar-a-Lago? Orbán of Hungary. Who stated flatly he doesn’t think democracy works, he’s looking for dictatorship. Only member of NATO. That’s who he’s meeting with. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:13)', 'Speech': 'I see a future where defend our freedom, not take them away. I see a future of the middle class has a fair shot and the wealthy pay their fair share. I see a future for the planet move from the climate crisis in our country and away from the gun violence that we have so much. I see a future America remains the beacon of the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:40)', 'Speech': 'I’ve been doing foreign policy since I was a kid in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I’ve gone now, I spent over almost 200 hours with the leaders of Europe, the heads of state. I know them all. I’ve known them well. Guess what? You know what every one of them says to me virtually except Orbán? I’m serious. As we leave these meetings, well indirectly, they grab my arm and they pull me aside. I’m serious. They pull me aside and say, he can’t win again because my democracy, I mean their country, my democracy is at stake. My democracy is at stake.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:19)', 'Speech': 'Folks, above all, I see a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans, a presidency for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to be here. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:57)', 'Speech': 'By the way, she talked about how she fell in love with me. I had to ask this woman five times to marry me. Five. Finally, the fifth time I was down in South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela when I was a senator. I came back to her apartment in Wilmington, Delaware, and I got off the plane. I knocked on the door. I said, Jill, you got my Irish up. I’m asking you one more time. Only one more time. Not when, but will you marry me? She goes like this, okay. I’ll tell you what. She did it. Married a Philly girl.'}]"

Rose, you’re not alone. I’m thinking about millions of Americans out there who are lying in bed at night staring at the ceiling wondering, “What if it happens? What if it happens to me? How am I going to pay for it? How will I do it?” Mothers and fathers wondering if their children come down with a chronic disease, how are they going to deal with it? Not a joke. You’re going to have to sell the house, you’re going to have to mortgage. What are you going to have to do? It’s consequential. Can you afford the medical bills?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:38)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, as I said in my State of the Union, I’m doing everything I can to lower healthcare costs to provide people peace of mind, not at the expense of doctors or medicine or hospitals or drug companies, just to make it fair. Look, and we’re so lucky to have a great congressional delegation including, without hyperbole, two of the best senators in the United States Senate I’ve ever served with. Maggie Hassan. Stand up, Maggie. And Jeanne Shaheen couldn’t make it today, but she’s a dear, dear friend and a great ally, but she sent somebody who if I have to be in a fight, I want in my corner. Stand up pal. Billy, Billy Shaheen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:20)', 'Speech': 'Look, I’m here to actually talk about the budget I released today that would, what I think, help in a big way. As you just heard, Rose, many have heard her say, many Americans pay for prescription drugs more money than anywhere in the country. If I got you on Air Force One with me and flew you to Toronto, to Berlin, to London, to Rome, any place in the world with the same prescription you might have for whatever you need, no matter what it is, and by the same company, you can get it in all those cities. And guess what? It costs you between 40% and 60% less. That’s a fact. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. That’s wrong. And guess what? I’ve been trying for years and years as a US Senator to end it and I’m ending it now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:27)', 'Speech': 'Through the Inflation Reduction Act, the law I proposed and signed, not one Republican I might add voted for, we finally beat big pharma. Caps total prescription drug costs received through Medicare at $2,000 a year even for expensive drugs. Maximum. Right now, for example, this has already passed. I got it passed already. We got it passed that beginning next year, at the end of this term, what’s going to happen is the cost for all of the prescription drugs from seniors, including the cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, 15,000 bucks a year will not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, period.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:12)', 'Speech': 'I worked with Maggie and Jeanne, “I want to cap prescription drug costs to $2,000 a year for roads and for everyone, not just seniors.” It could be transformational. But that’s not all. Instead of paying as much as 400 bucks a month for insulin for seniors with diabetes, you now only have to pay 35 bucks a month. Well, you know why we did that? I’ve been fighting that a long time too. I bet everyone knows somebody who needs insulin for diabetes. Yourself or somebody else. Well it costs as much as 400 a month. Do you know how much it costs to make that? $10. T-E-N, 10. $10.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:41)', 'Speech': 'And the guy who came up with it, he didn’t want to patent it because he wanted to make sure everybody had access to it. So if you add everything, including the cost of packaging, it’s 13 bucks. They’re still making three times more than they would ordinarily. They’re not getting cheated. They’re just going to pay what other people pay around the world. And now with Jeanne’s leadership and Maggie’s partnership, that’s not the entire delegation that’s here, I want to cap the cost of insulin to 35 bucks for every American. Every American.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:08)', 'Speech': 'On the first try to pass, it included all Americans and we got it reauthorized. The other team wouldn’t do it, so only for seniors. Look, for years people talked about this, but we finally got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prescription costs, just like the VA’s been able to do for veterans for a long, long time. It’s not just saving seniors money, it’s saving every taxpayer money. It’s cutting the federal deficit. That’s what we’ve just done so far. Cut the federal deficit over time by $160 billion. That’s $160 billion Medicare does not have to pay out because they’re paying a rational price for this drug, not just this exorbitant price from before.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:01)', 'Speech': 'Look, this year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs in the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. That’s in the law that we’ve already passed. Now it’s time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs over the next decade. Folks, if we’re able to do that, it will not only save lives, we’re going to save taxpayers another estimated $200 billion. $200 billion taxpayers will not have to pay the drug companies for exorbitant prices that aren’t [inaudible 00:06:31].'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:30)', 'Speech': 'Folks, with Maggie and your delegation’s help, I’ve already cut the federal deficit by $1 trillion, signed a bipartisan budget deal and cut another trillion dollars over the next decade, if they stick with the deal. And now it’s my goal to cut the federal debt even more by banking big corporations and the very wealth begin to pay their fair share. I’m not an anti-corporation. I represent the state of Delaware. More corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other state in America combined. Combined. But guess what? But I’m a capitalist, man. Make all the money you want. Just begin to pay your fair share in taxes.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:13)', 'Speech': 'I remember the big fight I had not long ago, and the reason where I was able to cut the deficit already by 7 billion in the first year, and that was because we found out that we wanted to make sure that there were 50 corporations that made $40 billion in 2021, didn’t pay a penny in taxes. I did an awful thing. I convinced us all to raise it to 15%. Isn’t that awful? We paid for everything that we paid for and we’ve done so far and I still cut the deficit.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:49)', 'Speech': 'Look, a fair tax code is how we invest in things that make this country great in healthcare, education, defense, and so much more, research, development. Here’s the deal, the last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut, $2 trillion tax cut that benefits the very wealthy and the top 1%, the biggest corporations, and they exploded the federal deficit. Last administration added more to the national debt than any presidential term in American history. Debt. You turn on TV and you think he’s telling the truth. Debt.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:27)', 'Speech': 'Does anybody here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand. Well, I don’t think so either. I think if I don’t want to get in trouble with the press, but I bet they wouldn’t even raise their hands. Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax breaks? Because that’s what he wants to do. His tax cut’s about to expire and he wants to add another $2 trillion tax cut. Well, I’m going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, as I said, I ran for president and I promised nobody, nobody, as long as I’m president who earns less than $400,000, it’s a lot more than I ever made, will pay an additional penny in federal taxes. Nobody. Not a single cent. Nobody will pay a single penny more and they haven’t thus far.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:12)', 'Speech': 'Folks, it’s about fundamental fairness. Here’s another example. Folks, Obamacare became known as the Affordable Care Act, by the way, it’s still a very big deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:29)', 'Speech': 'Over 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition, but my predecessor and many Republicans want to take that away, [inaudible 00:09:40] they’re repealing the Affordable Care Act. I’m not going to let it happen. We stopped them literally 50 times, 50, five zero times in the last administration and we’re going to stop them again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:47)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we all miss someone who cast the deciding vote to pick the Affordable Care Act not long ago, my buddy John McCain passed away, my predecessor, that’s how he ended his career, voting no so they couldn’t cut him. John loved New Hampshire and he still drives my predecessor crazy, even though John’s long gone, but that’s John. My mother would say, “God love him.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:25)', 'Speech': 'Folks, we’re going to your delegation, I’m protecting and expanding the Affordable Care Act. A record-breaking 21 million Americans have signed up for healthcare under the ACA, including 65,000 folks right here in New Hampshire. I enacted tax credits that save, on average, $800 per person per year reducing health care premiums for million of working families under the Affordable Care Act. But those tax credits expire next year and I’m calling on Congress to make and expand the Affordable Care Act tax credits to make them permanent. Make them permanent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:04)', 'Speech': 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security Medicare back on the chopping block again. If anyone tries to cut Social Security Medicare or raise the retirement age again, I will stop them.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:19)', 'Speech': 'Working people built this country. They pay more into social security than the millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair. Folks, we have two ways to go in Social Security and Medicare. Republicans will cut Social Security and Medicare and give us more tax cuts for the wealthy. Even this morning, Donald Trump said, “Cut the Social Security and Medicare are on the table again.” When asked if he changed his position, he said, “There’s a lot you can do in terms of cutting. Tremendous amount of things you can cut.” You’re going to make me [inaudible 00:11:54]. “Tremendous amount of things you can do.” Not cut. He said, the bottom line is he’s still at it. I’m never going to allow that to happen. I won’t cut Social Security. I won’t cut Medicare.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:02)', 'Speech': 'Instead of ending Medicare and give tax breaks to the wealthy, I will protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share. In fact, my budget plan to preserve Medicare benefits in this Medicare trust fund because of Maggie’s leadership, because of it, I’m also cracking down on surprise medical bills. Here’s the deal, you go out there and you do your homework. You choose a hospital if you need the hospital based on what your insurance company will cover, and then when you get the bill, there’s a surprise charge because the hospital assigned an anesthesiologist or doctor that isn’t under your control in your insurance. That surprise bill can add up to thousands of dollars, thousands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:54)', 'Speech': 'Thanks to Maggie, we ended that surprise billing and we’re protecting one million million Americans every single month from those surprise bills. Folks, look, my budget also cracks down on what’s called facility fees for telemedicine. You get charged an extra fee if you’re in a rural area and you have a virtual visit where neither you nor the doctor is actually in the facility. That’s just another junk fee and it’s wrong. We got to end it. These surprise medical bills, junk fees add up to hundreds of dollars for ordinary families like the one I grew up in. And it makes a difference. Although it does generate $20 billion in profit. That’s what it does.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:40)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. Four years ago, this week before I came to office, our country was hit with the biggest, worst pandemic and economic crisis in the century. Remember the anxiety and the fear? Record job losses? Raging virus that would take more than one million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind, was estimated for every one who died, it left behind eight significant people; mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, an empty chair at the table.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:09)', 'Speech': 'The mental health crisis that resulted from the isolation and loneliness. A president, my predecessor, failed the most basic of any duty a president owes the American people; the duty to care. I believe that’s unforgivable. I came to office determined to uphold the duty to care and get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. And we have. Building the future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not just the top down. When the middle grows, the bottom has a chance, the poor have an opportunity, and the wealthy still do very well. They still do very well. Investing in all America and all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot. We leave nobody behind. Nobody. Our plan is working and America is coming back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:58)', 'Speech': 'Four years later, the pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer, turning a setback into a comeback. That’s the American story and I believe we’re moving into a future where healthcare is, of right now, a privilege in America. That’s why…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:16)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who we are, we’re the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Nothing, seriously. Not a joke. We’re the only country that’s ever come out of every crisis stronger than we went in, stronger than when we went in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:44)', 'Speech': 'And folks, I’ll give you one little example. I may not get it done, but if you give me a Congress, I will. No, I’m serious. You may not get it done, but here’s the deal. We have a thousand billionaires in America. That’s not a bad thing per se. You know what their average tax rate is? 8.2% taxes. Anybody want to trade their tax rate? No, I’m serious. If we just charge them, or had a tax code that was charging them 25%, not the highest rate, 25%. You know how much that would raise in the next 10 years? $400 billion. $40 billion a year. That’s what we could do, from cutting the deficit to providing for child care, providing healthcare to continue to provide our military with all they need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:58)', 'Speech': 'So folks, look, this is not beyond our capacity. We just have to listen. You’ve got to tell people what we want do and hope that they’ve figured out that what’s going on with the last guy will just repeat it, because if he gets elected, he’s publicly stated, he’ll try to repeal every single thing we’ve done so far. 15 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs. They go on and on. But people still need help. They still need help. Those folks sitting at the kitchen table, they still need some help on the day-to-day things and we’re going to work on those as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:15)', 'Speech': 'But anyway, I’ve taken too much of your time. You’re very gracious. Thank you all very much for being here. And as my mother would say, God bless you all. Thank you. And God protect our troops.'}]"

You’ve always had my back, and I’ve had yours, and you had people of this country and this city’s back. Housing is so much more than just a word. It’s about people’s lives. You can’t be here today because there are votes in Washington.

You’re doing a great job. And by the way… I won’t go into that, I guess. But look, folks, when I came to office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. Nevada was especially hard hit as tourism took a dive, a gigantic dive. Before I came to office, unemployment had reached 30% here, and we’re turning things around today because of the folks I just talked about. And Nevada has created 274,000 jobs, bringing back lost jobs of the pandemic and adding another 129,000 jobs. Things are on the move. Unemployment is down dramatically with more Nevadans working today than ever before in the history of Nevada. And thousands of cities across all of America are seeing this great comeback story. My American Rescue Plan, which I might add not a single solitary Republican voted for, provided 350 billion to state and local governments, including funds for every city, county, town, tribe in this state, and your state put that money to good use.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:03)', 'Speech': 'You put cops on the beat, teachers in the classroom, kept small businesses on their feet, and families in their homes.

My predecessor promised… Remember my predecessor kept talking about infrastructure weak for four years. Well, he didn’t build a thing. You all think I’m kidding. I’m not. I proposed and sign the most significant investment in our nation’s infrastructure and generations, and now we’re going to have an infrastructure decade. So far, 47,000 new projects modernize America’s, roads, bridges, ports, airports, public transit, and so much more is happening, creating jobs now, and jobs for the future as well. $3.4 billion in projects right here in Nevada, $3.4 billion.

By the end of this decade, every single part of the state will have high-speed, affordable internet, and we’re already saving 276,000 Nevada families as much as $75 a month on their internet bills.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:26)', 'Speech': 'And I know our friend Harry is looking down saying damn proud of… The airport in his name is getting an upgrade as well. I couldn’t do one without the other. He’s so proud of building America’s first high-speed rail line to take folks from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in two hours instead of four. That’s going to create 35,000, first major high speed rail line in America, 35,000 good paying jobs, take 3 million vehicles off the road, and reduce pollution significantly. It’s also taking the most significant…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:02)', 'Speech': 'By the way, it’s going to cut the time in half. Now, I don’t know why anybody want to get to LA in half the time, but I know why all won’t come here. All kidding aside, it really is incredible. It’s a gigantic project. And by the way, it’s encouraged California and central California to build a high-speed rail as well. The idea that we haven’t had one single high-speed rail built in America up to now is ridiculous. And so Chinese have a rail system that goes 130 miles an hour, 230 miles an hour I should say.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:41)', 'Speech': 'But look, we’re taking the most significant action to fight climate change ever. My policies have attracted $650 billion in private sector investments from companies that are moving clean energy factories and jobs back here in America where they belong. For example, in Reno, redwood materials is going to invest $3.5 billion, $3.5 billion, one of the country’s major electric vehicle battery cycling, manufacturing plants, creating thousands of jobs here, thousands of jobs. By the way, tomorrow in Arizona, we’ll be talking about America invented the semiconductor chip, the tiny chips the size of the tip of your little finger, which powers everything from automobiles, to smartphones, to weapon systems. We invented those chips, we made them better, and then we lost the market because a lot of the corporations said, “Let’s send the jobs overseas where they’re cheaper, and bring the product home, which is more expensive.” We don’t do that anymore. We make it here. We keep the jobs here. We sent products overseas.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:54)', 'Speech': 'The reason I mentioned we’ve been able to bring the chips manufacturing back home. We attracted $240 billion in private sector investments to build chip factories here in America. And by the way, they’re creating tens of thousands of good paying jobs both in construction and manufacturing, and the average salary in one of those, they call them FABS, or factories, is $100,000 a year and you don’t need a college degree to get that job. Across the country, folks have filed a record number of new business applications since I took office, the fastest growth of Latino-owned businesses in more than a decade, more black small businesses starting at the highest rate in 30 years. In Nevada, since I came to office, we’ve seen 195,000 small business applications, and every one of those applications is an act of hope. It’s critical because small businesses… And the reason I keep talking about small businesses, small businesses make up half the GDP, half the economy of America. Half of all the economy of America generated by small businesses.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:55)', 'Speech': 'But here’s the deal, as more folks move to Nevada for good-paying jobs, we need housing that’s affordable. In the depth of the pandemic, the American Rescue plan delivered funds to keep 8 million families in their homes nationwide by preventing foreclosures and evictions. Here in Nevada, you use those funds to keep 50,000 people’s rent to be able to be paid. Hundreds of first-time home buyers be able to make a down payment. You invest in more in building and renovating affordable homes than almost any other part of the country, any state in the country. For example, here in Clark County, nearly 1,000 brand-new affordable units for seniors are under construction today as a result, 8,000 homes total for families, seniors, and veterans. And across the country, more people own homes now than before the pandemic. We’re seeing fewer foreclosures than any time in decades, but we have a lot more to do. For too many people, the dream of having a good home and still feels out of reach. I get it.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:02)', 'Speech': 'Look, here’s my plan. But everybody thinks because I was president, I was probably born wealthy and come from a significant background economically. Well, I had the dubious distinction being listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. I got a phone call. My wife was campaigning… I was campaigning up in New Hampshire back when that statistic came out in the nineties, and she called. I used to call because the kids were little when I was away, and say, “How’s everything going?” I got this, “Fine.” You know you’re in trouble when your wife or husband says, “Fine.” I said, “What’s the matter?” She said… Only elected official’s husband or wife understand this. She said, “Did you read today’s paper?” I said, “They don’t have today’s paper, Wilmington paper Delaware where I’m with Leahy up in Vermont. And she said, “Well, let me read it. Top of the full headline, Biden, poorest man in Congress. Is that true?” I don’t know how the hell it was true, but it turned out it was true. But here’s the deal. My new budget works to lower housing costs for owners and renters alike today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:18)', 'Speech': 'I was raised in a… When Scranton, where I was born, and in my early years were raised, when Scranton went dead in terms of the economy, we moved down to a little place called Claymont Delaware where my dad had started off as a kid. And we couldn’t afford anything. We lived in a duplex called Brookview Apartments, which became public housing years later. And my dad kept trying to figure out how we get the down payment to get the first home. Well, we rented and we saved, he saved, and we were able to buy a three-bedroom home and a new development because these areas, they were building 40, 50 homes at a shot. We had four kids and three bedrooms and a grandpa living with us. And we weren’t poor, but we never had anything at the end of the month.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:11)', 'Speech': 'And so what my dad used to always say was that the way you build equity in your home is the way you build wealth. So when you build enough equity in your home, then you have enough money to borrow to get something new and move and so on. And that’s how everybody makes it. Everybody in middle class makes it there, usually through equity in their home. Well, look, it works. What we’ve been doing works to increase housing supply and keep costs down in the future. First, for homeowners, inflation keeps coming down and it’s predicted to do that. Mortgage rates are going to come down as well, but I’m not going to wait. I’m not going to wait.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:49)', 'Speech': 'I want to provide an annual tax credit will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space if they come from middle-class background, they come from a family that has well under $200,000 or less. We’re also making more affordable to refinance your home by eliminating title insurance fees on federally funded backed mortgages. That’s going to save folks as much as a $1,500. The federal government can afford to do that. In addition, last week, the National Association of Realtors agreed for the first time that Americans can negotiate lower commissions when they buy or sell their home'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:41)', 'Speech': 'On a typical home purchase, that loan could save folks an average of $10,000 on a sale or purchase. I’m calling on realtors to follow through on lowering their commissions to protect home buyers. And folks, we’re also working and the legacy of discrimination on the base of home valuations. It’s exacerbated. As you know, it’s exacerbated racial wealth gap and held back black and brown families, and it’s simply wrong. If you build a… If the developer came along and built 20 homes on one side of a highway and 20 homes on the other, and the one side had people of black and brown backgrounds and the same exact home was built in the white neighborhood, guess what? The day you won that home, that black home was worth 20% less than the white home, or the Hispanic home was worth 20% less. It’s wrong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:32)', 'Speech': 'Second, my plan goes to work so we can bring rents down. My administration’s cracking down on big corporations who break antitrust laws by price fixing to keep the rents up. That’s how they work it out. Landlords should be competing to give folks the best deal, not conspiring to charge them more. You’re also going after what I call unfair rental and junk fees, like the ones you charge when you move into an apartment, one of those surprise convenience fees that aren’t convenient at all. You can add up to hundreds of dollars. And some of you have been stuck with that. Folks are tired of being played for suckers and I’m tired of letting them be played for suckers. We’re also expanding rental assistance to over 100,000 more low-income families. Since I took office, the biggest increase in 20 years. And my new plan would help hundreds of thousands more, including foster kids, as we mentioned earlier, aging out of foster care, so they have to move out living on their own for the first time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:42)', 'Speech': 'It’s also going to help thousands of veterans afford the rent because no one should be homeless in America, especially someone who served this country. Folks, we know affordable housing has been a challenge for a long time. To solve it long-term, we have to increase supply. Because when supply down, demand is up, costs rise. The bottom line to lower housing costs for good is to build, build, build. And that’s why to help your congressional delegation. I’ve cut red tape so more builders can get federal financing for the new project, a record 1.7 million new housing units are under construction nationwide right now because of it. In fact, today, my administration reported that single-family housing starts are the highest level they’ve been to nearly two years, and my new plan would create 2 million affordable homes, including tens of thousands right here in Nevada.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:49)', 'Speech': 'And we’re doing this through what they call the neighborhood home tax credit to build or renovate affordable housing, and we do it by expanding the bipartisan low income. It’s called the low income… Sorry, with all these titles, but that’s what these bills are, a low income housing tax credit to build affordable rental units, which supported by lenders, builders, families, and housing advocates alike. Look, my plan will also establish an innovative program to help communities build and renovate housing or convert housing from empty office spaces into housing, empty hotels into housing. My plan would provide $8 billion to fight homelessness and move people into homes and off the street. I’ll say it again,'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:37)', 'Speech': 'The United States, no one should have to live in the street. No one. Folks altogether experts are calling these measures, quote, “The most consequential housing plan in more than 50 years.” But let me be clear, it’s not only my plan. It is fully paid for. And while I’m paying for it, we’re also reducing the federal debt at the same time. I know the Republicans talk about big tax and Democrats. Give me a break. Come on. I’ve already cut the federal deficit by $1 trillion since I took office. The last guy increased the deficit by a larger margin than any president in American history in the four years he was president, I signed the bipartisan budget deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade. For example, because of the law, I signed finally, big pharma, the pharmaceutical companies, and we finally beat them, giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prescription drug prices they pay for seniors like they do with the Veterans Administration. The VA says, “I need this for veterans, but I’m not going to pay you more than this for this amount of money.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:44)', 'Speech': 'Well, it doesn’t just save seniors money. It’s already saving taxpayers money. The one thing we’ve been able to do is, when I did that one thing and making sure that you’re going to be able to have insulin for 35 bucks instead of 400 bucks a month, well, guess what? That cut the deficit by $160 billion, $160 billion. And there’s a reason for it. Not only saves seniors a lot of money… And when I first wrote it, it included everybody. The Republicans knocked out everybody and left the seniors in. They couldn’t lose that one. But here’s the deal, $160 billion over the next decade, because big pharma doesn’t have to pay out the $400 a month. They’re paying out $35 a month too big pharma. My plan would double the number of drugs able to be negotiated to save another 200 billion a year.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:37)', 'Speech': 'This bill has already been passed. Here’s the deal, folks. Right now, we cut the deficit even more by making the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share, but here’s the deal. If you’re going to deal with Medicare and you want to make sure you’re going to be able to save money, well, guess what? Many of you know seniors who have cancer drugs, it costs up to $35,000, $15,000 a year, 12, 15,000 bucks with all their other costs. Well, guess what? Already passed the law beginning in 2024, January 2025, no matter what the total cost of prescription drug costs for a senior are, they will not have to pay more than $2,000, period. 2,000.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:25)', 'Speech': 'It’s going to save another 200,000. Anyway, I get really… If we drove out to the airport and put you on Air Force One, you said you had a prescription needed filled and it was an American company that made it, I’d say, “Okay, let’s fly to Toronto, or to Berlin, or to London, or to Rome, or any major city in America, I’ll get you that same prescription filled in those cities for 40 to 60% less it’ll cost you at a pharmacy year.” It’s wrong. But look, I’m a capitalist. If you want to make a billion bucks, great. Just begin to pay your fair share of taxes'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:14)', 'Speech': 'In 2020, 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies made 40 billion in profits. They paid zero in federal taxes. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15%, but that’s still too little to have to pay in federal. Wouldn’t you all trade that? You have to pay 15% instead of what you’re paying now. But look, it’s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21%, so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. Before the whole thing with COVID, there were 750 billionaires with a B in America. Today, there are a thousand. You know what they pay in average, the average tax for billionaires in America, 8.2% federal tax. Anybody want to trade them with the billionaire tax? I’d take 8.2%. It’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than the teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse, anybody busting the net.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:25)', 'Speech': 'That’s why I’m proposing. If I’m re-elected, we’re going to get it done, a minimum tax of 25% for billionaires. That’s not even the highest tax rate, just 25%. You know how much that would raise over 10 years? 500 billion in 10 years, 500 billion if they just started to pay that. Imagine what we could do. We could cut the federal deficit even more. We can invest in things that make America great again, child care, a whole range of things we could do. And we’d all be better, affordable child, home care, housing, all of which help families grow our economy. And by the way, every one of these things I propose, I asked the Treasury department to do a study for me because I’m a pro-union guy and I’ve been the most pro-union president of American history, and here’s the deal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:11)', 'Speech': 'And people say, “Well, that costs a lot of money.” It saves money. The study they’ve done points out that union labor and contracts raise everybody’s income, everybody’s income, and they have the best in the world. Besides, like I said, when I got all, when I got that $350 billion invested for computer chips, I was in… It was a Samsung in South Korea, convinced them to come here. I said, “Why would you come here?” He said, “You have the workers in the world, and my safest investment is in America.” Folks, there’s so much we could do, but my predecessor has a totally different view when it comes to fair taxes. He said, and he said this to his friends in Mar-a-Lago, quote, it’s on the record, “I know plenty of you.” This is his quote. “You’re rich as hell, and we’re going to give you tax cuts.” That’s what he says out loud.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:09)', 'Speech': 'When the president enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the very wealthy and biggest corporations, he exploded the federal deficit, as I said. He added more to the national debt than any president has in one term in all of American history, and he wants to do it again. He’s committed to another $2 trillion tax cap for the wealthy and biggest corporations. He also proposed cutting funds for affordable housing, not building them, cutting the funds for them. Folks at home, does anybody really think anybody really think the tax code is fair? I don’t know. You don’t really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax code, do you? Well, they’re doing pretty well. I sure in hell don’t. Look, I’m going to keep fighting like the devil to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share to make the tax system fairer.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:00)', 'Speech': 'And under my plan, to make sure I wasn’t able to be at the other end of his demagoguery, I made a commitment when I got elected, and I’ve kept it, no one earning less than $400,000 a year, which is a lot of money where I come from, will pay an additional penny in federal tax, not one single penny, not one penny, but everybody else is going to start paying their fair share. Let me close with this. As I travel the country, folks often tell me how back in 2020, they were down. They lost their business, they lost faith in the system. But then those laws we passed, the work we’ve done together, got them back on their feet, we created 15 million new jobs in three years, more than any administration has in history. We’re keeping millions of people in their homes. We’re creating a new cycle of hope and pride.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:52)', 'Speech': 'Pride in your hometown is making a comeback, pride in America, pride in knowing you can get big things done if we work together. I’ve never been more… We have a lot more to do, a lot more to do. Reason this election is so important is not about me. It’s about the future. It’s about the future. He wants to undo every single thing we’ve done if he gets elected. He stated it straight up. But there’s so much more to keep and to do. I’m never more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who in hell we are. We’re the United States of America. There is nothing, think about, nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in every time when we work together. And with your help, we’re going to get people working together in a way they haven’t for decades. So ladies and gentlemen, God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Let’s get this done.'}]"

The next great chapter of science and manufacturing technology, and the timing couldn’t be more critical. We all remember that Covid provided us an incredible wake-up call. A wake-up call that shocked and disrupted our global supply chains, that choked our manufacturing lines. It kept essential products away from people when they needed them most, and all because one and $2 semiconductor chips weren’t available. Manufacturing lines stopped. Make no mistake, fragile global supply chains are a threat not just to our economic, but also to our national security as well. By coming together today, we are declaring that America will not surrender leadership to our competitors. We are choosing innovation over inaction. We are building a future with geographically balanced and resilient supply chains right here in America, right here in Arizona.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:29)', 'Speech': 'Historians will look back on this period as a once-in-a-generation defining moment. A moment to challenge our old assumptions and to drive fundamental structural changes for the future. America must lead the way into this new era by regaining our leadership, especially with the turbocharged acceleration that AI is providing to our world and its incredibly promising potential, and we will be to meet this next surge of semiconductor demand. All of us at Intel believe that restoring our nation’s leadership and semiconductors is more than just an opportunity, more than just the responsibility, it’s our calling. This is what we were built for as a company. This is what we do. And we have already announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the US over a five-year period.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:33)', 'Speech': 'I first walked through the doors of this iconic company as an eighteen-year-old kid with an associate’s degree, starting as a technician. I took the job as Intel CEO to honor the Intel Trinity. The trio that puts silicon into Silicon Valley. Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove. And through the years, I’ve had the honor of witnessing firsthand of learning at their feet that this American excellence, this power of technology innovation, but the power and the role of American manufacturing, and our facilities have grown. We have the extraordinary Oregon, the Silicon Forest. We have the extraordinary Arizona, the Silicon Desert. And the extraordinary New Mexico, the Silicon Mesa.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:42)', 'Speech': 'And one of my proudest moments was standing beside President Biden in Ohio and beginning of a new chapter of American innovation at Intel. I can say that Field of Dreams is now an extraordinary construction site that’s coming to life before your very eyes. We are so proud that President Biden and Secretary Raimondo believe in this vision of expanding U.S. chip-making capacity and capabilities. And we are, I am grateful for this funding and the confidence and commitment that you’re placing in us. Mr. President and Madam secretary, we will not let you down.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:28)', 'Speech': 'We’re going to put every one of these taxpayer dollars to work and we are committed to delivering the silicon that powers our world while driving to the lowest possible environmental footprint, and rebuilding resilience into our operations and value chain and supply chain, all while leading innovation for the world. It’s fitting that we are standing here on an Intel construction site because these investments, these extraordinary commitments are going to build right here in America, right here in Arizona. We’re going to keep building and innovating new chips that power the future and help humanity to be a better place for our children and grandchildren. We’re going to build stronger communities and local economies from Arizona to Ohio by creating nearly 80,000 jobs at Intel in our construction sites with suppliers and more. That’s a lot of jobs. You should applaud that. Yeah.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:35)', 'Speech': 'And we’re going to continue to support our employees like Tilden Dixon, a Native American, a member of the Sheet Metals Union, Local 359, and responsible for metal sheet detailing right here at Intel.

The Chips Act is just the kind of bold action that will get us there. And for all of these reasons and more, we applaud President Biden, his administration, Secretary of Commerce Raimondo, the bipartisan group of policy makers that came together to make the Chips Act a reality. And now thank you, and Tilden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:25)', 'Speech': 'I chose to follow his footsteps and join the Local 359 in 2012. I served my apprenticeship and then secured a job at the Intel construction site where I’ve been for the last past six years. It was a commitment to go to class and work a full-time job for many of years, but I’ve learned a lot and now I am a BIM coordinator at the construction site where I design 3D modeled routes that are used to construct Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing fab tools. I love my job. I’m currently saving so that one day very soon I can buy a house.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:20)', 'Speech': 'But I’m not the only one whose lives have been transformed for the better. Thank you to President Biden’s historic investments, there are now hundreds of jobs, hundreds of new jobs for the people of Arizona who are building Intel’s new cutting edge chip factories and building the future of America. I am so grateful and proud we have a president who has the understanding of importance, giving the opportunity like this to communities like ours and to millions of Americans like me.

And thank you representative Stanton for your dedication to the people of the fourth district and for the passport anyway getting in. While he couldn’t be here today because the votes in Washington, I want to thank Senator Mark Kelly, who’s doing an incredible job and the real champion from the announcement that we make here today. And Mayor Kate, where’s Kate? Thank you Kate. You’re an incredible, mayor, you’re doing a great job. And Mayor of Chandler, Hartke. I guess I’m technically in your city, right?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:24)', 'Speech': 'I’ve asked Pat and many other business leaders this question and I mean it sincerely, I met with the Business Roundtable… Please have a seat by the way, you’re all standing. I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you’re still standing. I apologize.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:37)', 'Speech': 'I asked the question of the Business Roundtable, the biggest leaders of business in the world and the United States particularly. I asked them, “When the United States decides to invest considerable resources in the new industry that we need to build, does that encourage business or does it discourage it?” And the answer was overwhelming, “Encourage it.” Overwhelmingly. Folks, during the pandemic, we had to learn about supply chains and the shortage of semiconductors. Those tiny computer chips you all out here know very well, smaller than a tip of your finger that power everything from the likes of your cell phones, cars, dishwashers, satellites, weapon systems. American invented these chips. Don’t forget that we invented these chips. And over time some thought it was cheaper to send the manufacturing overseas because labor was cheaper. As a result, when the pandemic shut down chips factories overseas, prices of everything went up. First time Americans began to realize just how important they were. Unlike my predecessor, I was determined to turn things around to invest in American, all American, all Americans, and that’s what we’ve been doing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:49)', 'Speech': 'In January of 2022, Pat came to the White House where we announced the historic investment to build a state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in Ohio. Factories in Ohio. We were joined then by Sherrod Brown, the Ohio senator, who talked about why it’s time to bury the phrase Rust belt. And Pat said at the time, we should start calling the Silicon Heartland and it is becoming that. By March of this year, Pat was my guest of the State of the Union where we talked about a hundred thousand acres outside of Columbus where semiconductor manufacturing facility and fabs were being built, which I referred to at the time as a Field of Dreams, and boy it’s turning out to meet people’s dreams out there.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:30)', 'Speech': 'In August, Senator Kelly and Sherrod Brown got the Chips and Science Act to my desk. It was one of the most significant science and technology investments in our history. By September, I joined Pat in Ohio and to break ground for the new factory. Within nine months we’re just getting started. Since my Chips and Science Act was led to the partnership with companies investing billions and billions of dollars across the country, bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to America, jobs of the future back to America, including here in Arizona with a significant help of Mark Kelly. I tell you what, I’m so glad this is happening. Those phone calls every 20 minutes were getting old. I tell you, he is committed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:21)', 'Speech': 'In December of 2022, I came to Phoenix where I joined so many of you as well as CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, to talk about the historic investments that the Chips and Science Act was delivering to make chips here in Phoenix. Today, Pat is building here on another field of dreams. I’m thrilled to announce the latest public-private partnership and one of the largest investments of semiconductors in the United States ever. The landmark, a new landmark agreement under the Chips and Science Act between my administration and Intel, for up to $8.5 billion. That’s a smart investment. And that’s being paired with over a hundred billion from Intel, including 30 billion in Arizona and 30 billion in Ohio. It’s among the largest private-sector investments ever in the history of Ohio and in Arizona. And this historic funding will use to build new semiconductor fab facilities and modernize. Modernize and expand existing ones in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon. Combined, it will create nearly 20,000 construction jobs, many of which will be union jobs. And I’ve made it real clear. Everybody has a right to organize, man, to have their labor rights protected.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:45)', 'Speech': 'But look, this announcement will also support 10,000 manufacturing jobs. 3,000 right here in Phoenix with salaries averaging over $100,000 dollars a year and don’t all require college degrees. That’s a change. For the first time in a long time, many of these facilities won’t just manufacture regular semiconductors. They’re going to once again begin to make the most sophisticated, advanced and powerful leading-edge chips. Each chip has… This is something that blows my mind. Has trillions and trillions of tiny features. The width of a strand of human DNA. 40,000 times thinner than a single human hair, that require manufacturing precision down to the size of a single atom. The process is enormous, requires enormous amounts of information and with lightning speed they’ll produce. And they’re critical to emerging technologies. They’re going to power the future economy like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 6G communications, and make everything faster, lighter, smaller, and more reliable.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:58)', 'Speech': 'Folks, it’s about time. Even though we invented the most advanced chips, we make 0% of them today. 0% of the most advanced chips today. Nearly all manufacturing of leading-edge chips across the entire industry moved overseas to Asia years ago. That’s why today’s investment is such a big deal. We will enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America after 40 years. It’s going to transform the semiconductor industry and create entirely new ecosystems, entirely new research and design, and manufacturing in advanced chips in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:38)', 'Speech': 'By the way, parenthetically, I say we’re going to become the manufacturing capital world again. People looked at me like I was nuts. Where the hell’s the written saying, we’re not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world again? We’ve already created 825,000 new manufacturing jobs and you’re just getting us started. There’s not a damn thing America can’t do if we set our mind to it. It’s going to put us on track to manufacture 20% of the world’s leading-edge chips by the end of the decade. And right here in the United States. Intel is committed to net-zero greenhouse gases, gas emissions by 2040 and using 100% renewable electricity to power these fabs. And there’s more, because this isn’t just about investing in America, it’s about investing in the American people as well. That’s why we’re dedicating $50 million of chips funding to partner with Intel and community stakeholders like community colleges, state and local governments, labor unions and universities, to train a new generation of workers for the semiconductor industry. That way people don’t have to leave their hometowns to get good-paying jobs and support their families.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:46)', 'Speech': 'And here in Arizona, Arizona State University is expanding its engineering program. Catch this, you guys know this, every time I say it and I talk about, it’s just astounding to me. It’s going to expand their engineering to over 10,000 additional students. 10,000 additional engineering students. Community colleges are training new technicians and launching free semiconductor technician programs led by Intel employees. Local unions are building training centers for apprenticeships and Intel is investing in semiconductor education starting as early as high school. So students get hands-on experience in a path to good-paying jobs, whether or not they get to go to college. The same thing is happening in other states as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:35)', 'Speech': 'It’s all part of my Investing in America agenda, which has attracted $675 billion. $675 billion in private sector investments and ignited a manufacturing boom in America. A clean energy boom. A jobs boom. All here in America, finally. Since I took office, America’s had the strongest growth of any major economy in the world. Nearly 15 million new jobs along a stretch of unemployment under 4% in 50 years. Four, 50. Growth is strong. Wages are up more than prices, inflation is down dramatically. I get it, we have more to do, but no question, our plan of delivering for the American people is working now. And since I came to office here in Arizona, because of your investment in American agenda, we’ve deployed and developed nearly $8 billion in federal funds to upgrade infrastructure and clean energy. Right here in Arizona, we’ve created 300,000 new jobs. Let me say that again. In Arizona, 300,000 new jobs.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:44)', 'Speech': 'I was finally able to beat big pharmaceutical companies because Medicare had been trying for years. But Medicare now is the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs for seniors, including 1.4 million seniors right here in Arizona. And to put this in perspective, whatever prescription you have made by any American drug manufacturer, jump on Air Force One where they’ll fly to any major city in the world, from Toronto to Berlin to Baghdad, anywhere around the world. It’ll get off the plane, you bring that prescription into that country, you’ll be able to buy it for 40 to 60% less. It’s wrong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:25)', 'Speech': 'So guess what? When we began to manufacture and negotiate, when I said, look, Medicare buys all these drugs, billions of dollars worth to take care of Medicare and Medicaid, well guess what? You know how much it costs to make insulin. Anybody know anybody who needs insulin? Raise their hand. You’re darn right. Well, guess what? It’s now 35 bucks a month. It was 400 bucks a month. Know how much it costs to make it? $10. $10. And they will cap a total out of pocket expense for prescription drugs, all the drugs a senior has to take, all of them, at $2,000, including expensive cancer drugs that cost 10, 12, $15,000 a year. They never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all the drugs they need.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:20)', 'Speech': 'But folks, by the way, not only save seniors money, it saves taxpayers significant amount of money. We reduced the consequence of the law, I wrote and got passed. Reduced the federal deficit by $160 billion. Hear me? $160 billion. You know why? Medicare doesn’t have to pay $400, they have to pay $35 for that prescription and much more. Exorbitant prices. And it’s all part of my economic vision for this country. I determined that I was going to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down because when you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. Let’s be clear. Let’s be clear. It’s a fundamental break from the trickle-down economics, supercharged by my predecessor. On his watch, companies send American jobs overseas for cheaper labor and imported products. We’re creating jobs in America and exporting American products.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:23)', 'Speech': 'Well, my predecessor and his allies in Congress want to go back. In fact, the vast majority of the team on the other side, my Republican friends, didn’t vote for the Chips and Science Act. The majority of them didn’t. And now they’re trying to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant action ever on climate that’s going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, many of them in their own states, in your district, particularly in states like Arizona. That’s when my predecessor was in office. He enacted instead a $2 trillion tax cut for the overwhelmingly benefit the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. By the way, I’m not anti-Corporation. I come from the corporate state of America. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. And I represented them for 36 years. But they can’t get greedy. And here’s what he wants to do this again.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:13)', 'Speech': 'The bottom line. I want to build a future in America. My predecessor is going to let the future be built in China and other countries, not America, because it may be cheaper for those investing. Folks, I promise to be the President for all Americans. Whether you voted for me or didn’t vote for me. Today’s investment helps all Americans in red states and blue states. All across America. Urban, rural, suburban, and tribal communities. But we’re not leaving anyone behind. If we invent it in America, it should be made in America. And include all of America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:53)', 'Speech': 'Folks, let me close with this. I’ve been determined to make things in this country again, to build manufacturing capacity. As I said, we’ve created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs and we’re still counting. To make sure we never again are in a position where during a pandemic we’re relying on other countries to make things that we badly need here at home to be able to go forward. Folks, some folks didn’t believe we could do this, but I’ve made no bones about it. I’ve said for a long time, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, if we invest in America, we can change the country’s future and lead the world again. We are leading the world again. We’re proving it’s never been a good bet to bet against America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:34)', 'Speech': 'I’ve spent more time with Xi Jinping, the leader of China than any other world leader has. And I was with him, traveled 17,000 miles when he was vice president and I was vice president, before he became the leader. And we’re in a Tibetan plateau. And he asked me, he said, “Can you define America for me?” I said, “I sure can, in one word.” And he looked at me, I said, “Possibilities. Possibilities.” We have come out of every crisis we’ve ever been in stronger than we went into that crisis. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. So God bless you all and may God protect our troops. You’re the best. You’re the best. This is going to transform the country in a way you don’t even understand yet. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

Not still. Were unaccounted for. That number might change. Two have been rescued, one without injury, one in critical condition. And the search and rescue operation is continuing for all those remaining as we speak. I spoke with Governor Moore this morning as well as the mayor of Baltimore, the county executive, to both the United States senators and the congressmen, and my secretary of transportation is on the scene. I told them we’re going to send all the federal resources they need as we respond to this emergency. And I mean all the federal resources. And we’re going to rebuild that port together.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:42)', 'Speech': 'Everything so far indicates that this was a terrible accident. At this time we have no other indication, no other reason to believe there’s any intentional act here. Personnel on board the ship were able to alert the Maryland Department of Transportation that they had lost control of their vessel, as you all know and reported. As a result, local authorities were able to close the bridge to traffic before the bridge was struck, which undoubtedly saved lives. And our prayers are with everyone involved in this terrible accident, and all the families, especially those waiting for the news of their loved one right now.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:15)', 'Speech': 'I know every minute in that circumstance feels like a lifetime. You just don’t know. It’s just terrible. We’re incredibly grateful for the brave rescuers who immediately rushed to the scene, and to the people of Baltimore who, we want to say we’re with you. We’re going to stay with you as long as it takes. And like governor said, you’re Maryland tough, you’re Baltimore strong, and we’re going to get through this together. And I promise we’re not leaving. Here’s what’s happening now: the search and rescue operation is our top priority. Ship traffic in the Port of Baltimore has been suspended until further notice, and we’ll need to clear that channel before the ship traffic can resume.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:55)', 'Speech': 'The Army Corps of Engineers is on the spot and is going to help lead this effort to clear the channel. The Port of Baltimore is one of the nation’s largest shipping hubs and I’ve been there a number of times as a senator and as a vice president. It handled a record amount of cargo last year. It’s also the top port in America for both imports and exports of automobiles and light trucks. Around 850,000 vehicles go through that port every single year, and we’re going to get it up and running again as soon as possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:25)', 'Speech': '15,000 jobs depend on that port, and we’re going to do everything we can to protect those jobs and help those workers. The bridge is also critical for travel, not just for Baltimore but for the northeast corridor. Over 30,000 vehicles across the Francis Scott Key Bridge on a daily basis. It’s virtually… well, it’s one of the most important elements for the economy in the northeast and the quality of life.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:52)', 'Speech': 'My transportation secretary is there now. As I told Governor Moore, I’ve directed my team move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible. And we’re going to work hand in hand with the support of Maryland to support Maryland in whatever they ask for. We’re going to work with our partners in Congress to make sure the state gets the support it needs. It’s my intention that the federal government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing that bridge, and I expect the Congress to support my effort.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:22)', 'Speech': 'This is going to take some time and the people of Baltimore can count on us, though, to stick with them at every step of the way until the port is reopened and the bridge is rebuilt. We’re not leaving until this job gets done. Not leaving until then. So I just want to say God bless everybody, everyone harmed this morning and their families. And may God bless the first responders, many of whom are risking their lives.

He signed the American Rescue Plan, saving the pensions of more than 1,000,000 workers and retirees. His investing in America Agenda created 15,000,000 jobs so far. His commitment to Build America, Buy America unleashed demand for union-made steel, aluminum, glass, and many other products. His enforcement of trade rules ensures that American workers compete on a level playing field with their counterparts around the globe. President Biden made history last year when he walked the picket line with striking auto workers, ensuring that they got a fair contract. And now he’s standing in solidarity with us as we fight to keep US Steel from selling out our livelihoods and our communities. He has our backs, just like we knew he would.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:27)', 'Speech': 'President Biden likes to say that the middle class built America and unions built the middle class. He’s right, but the fight continues and his support, his leadership, his vision help us to grow stronger every day. As a Marine Corps veteran and on behalf of United Steelworkers, I’m honored to introduce Joe Biden, the President of the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:50)', 'Speech': 'There’s an expression that comes to mind. “You go home with them that brung you to the dance,” and you brought me to the dance. No joke. The Mayor and I are buddies. I told the Mayor, and I mean it sincerely, the first outfit ever to endorse me as a 29-year-old kid running in a tough year for United States Senate, make me the second-youngest man ever elected to the Senate was a guy named Huey Carcella, and back in those days, we had a big Steel Workers. We had a lot of steel workers in Claymont, Delaware where I was from because they worked in worst steel company. And I’ll never forget coming to me and saying, “We’re going to get your help.” I came out to Pittsburgh and steel workers endorsed me. It changed everything.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:42)', 'Speech': 'Nixon won my state. Nixon won my State of Delaware with 60% of the vote, and I won with an astounding 3,100 majority, and it’s thanks to you. I really mean it. I’m Pittsburgh and I really mean it. My love for Pittsburgh goes back to my Scranton days. My grandfather, Finnegan, always talked about Pittsburgh. Any rate, make a long story short. The bottom line for all kidding aside, is I’m president because of you guys. I really am. And I’m proud, as I mentioned earlier, I’m proud to be the most pro-union president in American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:20)', 'Speech': 'Where I was raised, it isn’t labor, it’s unions. Unions. I not going to say, Joey, you are union from belt, buckle to shoe sole. Well, I want to thank some folks who had my back and had to stay back in Washington, couldn’t be here today. Representative Summer Lee, and by the way, there are votes going on, and Chris Deluzio, and Senator Bobby Casey is one of my closest friends as his dad was, and John Fetterman who I want to stay on his side no matter what. And thank you to all the state and local leaders here, including the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Ed Gainey. Ed, you’re the best buddy. You’ve really stepped up. And a great leader, Joe. Joe Burris, an army veteran from a steelworking family. He was my guest at the State of the Union just a couple of years ago. He came back home to Washington, Pennsylvania, decided to run for Mayor, and he won. And he’s still working as a steelworker, but that’s America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:31)', 'Speech': 'Look, folks, I was almost exactly five years ago that I began my campaign for president right here in Pittsburgh where I announced. I said one of the reasons I was running was to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class, and it was already mentioned, it’s been mentioned a thousand times, thankfully since then that the backbone of America has a steel spine. It really does have a steel spine. You heard me say it before. Wall Street didn’t build America, middle class didn’t build America, and you guys built the middle class, unions built it, and that’s why I’m here today to announce a series of actions that I stand by you, the American steelworker.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:09)', 'Speech': 'Look, first, US Steel has been an iconic American company for more than a century, and it should remain a totally American company. American owned, American-operated by American Union steelworkers, the best in the world, and that’s going to happen, I promise you. Second, America’s still working out, work out, compete as long as they have fair competition. But for too long, the Chinese government has poured state money into Chinese steel companies, pushing them to make so much steel as much as possible, subsidized by the Chinese government. Because Chinese steel companies produce a lot more steel than China needs, it ends up dumping extra steel into the global markets at unfairly low prices, and the prices are unfairly low because China steel companies don’t need to worry about making a profit because the Chinese governor subsidized them so heavily. They’re not competing. They’re cheating. They’re cheating. And we’ve seen the damage here in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:10)', 'Speech': 'Back in the early 2000s, the Chinese steel began flooding the market in steel towns all across Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit very hard. Between those years, 2000 and 2010, more than 14,000 steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Ohio lost their jobs, 14,000. Let me ask you, we’re going to let that happen again? I promise you, and I’m not going to let that happen again. Look, right now, my US trade representative is investigating trade practices by the Chinese government regarding steel and aluminum. If that investor confirms these anti-competitive trade practices, then I’m calling on her to consider tripling the tariff rates for both steel and aluminum imports from China. We know that Chinese steel and aluminum are being imported in America through Mexico that avoids the tariff, and just yesterday I had a delegation down in Mexico, meeting with AMLO, the Mexican president to address this issue. Mexico and the United States are going to work together to solve it, I promise you, I promise you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:12)', 'Speech': 'My administration is also taking a real hard look at the Chinese government’s industrial practices when it comes to global shipbuilding, which is critical to our economy. We depend on a fleet of commercial shipping vessels that carry American products around the world. Shipbuilding is critical to our national security, including the strength of the United States Navy. That’s why my administration takes it very seriously that US steelworkers, along with four other unions, have asked us to investigate whether the Chinese government is using anti-competitive practice to artificially lower prices in the shipbuilding industry. We’ve heard you. If the Chinese government is doing that and they want to undermine free and fair trade competition in the shipping industry, I will take action. That investigation is going on.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:57)', 'Speech': 'Taken together, these are strategic and targeted actions that are going to protect American workers and ensure fair competition. Meanwhile, my predecessor and the MAGA Republicans want to cross the board tariffs on all imports from all countries that could badly hurt American consumers. It’s estimated it would cost the average American family an average of $1,500 a year if they succeeded in doing that. Trump simply doesn’t get it. For years, I’ve heard many of my Republicans, even Democratic friends say that China’s on the rise and America has been falling behind. You may have noticed the last two years I’ve been the only one disagreeing with that. I’ve always believed we’ve got it all wrong. America’s rising. We have the best economy in the world, which we do. Since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down in the lowest level in over a decade, and we’re standing up against Chinese government for economic practice and industrial overcapacity, and we are the strongest economy in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:58)', 'Speech': 'In addition, and by the way, I always say to my colleagues when I meet other world leaders, I say, “Would you trade places with China? Would you trade places with their problems?” They’ve got a population that is more people in retirement than working. They’re not importing any… They’re not bringing… They’re xenophobic. Nobody else coming in. They’ve got real problems. I’m not looking for a fight with China. I’m looking for competition, but fair competition.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:27)', 'Speech': 'And issue we’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. I’ve revitalized our partnerships and our alliances in the Pacific with India, Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and other Pacific Island nations. I made sure that we have the most advanced technologies that we’ve developed and invented, and they can’t be sent to China or undermined because they’ll undermine our national security. When I spoke with Xi Jinping, he said, “Why?” I said, “Because you use them for all the wrong reasons, so you’re not going to get those advanced computer chips.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:58)', 'Speech': 'Finally, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that. The bottom line is I want fair competition with China, not conflict, and we’re in a stronger position to win the economic competition of the 21st century against China or anyone else because we’re investing in America and American workers again, finally. You know There’s a law back in the 30s that passed, whether unions could exist? There’s a provision that very few presidents ever paid attention to. If a president has sent money from the Congress to do something for the public, he must use American products and must use American workers, unless you couldn’t find them. Well, guess what? A lot of them didn’t find them, except me. And I mean it, not a joke. Everything we bill, we bill with American product and with American workers, period. And it doesn’t violate any trade agreement. Thanks to my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we announced over 51,000 new infrastructure projects all across America so far. We’re just getting started, including roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water systems, high-speed affordable internet, all across America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:24)', 'Speech': 'You may remember, my predecessor promised infrastructure week after week after week, for four years and never built a damn thing. Nothing. No, I’m serious. Nothing. And by the way, these projects are going to be using American-made material like American Steel, American Concrete, creating good-paying American jobs, union jobs. Why? As I said, I’ve already said it, but since the 30s, the law said we could do that, and that’s exactly what I’m doing. And we’re buying American, we are selling American. It’s all about America. We buy America and past administrations, including my predecessor, failed to uphold that Buy America provision, not anymore. That’s over. American products and American workers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:14)', 'Speech': 'Look folks, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant law taking on climate change ever anywhere in the world, anywhere in the world. We didn’t get anybody to vote for it other than my Democratic friends. Okay? Well, guess what? That includes billions of dollars in investments in industries of the future, including clean American steel. It’s clean because the way we produce it here emits much less carbon and steel made in China. Last month, my administration announced the largest investment ever in clean manufacturing in American history, in all American history. That included up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across America, $1.5 billion. It’s going to create and support thousands of union jobs, including at Butler Works and over in Lyndora, Pennsylvania. My predecessor and his Republican friends in Congress want to repeal that law that would cut those jobs and it would cut the jobs and repeal the law. I’m serious.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:16)', 'Speech': 'I know when I say these things, you wonder, “Can they possibly be that stupid?” I shouldn’t say it that way, but I’m serious. Think about it. Just check it out. That’s what they want to do, but that’s not all. My predecessor rolled back protections for American workers. He opposed the increase overall federal minimum wage. He put union busters in the National Labor Relations Board, for real. Well, he did. Think what the board looked like before I became president. Not a joke. Not a joke. Meanwhile, since I was sworn in as president because of you, look at what we’ve achieved together. Through my American Rescue Plan and enacted the Butch Lewis Act, the most significant law for union workers, retirees in 50 years. Think of what would happen if we didn’t get that passed? And none of them wanted to help me, but we got it done. It protected the hard-earned pensions of more than 120,000 steelworkers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:16)', 'Speech': 'Folks, you’ve had my back and I promise I have your back. We made that happen while my predecessor never lifted a finger to help. I also increased the federal minimum wage for federal contracts. People appointed the National Labor Relations Board actually care about American workers. So far, we’ve created 15,000,000, as mentioned earlier, new jobs, a record in a term of a president. 492,000 new jobs so far in Pennsylvania alone. Under my predecessor, who’s busy right now, Pennsylvania lost 275,000 jobs. Let’s look at the facts. On my watch, unemployment hasn’t been this low for this long in 50 years. That’s 50 years.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:18)', 'Speech': 'Wages are rising, American manufacturing is booming. We’ve created close to 800,000 new manufacturing jobs since I became president, including 28,000 manufacturing jobs right here in Pennsylvania. We’ve attracted $680 billion, let me say it again, $680 billion in private sector investment in advanced manufacturing and clean energy here in America, including $4 billion just here in the State of Pennsylvania so far.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:46)', 'Speech': 'Folks, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs. Think of the last years where corporate America wanted to go find the cheapest labor in the world, send the jobs overseas and import the product home. Not anymore. Together we’re doing what’s always worked best for this country. We’re investing in all of America and all Americans. We’re building an economy from the middle-out and the bottom-up, not the top-down because when we do that, the poor have a ladder up and the middle class do well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. No, for real.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:32)', 'Speech': 'Look, let me close with this. I just came from my hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania. A place like Pittsburgh that climbs into your heart and never leaves you, and it really doesn’t. My mom didn’t live in Scranton since she was 1954, but when you’d ask mom, where is she from? She says, “Scranton, Scranton.” Well, were you learn basic value set like you do here. “Money doesn’t determine your worth,” I would always be told. Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. My dad used say, “A job’s worth a lot more than a paycheck, pal. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being treated with respect.” And you’d say, “I give my word. These are phrases always use.” He’d say, “Not only being able to have respect, being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it, mean it.”'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:22)', 'Speech': 'Look, everyone, everyone deserves a fair shot, just a fair shot, and we’re going to leave no one behind. Folks, that’s my view of the economy from Scranton, from Pittsburgh, from thousands of working middle-class neighbors all across America. It’s a future we’re building together. As I said, I always think of my dad, I really mean it. My dad, during the war, he didn’t get to go to college. He was from, as they say in Baltimore, “Ballmer.” He was from Baltimore and his father then worked for American Oil Company, moved to Wilmington, then to Scranton, opened up business, opened up stations, but he always would come home and he’d go back and close the business. He didn’t own it. He was a manager dealership. And he’d say, “A job is a lot more than a paycheck,” and it really is. It’s about treating people with dignity. It’s about treating them with respect.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:15)', 'Speech': 'And look, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay folks. Because of you, the American work, I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future, and I mean it, I really truly am. When my son died, I decided I would… He spend a year in Iraq and he… Unfortunately, his hooch was next to a burn pit and he went with one of the most fit guys in his regiment. And he came home with stage IV glioblastoma, more brain injuries for folks fighting in Iraq than any other place in the world. Remember what happened to all those firemen and 9/11? Same thing happened because these burn pits are just awful. They put everything from human waste to… And so I wasn’t going to run, but what happened was when he passed, you remember that right after that… Well, you don’t remember when he passed, in 2015. And I wasn’t going to run. I was going to write a book about inflection points in American history, where the actions we take in a short period of time determine what happens in the next five or six decades.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:32)', 'Speech': 'Well, that’s one of the places we’re at right now. And when those folks came walking out of those fields down in Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying Nazi banners, singing the same garbage that they sang in Hitler streets in Germany in the 30s, carrying torches, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan, and a young woman was killed, I decided that I had to run. I had to run. Our democracy is a stake, and it really is. But you know what changes it? When you make the economy grow, when you stand up and ordinary people have an even shot, and they’re not at all susceptible to the garbage that’s fed from these guys, and it’s pure garbage.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:17)', 'Speech': 'I’m supposed to stop. I should keep going, but folks, look, look, you got to just remember who we are and I can’t… Well, when I left Scranton today, I wanted to go to the War Memorial that has the names of all the Scrantonians who died in World War II etched into a granite wall, because I wanted to see where my uncle, Uncle Bozey Ambrose J. Finnegan, where his name was etched back when D-Day occurred. And on Sunday, the next day, my mother’s four brothers all went down to the recruiting station and joined the military. Every one of them volunteered, and my uncle, they called him Ambrose, [inaudible 00:23:08] they called him Bozey. My uncle Bozey was a hell of an athlete, they tell me when he was a kid. And he became an army Air Corps before the Air Force came along. He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:24)', 'Speech': 'He got shot down in New Guinea and they never found the body because there were a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea. And then my son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, and he came back with stage IV glioblastoma, and they gave, like many of you, risked your lives and you people who gave their lives to the country, they’re heroes. But one of the things that as I was doing that today, I was reminded of what my opponent said in Paris not too long ago. They asked him to go visit American grave sites. He said, no, he wouldn’t do it because they were all suckers and losers. I’m not making that up. Staff will listen and acknowledge it today, suckers and losers. That man doesn’t deserve to be the Commander-in-Chief for my son, my uncle.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:27)', 'Speech': 'So folks, we got a lot of work to do, but I’m confident we can do it, and I mean it. I’ve never been more optimistic about our possibilities as a nation, so let’s go out and get them. Remember, for the United States of America, there’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"
https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/president-biden-delivers-remarks-to-commemorate-earth-day,2024-04-23,President Biden Delivers Remarks to Commemorate Earth Day,"[{'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:53)', 'Speech': 'And if anyone tells you that the United States should not help lead the world in transforming our energy systems away from fossil fuels, understand that they are literally threatening the health and well-being of our children and our grandchildren and the future of the entire planet. And we cannot and will not allow that to happen. All of which brings us to why we are here today. I am proud to have worked for a number of years on a program that will cut carbon emissions, will substantially lower the electric bills of some 900,000 Americans, and, in the process, will create thousands of good-paying jobs. This legislation, Solar for All program, is a win for the environment, a win for consumers, and a win for job creation.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:14)', 'Speech': 'In my state of Vermont and around the country, we are seeing more and more people install solar panels on their roofs. And the reason is simple. When they do that, they cut their electric bills by 70 to 90%, depending upon solar exposure, 70 to 90% reduction in electric bills. That’s huge and amounts, on average, to over $1,200 a year in savings, over $100 a month. The problem is that in order to get those annual savings, you need to make an initial investment. And depending upon the size of your home and where you live, that investment in solar panels may be 10,000 to $20,000, which is a lot of money if you’re an average American. And that is where the Solar for All program comes in.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:29)', 'Speech': 'This program will provide grants and loans to working-class families to help cover the cost of installing solar rooftops or participating in community-based solar projects. Families who have in the past not been able to take advantage of solar panels will now be able to do so. And this program is cost- effective. And I want to thank the EPA for their good work on this. And the EPA projects that it will more than pay for itself. The estimate is that this $7 billion investment will save working families more than 8.7 billion in lower electric bills over the lifetime of these solar panels. In other words, we’re spending seven billion to save more than 8.7 billion, and we’re reducing carbon emissions, and we’re creating jobs. That seems like a pretty good deal to me.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:47)', 'Speech': 'In the 1930s, as I think many of you know, the federal government helped bring electricity to every region of our country as part of the New Deal, and that was a great, great accomplishment. Today, we can lead the world in transforming that energy system away from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy and, in the process, save Americans billions on their electric bills. I want to thank President Biden for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to our continued work together to expand residential solar, to lower the cost of electric bills throughout this country, and to combat the existential threat of climate change. And now I would like to introduce Senator Ed Markey, who has been one of the leaders in the U.S. Senate in environmental issues, who will talk about another exciting part of our agenda that will create good-paying jobs for young people who will be working hard to save the planet. Ed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:41)', 'Speech': 'Climate change is an emergency. It’s putting our present in peril. The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventative care. That’s what these Corps members are going to be doing. The young people aren’t giving up. They’re not backing down or begging for a livable future. You are demanding a livable future, and we stand inspired by you. But more importantly, we stand in solidarity with you. And that’s why Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and I did not agonize; we organized alongside all of you for a 21st century Climate Corps, a job-creating program that would build the workforce for a clean tomorrow while tackling the problems of today, and President Biden delivered on that dream. And that is what we are celebrating here today. On top of the historic billions in climate funding, including for the Solar for All program we celebrate today, we have an historic new American Climate Corps to turn those assets'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:33)', 'Speech': 'We stand in this historic civilian Conservation Corps camp at Prince William Forest Park, taking lessons from our past as we look forward to a better future. We will make sure that our American Climate Corps is ambitious, just, and unapologetically pro-union. That it’s done by and for those who have been locked out and left behind in the past, especially Black and Brown and indigenous communities all across our country, and that our Climate Corps members tackle thousands of projects with one shared purpose. To build a world worth saving, we’ll need all three of the Green New Deal principles, union jobs, environmental justice, and climate action built into this program. Without any one of those pillars, our green temple will fall.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:43)', 'Speech': 'The American Climate Corps members we salute, we celebrate, and call to action today showcase the best of those principles. Generosity, not greed. Excellence, not exploitation. Hope, not hate. Thank you, President Biden. Thank you for your leadership in ensuring that we create this opportunity for young people to save our planet. Thank you to all the present and future American Climate Corps members for showing up in solidarity and in service.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:21)', 'Speech': 'This is the dawn of a new era, and we are just so proud to be with all of you here today. Now it is my great honor to turn the podium over to my great friend, my partner, the inspirational congresswoman from New York City, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:21)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank President Biden for working with us to take swift and bold executive action to protect the planet by launching the American Climate Corps, and also for investing billions in clean, resilient energy via the Solar for All competition among so many other climate victories.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:41)', 'Speech': 'As you’ll hear in today’s announcement, it is no accident that this president is overseeing the single biggest federal investment in tackling the climate crisis in our nation’s history. Over just the past few months, President Biden has paused new natural gas exports, vastly expanded the conservation of our public lands in Alaska, and he has overseen tens of billions of dollars in climate investments across the United States.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:17)', 'Speech': 'Today also serves as a reminder of the power of organizing, of what we can accomplish when young people, climate advocates, labor organizers, and working people of all backgrounds come together to demand the future we all deserve. It is especially important that we remember the power of young people shaping this country today of all days, as we once again witness the leadership of those peaceful student-led protests on campuses like Columbia, Yale, Berkeley, and many others.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:54)', 'Speech': 'Just three years ago, Senator Markey and I introduced the Civilian Climate Corps for Jobs and Justice Act. People said then it was impossible, and to that we said, “Watch us work.” We knew an American Climate Corps wasn’t impossible because our country has done this before. What we needed was … Rather, because we knew that we have done this before. Apologies. We knew that we’ve done this before. What we needed, though, was the political will. It was the power of young people that have made today possible.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:40)', 'Speech': 'This is why I am especially encouraged that President Biden is reviving the idea that inspired our bill, which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt first put forward in 1933, in the creation of the original Civilian Conservation Corps. The CCC, as it was known then, was revolutionary. In the wake of the Great Depression, the CCC put over three million young people to work, created 711 new state parks, and drastically improved our nation’s public lands.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:15)', 'Speech': 'This very park that we are in today is the result of the original Civilian Conservation Corps. Today, over 90 years later, the American Climate Corps will follow in these footsteps and go beyond by giving young Americans a chance to take on the climate crisis while training for the careers of tomorrow.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:41)', 'Speech': 'Just like a century ago, the Climate Corps is part of a vision affirming that our environmental and economic future are intertwined. So let’s invest in both. I truly believe that the young people who joined this first American Climate Corps cohort are and will continue to become profoundly influential leaders in the United States. They will be a part of confronting the climate crisis while building a just economy that works for all of us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:19)', 'Speech': 'So if you are a young person interested in learning the skills to be part of our emerging climate resilience and clean energy workforce, or if you know someone who is, visit climatecorps.gov now and apply today. I applaud President Biden for taking action to create the American Climate Corps, and I look forward to continuing our work in Congress to ensure the growth and success of our climate agenda. Thank you all so very much.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:02)', 'Speech': 'From our little backyard oasis, I could see the impact that fresh fruits and vegetables had on my family’s health. The high school I attended focused on aviation. Between learning how to fly planes and build engines, I also learned how flying and different forms of transit contributed to climate pollution.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:24)', 'Speech': 'For me, transportation was personal. Apart from lacking healthy food options, my entire city lacked reliable transportation. Coming from a big family, cars were expensive, so I had to rely on public transit. A 25-minute car ride to school could easily be a two-hour bus ride. One winter in 10th grade, I got second degree frostbite on all of my toes because I had to walk for miles in the snow when the bus didn’t show up. These experiences inspired me to combine my passions for improving both the environment and public transit systems as an AmeriCorps member. After graduating from Michigan State University last May, I now proudly serve in the Michigan Healthy Climate Corps. I serve at Transportation Riders United. TRU is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing pollution by improving Detroit and the surrounding region’s public transit system.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:40)', 'Speech': 'Thanks to President Biden, I’m so excited to be a part of the inaugural cohort of the American Climate Corps. For young environmentalists like me, it means so much to know that we have a president who understands the importance of climate change, clean energy, and climate justice. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m now honored to introduce to you the President of the United States, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:06)', 'Speech': 'I got to know Senator Gaylord Nelson, from Wisconsin when I got to the Senate and he organized the first Earth Day. I later introduced the first climate bill in the United States Senate and all these years later as president, I was able to sign into the law the Inflation Reduction Act. The most significant investment ever anywhere in the history of the world, and we’re just getting started.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:36)', 'Speech': 'Earth Day pushed the country forward leading to Environmental Protection Agency and we’re fortunate enough to have with us EPA Administrator, Michael Regan. Where are you, Michael? Stand up, get up, get up. I stole him from Carolina, we’re not letting himm go back. We’re joined by our great Secretary of Interior, Deb Haaland. Deb, stand up. The first Native American ever to serve in a cabinet. And AmeriCorps CEO, Michael Smith. Michael, where are you? There you go. Joined by members of the Congress, including Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who by the way, thought this was an important idea a long time ago and talked about dealing with the Climate Corps when it needed one. Ed, we owe you a lot, pal. We owe you a lot.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:34)', 'Speech': 'Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who understands what beautiful territory looks like up in Vermont and has done everything in his power to protect it. Bernie, you’re the best. Representative Ocasio-Cortez of New York. I learned a long time ago, listen to that lady. Listen to that lady. We’re going to talk more about another part of the world too real quickly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:59)', 'Speech': 'Joined by all of your advocates and community leaders, this is a good day. It’s fitting to be here in Prince William Forest Park. On March 31, 1933 during the Great Depression, president Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the Climate Conservation Corps, which is talked about a little bit, to put Americans to work to conserve our country’s natural resources. Thousands, thousands of young Americans from the Civilian Conservation Corps built this park providing jobs, recreation, hope, and healing at the time.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:35)', 'Speech': 'We know today we face another kind of existential threat. It requires equally bold and clear action. As President, I’ve seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand. Since I’ve been president, I’ve flown over all the major fires in the thousands upon thousands of acres that have burned flat by the wildfires. More acres than the entire state of Maryland combined.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:59)', 'Speech': 'I met with families whose homes are wiped off the map by devastating hurricanes, floods, and storms. Last year was Earth Day’s hottest day on record. Over the last two years, natural disasters and extreme weather in America have caused $270 billion, $270 billion in damages. The impacts we’re seeing decades in the making because of inaction are only going to get worse, more frequent, ferocious, and costly.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:32)', 'Speech': 'But since Kamala and I took office, we’ve been acting and today I’m proud to announce two major steps forward. The first, energy costs are among the biggest costs for families to budget, particularly poor, middle-income families. In fact, low-income families can spend up to 30% of their paychecks on their energy bills. It’s outrageous. To reduce family energy costs for folks with low and moderate incomes today, the Environmental Protection Agency will invest $7 billion from our Inflation Reduction Act on a new program called Solar for All.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:12)', 'Speech': 'The award grants 60 grants across the country to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, nonprofits to develop programs that enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from residential solar power, and it’s a big deal. This new Solar for All program means that 900,000 households, 900,000 will have solar on the rooftops for the first time and soon. Millions of families will save over $400 a year in utility bills and that’s $350 million nationwide. My dad said it matters what’s there at the end of the paycheck when the month is out, if you have anything left.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:52)', 'Speech': 'It means we’ll cut more than 5 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually. Folks, solar for all will give us more breathing room and cleaner breathing room. It’s going to also create 200,000 good-paying and union jobs over the five years in communities that need in most, fence-line communities.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:16)', 'Speech': 'As I always say, I think about climate, when I think about it, I think not only about health and safety, but I think about jobs. That brings me to my second announcement. Last fall, I talked about historic new program that my administration was launching with the help of my colleagues on my right here called the American Climate Corps. As I said, and I’m not being solicitous, Ed Markey talked about that long before. It’s patterned after the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps. Like them, it brings out the best in young people to do what’s best for America and will put tens of thousands of young people to work at the forefront of our climate resilience'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:46)', 'Speech': 'To ensure a pathway to good union jobs and careers, you’ll have access to free apprenticeship training through a new partnership we’re announcing today with the North American Building Trade Unions. As you may remember, when I announced in 2020, I initially didn’t announce my climate position until I talked to the unions. Because unions were all… They thought climate cost them jobs. Well, guess what? IABW stepped up and they all stepped up and now our strongest support comes from unions.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:25)', 'Speech': 'When you finish your service, you finish your term of service, you’ll also be eligible for a streamlined path to federal government jobs related to climate and clean energy. We’re also announcing a new collaboration with Bloomberg Philanthropies that puts American Climate Corps members in energy communities, like former coal mining communities, power plant communities that have powered our nation but have been fencelined, communities that have been hurt very badly for generations. Today’s announcement fills upon an unprecedented historic action we’ve already taken to tackle the climate crisis, deliver environmental justice and build a clean energy future. Just look at the last few weeks alone. To ensure clean energy, we issued new standards for chemical plants that emit toxic pollution. And because of the Clean Air Act, we’re going to reduce the number of people at risk for cancer in fenceline communities who have been smothered for decades by pollution, by 96% according to the studies.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:25)', 'Speech': 'By the way, parenthetically, my state of Delaware, which everybody looks at as a wealthy state, I live in a place called Claymont, Delaware. It’s in that arc that goes up into Pennsylvania and to the Delaware River. More energy plants, more oil refineries than anywhere, including Houston, Texas. And just literally, the school I went to was literally a quarter mile from that border. And the prevailing winds were southeast where we lived and so there was never any incentive for the Pennsylvanians to move to do something, but it affected Delaware. We had the highest cancer rate in the 1970s of any state in the nation. And guess what? A lot of us, me included, ended up with bronchial asthma and many other diseases.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:15)', 'Speech': 'Fenceline communities are the ones we have to help first, because they’ve been taking the brunt of all this. To ensure clean drinking water, we issued the first ever national drinking water standard that’ll protect people from exposure to harmful substances known as forever chemicals. And after 30 years of inadequate protections, we finally are going to put a ban on asbestos, which we know causes cancer. It’s all part of a plan to reassert America’s climate leadership. We rejoined the Paris Agreement and sparked the domestic clean energy manufacturing boom, providing incentives for 80,000 farmers to implement climate- smart agricultural practice. So plant what absorbs carbon from the air and pay them for doing it. We’ve quadrupled the number of electric vehicles sold and 11,000 dealerships have now signed up to sell more.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:14)', 'Speech': 'We’re modernizing infrastructure with better roads and highways and energy grids and more, so they can withstand and recover from extreme weather. Already underway, we’re replacing every single lead pipe in America so everyone can turn on a faucet, home or at school, and drink clean water that doesn’t contain lead. We also reviewing flood risk for communities, improving drought resilience, and conserving 41 million acres of the most precious and sacred lands and water. I committed that I’m going to try to reserve… Of all non-developed land and waters, we’re going to take 30% of it by 2030 and make sure it is conserved, period. We’re well on our way. We’ve already attracted at least $700 billion in private sector investments in advanced manufacturing and clean energy, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And all across the board we’re lifting up communities and workers too often left out, in urban, rural, suburban, tribal communities all across the country.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (35:23)', 'Speech': 'But folks, despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny climate is in crisis. Our MAGA Republican friends don’t seem to think it’s in crisis. They actually want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act which provides the funding for a vast majority of these projects and roll back protections for clean air and clean water. And I’m not going to go into it now, but I’m not making it up. It’s real. Just listen to what they say. Anyone in or out of government who willfully denies the impacts of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future, and the world, I might add. They want to take us backwards, sideline our workers, let China and others lead the race for clean energy. I’m determined, absolutely determined, that we move forward. We move forward.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:22)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. In 1933, and it was referenced by the Congresslady, that when Roosevelt outlined the Civilian Conservation Corps, he said, and I’m quoting, “More important than the material gains will be the moral and spiritual value of such work.” He always put it in a context that went beyond just what the immediate need was. I’d say the same holds true for what we’re doing here today. It has a moral imperative. And I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. We just have to remember who we are. We’re the United States of America, and there’s nothing beyond our capacity. We work together. So Happy Earth Day folks, and God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. We’re going to get this done, I promise you, come hell or high water. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, guys. Let’s get this done, okay? All right. God bless y’all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'}]"

Yes. Welcoming back… Welcoming back President Joe Biden to his beloved Syracuse, we know he loves it here best, with a homecoming of this magnitude. The president and I have a few things in common. First, we’re both Irish Catholic Democrats from blue-collar towns. We also went to Syracuse University, and we bleed orange. We both lived in this community. We walked the streets. We know the people, and we know what it means to this community to land the largest private sector investment in our nation’s history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:27)', 'Speech': 'This region for so long has dreamed of regaining the preeminence and the glory of the yesteryears that was first propelled by the economic expansion brought by the Erie Canal, need I say, built by the Irish a long time ago as well. Following the Erie Canal, all these businesses found their way here. Carrier Corporation, GE, Chrysler, all these companies believed in this area, until one day they were gone, woke up and they were gone. They went south, they went overseas. I grew up just down the road, Lackawanna, Buffalo, saw the same thing. Everything we felt was part of our identity was gone. And it has a chilling effect on the psychology of a community, and it lasts a long, long time. And you start to give up hope. You question, are better days really behind us? Businesses left. Empty factories became symbolic with the community. Families left. My family left. Families here left because there were no jobs. Unemployment went up and hope washed away.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:59)', 'Speech': 'And yet this community never, ever gave up on itself. They always believed, the belief in their people and their resources, their assets, their educational institutions. And they worked hard to be prepared for just that day when that opportunity would come knocking on their door. So they were ready, they were hungry, they were excited. And we never believed that it would happen so soon in our lifetime. The next generation finally see a revolution that would change this community forever. My friends, that day has not only arrived, but the future has arrived with it. The future has arrived, starting here today. Welcome to the future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:54)', 'Speech': 'And what brought us to this day? A growth-oriented company with a clear vision of the future, all the way from the great State of Idaho, Sanjay Mehrotra and Micron, I welcome you. We’ll make you honorary New Yorkers starting today. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:20)', 'Speech': 'And then while we’re mentioning the great State of Idaho, we have our governor, Brad Little, who’s come all the way here because there’s a synergy between Boise, Idaho and Central New York, and they’re going to be sharing so many ideas and opportunities. So I want to give a round of applause to Governor Brad Little who has joined us.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:40)', 'Speech': 'But let me throw out a number, my friends. $100 billion. Unprecedented. Unbelievable. Not just for New York, but for the entire nation. Micron’s Clay megafab will power a regional transformation and forever shape New York’s role in the global economy. And none of it would be possible without President Joe Biden and his commitment from the CHIPS and Science Act. President Biden knows all about manufacturing. He knows that means supporting not just legacy businesses, but here we have an opportunity to manufacture the future, semiconductors that used to power everything that is important in our lives. And he knows it’s also the key to good paying union jobs in the construction and beyond. He knows this, he sees this, and that’s why he’s fighting. He knows that’s how we grow the middle class.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:55)', 'Speech': 'I also want to thank majority leader Chuck Schumer for navigating this through the Senate, but also the indispensable role he played in helping land Micron right here. Because the federal CHIPS Act created incentives to bring businesses back here, but they could have gone anywhere in America. We wanted to make sure that New York was competitive.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:20)', 'Speech': 'I also want to thank the members of the New York delegation who supported this, except for the five who declared that this would be a disaster. You can look it up. This otherwise bipartisan bill got over the finish line. I want to thank my team at Empire State Development led by Hope Knight, Kevin Younis, who this is personal to, Kevin Younis, Hope. And also President Biden, you know how to find talent. Gina Raimondo is a rock star. I know she’s in Africa today, but she is here in our hearts for her incredible work and the entire team at the White House who made this happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:58)', 'Speech': 'So from the moment the president signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, I knew we had to move quickly here in New York. I’m a little bit competitive. I was not going to lose to some other state that jumped ahead of us. So literally, I met Manish and members of the Micron team. I had been governor, I think, about five days. I think they were the first ones to show me where my conference room was. And they sat there and told me their vision, but they needed things to happen. They need the CHIPS and Science Act. They would need help from the state. They need help from the locals. And I knew we had a race to make New York the most competitive place in the nation to deliver this, and have a fighting chance.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:40)', 'Speech': 'So, literally two days after the federal law was signed, I signed New York’s Green CHIPS Bill and said, “We’re right there with you. We’ll make sure this happens in our own state.” That is a $10 billion initiative to do the extra incentives that communities need and businesses need. We did it here in New York. So state money, federal money, sent out the message across the world, New York is where you want to be. So, that’s what has happened here today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:13)', 'Speech': 'And two months later, we landed Micron. One of the happiest days of my life. But the next question was, where does it go? We’re going to have them come to New York. Well, this is where I want to thank County Executive Ryan McMahon and everybody in the county, your economic development team, your planning team, because you had a shovel-ready site right here in Clay. The tax abatements, the assistance you did, extraordinary. So what a great combination.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:44)', 'Speech': 'Let me tell you what this adds up to. This is what you get when you have state, federal, and local government working hand-in-hand. $7.1 billion from the State of New York, $6.1 billion from the federal government, $5.2 billion from Onondaga County. That’s worth the investment to get over $100 billion, don’t you think? I think that’s a good return on our money. But it’s not just the $100 billion investment. It’s the 50,000 jobs that follow which will transform this region forever. That’s what gets the round of applause in my mind. 50,000 good paying jobs. 20 years of building, 5,600 union construction jobs. Anybody here from union? Let’s hear it from them as well. Central New York President Greg Lancette. Is Greg Lancette here? I called you up, Greg. I said, “Greg, make this happen. Don’t call me if you don’t get this done.” And you got it done, Greg, so thank you. Thank you very much.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:59)', 'Speech': 'You’ll hear from representatives from Micron about all the things they’re doing, the child care, the apprenticeship programs, the investment in the local YWCA. I personally believe, as a mom who had struggled and had to leave a great job I had working for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a long time ago, I had to leave because I couldn’t get child care. No more. We’re calling on companies, step up and do your part. Micron said, “Of course we will.” Right now they’re building child care on site. That’s what a visionary company does. That’s what every company should be doing, so more moms can get into the workforce.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:38)', 'Speech': 'Let me close. I believe in this state. I believe we are on the cusp of greatness. I believe in this power the state for too long have been overlooked. Hard-hit communities are going to now see opportunities where they never could have dreamed to be. New life, vitality, and energy. But above all, we’re changing the psychology of this community and all of upstate New York. People realize their communities matter. They have value. And so, in so doing, we’re restoring something that has been long elusive in this area. We’re bringing back hope. President Biden, thank you for bringing hope back to upstate New York and will forever be changed because of you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (13:18)', 'Speech': 'I also did want to take a moment, as the governor did, to reflect the reality that our community’s been through for the last week and a half. The tragic loss of two of our superheroes, Officer Jensen and Lieutenant Hoosock. As we’ve gotten to know their stories more, it doesn’t push the pain away, it actually makes it a little bit stronger. But the reality is, these were superheroes in our community. These were people who loved their families, loved their brothers and sisters in law enforcement, and loved this community, and actually gave the ultimate sacrifice for this community. And we are all in awe of that sacrifice. And because of that, we need to continue the work to honor them and to honor that sacrifice.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:06)', 'Speech': 'And that’s what today’s kind of about. It’s about the moment we have in front of us. As a community, we need to meet that moment. And what a story we all have to share. A story about vision, a story about ambition, a story about a community that is hungry and aligned. A story about bold bipartisan partnerships. And from that framework, look at the results. The White Pine Business Park, the country’s greatest megasite, right here in Onondaga County. Then you transition to Green CHIPS, with the State of New York stepping up to the plate in a major way. And I want to thank the governor, and I want to thank all of our state partners for that. Then you talk about the investment tax credit that Senator Schumer helped champion through the Senate and through Congress. Amazingly important. And here we are today with a presidential visit, the second in less than two years, from President Biden to talk about the CHIPS and Science Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:06)', 'Speech': 'When you put those pieces together and you lay out that puzzle, what you get is the greatest memory technology company in the world making the largest investment in their company’s history, and the largest private sector investment in the State of New York and the United States of America. Simply breathtaking.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (15:28)', 'Speech': 'So you’re going to hear from some really important people soon, but that, my friends, is an American story, and that is your story.

Congratulations.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:20)', 'Speech': 'Now, it is so good to be here on such an important day for this community’s future and for America’s future. First, he’s not wearing the orange socks, but he’s Syracuse all the way, let’s give it up for our great guest president, Joe Biden. Mr. President, welcome back to Syracuse. This city will always be home for you.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:54)', 'Speech': 'Now, this is a historic day, a historic investment, a historic moment for Syracuse, for Upstate New York, and for all of America. Today we celebrate one of the largest federal investments for a single project ever in Upstate New York. Thanks to our CHIPS and Science Law, $6 billion dollars, that’s with a B, will supercharge Micron to build the most advanced memory chip factory in the world right here in Syracuse, in Central New York. The most advanced chip memory factory in the world right here. So, we are building, we are rebuilding Upstate New York’s economy one microchip at a time!'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:56)', 'Speech': 'Our country will be more economically secure because of Micron. Our national security will be stronger because of Micron. And Syracuse, Central New York, and Upstate New York’s economy will be more prosperous because of Micron. This expansion will bring nearly 50,000 good paying jobs, enough to fill every seat in the JMA Dome. The funding will help Micron invest a record more than $100 billion in Upstate. Folks, this is the largest single private investment in all of New York State’s history, and one of the largest investments ever in the nation’s history. Is not that great?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:57)', 'Speech': 'And Micron, which has always been such a progressive company, is doing this while supporting quality jobs, above and beyond when compared to the rest of the industry. Every square foot of Micron’s massive expansion, the size of 40 football fields, will be built with good-paying union construction jobs, the largest PLA, Project Labor Agreement, ever in American history. And listen to this: Micron is the only company providing child care to its workers on all of their sites. Micron is fully committed to building an inclusive and diverse workforce. And Micron is publicly committed to the rights of workers to form and join unions and collectively bargain. Micron is leading the way as the only major company to agree to sit down with unions and have a conversation about the future of their workforce. Very soon, very soon the world’s most advanced memory chips will be recognized by a simple phrase that will be known around the world: “Made in Upstate New York.”.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:44)', 'Speech': 'For the first time in 20 years, we are bringing back leading-edge memory chip production to the U.S. That loss of manufacturing is all too familiar for the families in this community and in all of Upstate New York. I still shake with anger when the head of UT, United Technologies, told me they were going to shut down and move operations of Carrier out of Syracuse to Asia. I still am infuriated when I remember him saying that. So, I made it my mission to change that. I wrote and crafted the CHIPS and Science Law with Syracuse and Upstate New York as my north star. I wrote the bill with this day in mind and here we are.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:39)', 'Speech': 'Oh, yeah. Today this vision becomes a reality, and the bill delivers bigger for Central New York than I even imagined. And I had a big memory for that, a large, grand memory at first. Now, it took a lot of work to get the CHIPS bill over the finish line. It wasn’t easy to convince everyone in Congress about the importance of this bill. But I kept pushing and pushing and pushing because I knew the huge stakes for Central New York and for our country. Because of CHIPS and Science, the law we passed, and we did it bipartisan, America’s future will be built in Syracuse, not in Shanghai!'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:29)', 'Speech': 'And folks, during those intense days, those final days that Congress negotiated the bill, I spoke with CEOs like Sanjay, who told me emphatically that, if we fail to enact the incentives contained in the CHIPS bill, companies like Micron would have to look overseas to other countries to build these fabs. It’s no exaggeration to say that without CHIPS and Science, investments like Micron would not have been possible, and the future for Upstate New York might have looked very, very different.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:05)', 'Speech': 'So, to all those who had had their doubts: Micron is here, Micron is real, it’s never going away. We’re here for good, and this is going to be great.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:19)', 'Speech': 'And today, the Federal Government is betting big on the bright future for Upstate New York. And Micron is not the only one. I’ve been working hard to get the benefits throughout the state. We have GlobalFoundries in the Capital Region, Wolfspeed in Utica, Edwards Vacuum in Genesee County between Rochester and Buffalo, and so much more. And it’s not just New York, although we’re doing damn well, it’s Idaho and Ohio and Arizona and Texas and New Hampshire and more are seeing new investments and new jobs thanks to CHIPS and Science. We are bringing back manufacturing jobs to America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:06)', 'Speech': 'And I want to thank the person who made this great moment possible, and that is President Joe Biden. Upstate New York is proud to call President Biden one of our own. And Syracuse is part of the President’s DNA, he knows the struggle people here face to make ends meets. He’s seen it. He’s lived it, through his family. For him, it’s personal. He knows we must invest in places like Syracuse to create an economy that lifts everyone, from the bottom up and the middle out.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:52)', 'Speech': 'And while she is not here, I want to thank Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Deputy Secretary Graves, who deserve so much credit for this investment. I knew from our very first conversation when I was beginning to conceive this law that she got it. She knew the importance of reviving American manufacturing and rebuilding Upstate New York.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:17)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank Governor Kathy Hochul and her Empire State Development team. She has been a genuine partner with us on many of these endeavors, including landing Micron and making New York a global hub of the microchip industry. And someone special: County Executive McMahon. Ryan, your vision on finding that plot of land. When I started trying to woo companies here, they said, “Do you have a site ready place?” A lot of places didn’t. Syracuse did because of you, Ryan. So he made sure how a plot of land in Clay, New York, could grow into a field of dreams for new investment.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:58)', 'Speech': 'I want to thank Mayor Walsh, Rob Simpson of CenterState, Greg Lancette of the local Building Trades, and so many other great union leaders from across the state and across the country who are here to celebrate this wonderful moment, and who worked with us to bring Micron to New York.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:17)', 'Speech': 'And last but not least, let me also thank my friend, Sanjay Mehrotra. Since the first time we talked about all New York has to offer, and he made us jump through a whole lot of hoops, he has been a man of his word. Sanjay has shown time and again about how much he cares about the country, about bringing new life back to Upstate New York, about investing in the workers, he cares about his workers. Sanjay deserves tremendous credit for his leadership and commitment to making one of the largest investments in the nation’s history. Just like the Federal Government, he and Micron are betting big, not just on the U.S., but on Upstate New York.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (28:06)', 'Speech': 'So, Sanjay, come on out here.

None of this would have been possible without the CHIPS and Science Act.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (29:49)', 'Speech': 'And there are so many who contributed to make this day happen. President Biden, thank you for your vision to invest in America and manufacture leading-edge semiconductors that are critical to emerging technologies. Secretary Raimondo, I’m sorry that you are not able to attend today, but I know your team is here, who are at the center of the CHIPS implementation. Majority Leader Schumer, your relentless tenacity to build a bipartisan coalition led to the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. Governor Hochul, the New York Green CHIPS Program and the Community Investment Framework you led will revitalize the semiconductor ecosystem across upstate New York. Onondaga County Executive McMahon, your foresight and collaborative approach was essential to ensure that Micron had the land available, more than a thousand acres of land, to build the mega fab of the future here, the mega fab cluster of the future.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (30:56)', 'Speech': 'Leader Schumer, Governor Hochul, and County Executive McMahon, you have been instrumental in bringing Micron to New York.

Thank you both for traveling to be with us today.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (31:52)', 'Speech': 'I really want to thank each one of you. The collective persistence and vision of this bipartisan group has created a generational opportunity for American semiconductor manufacturing. And I would be remiss if I did not thank my board. Two of the board members, Lynn Dugle and Linnie Haynesworth, are here today with us. We are really honored to have you. And I have to say thank you for your support, your relentless support through the various challenges that we faced as we finalized to come to this day. So on behalf of all of Micron team, thank you to our board, as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (32:43)', 'Speech': 'This is an extraordinarily proud moment for Micron, a company that was founded by four engineers in Boise, Idaho, 45 years ago. Today we are a global innovation powerhouse. More than 40,000 team members worldwide, more than 56,000 patents that our team members have contributed over the history of the company. We are very proud of those roots. And I know our team with its expertise in technology, manufacturing, and products, really looks forward to building a leading-edge memory manufacturing here in America.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (33:22)', 'Speech': 'The investment we are announcing today will build two leading-edge memory manufacturing fabs here in New York and one additional fab in Idaho alongside our research and development facility there.

These fabs, we also like to call them clean room, each one of them will cover the size of 10'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (34:52)', 'Speech': 'Memory and storage have never been more critical to our world. Memory is everywhere today. It’s in your smartphones, it’s in your personal computers, it’s in the data center, it’s in your cars, it’s in critical infrastructure. And Micron is a global technology leader, global leader in memory. And the products we make in the US will be used worldwide everywhere in innovative devices. And just in the short time, just 18 months ago, that we were here when we announced this project, our industry has seen the beginnings of a tremendous growth phase driven by disruptive artificial intelligence technologies. Generative AI didn’t exist or was not known to the world the way it is known today. Generative AI will transform nearly every aspect of life. Every business and every society will be transformed. Businesses will be unleashed with greater efficiencies. Manufacturing will be revolutionized. Scientific breakthroughs will occur, and it will provide for new medical treatments. And this is unquestionably the most exciting time that I have seen in my 40 plus year career. It is so exciting because memory is a key enabler of all of the AI technologies and solutions today. The low power, the high performance memory chips, are critical for data-intensive artificial intelligence workloads. It’s really chips like this, a chip that is thin as a fingernail, small as a fingernail, and this chip has 32 billion bits of data in it. This is what Micron leads the world today in manufacturing. This is what will also be in the future generations of memory chips.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (36:54)', 'Speech': 'Think about it. This chip actually has a million times more capacity than the massive computer that had sent the first man on the moon. And then you also got another one, size of my thumbnail. This is high bandwidth memory. 12 chips are stacked in this very, very thin package here. This is nearly 10 times more capacity than this other little chip that I had just shown you. These tiny powerful memory stacks hold the keys to artificial technology breakthroughs. In fact, all semiconductor companies, we believe Micron will be one of the greatest beneficiaries of the opportunity driven by AI, amidst all semiconductor companies. And that translates into great opportunities for New York here, and of course, for Idaho as well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (37:54)', 'Speech': 'Over the past 30 years, semiconductor manufacturing largely moved overseas and the cost to build and manufacture in the US grew to more than 35% higher than in Asia. Today, less than 2% of the world’s total memory production is here in the US, but that is going to change now with the CHIPS Act. With the CHIPS Act support, with local and state support, the cost gap will be narrowed, allowing Micron to make the US home to the most advanced memory manufacturing in the world. We’ll go from that 2% today to nearly 10% in a little more than a decade, and that is really moving the needle. And that needle will be moved right here with the large volume manufacturing here in Clay, New York.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (38:58)', 'Speech': 'And memory manufacturing requires the largest scale in the semiconductor industry, and our plants reflect that. Altogether, these fabs will be capable of producing billions of chips per year, attracting a large ecosystem of suppliers across nearly all 50 states. We project that our investments will help create several tens of thousands of American jobs over the next 20 years, more than 50,000 jobs here in New York, and over 20,000 jobs in Idaho. Those numbers include direct Micron jobs, indirect community jobs, and thousands of skilled construction workers to build these advanced fabs. We are actively investing in communities across New York and Idaho to deploy the education, training, and up-skilling programs needed to develop a diverse and inclusive workforce of the future. We have community investment framework established in New York and Idaho to further advance the communities and the workforce of the future. But we are not just creating jobs, we are creating careers. For years, Micron has been actively fostering the next generation of US technology talent across multiple avenues. We are partnering with educators to build foundational STEM curriculum, working with colleges and universities on semiconductor programs and opening non-traditional pathways to reach women, veterans, rural communities, underrepresented groups, and all adults at all stages of their careers. And we are working diligently to spark more interest in STEM among children. Our partnership with great organizations, like this Museum of Science and Technology, are critical to opening the imagination of our youth. Through all these aspects that I have discussed today, Micron is not only building its memory manufacturing fabs here in New York and Idaho, Micron is building a world-class semiconductor ecosystem. This is long-term generational transformation, creating new careers, new skill sets, new factories, to support precision equipment and materials, a complete industry infrastructure. All of that will be firmly anchored here in America and drive future US semiconductor leadership.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (41:40)', 'Speech': 'I want to close with a thank you to Micron team, those who work so tirelessly to analyze and recommend these two projects and bring them to this day today, of these historic milestones. I want to thank everyone at Micron who drives our technology, our manufacturing, our product leadership. I want to thank all those that have contributed over the 45-year journey to make Micron into an iconic company that it is today. Your heart, your tenacity, your brilliant ideas, all built this iconic company. With these projects, so much more of America will see what you can do.

We invented them. We made the move, we modernized them, but over time we stopped. We used to have 40% of this market, and over time we stopped making them. So when the pandemic shut down chip factory overseas, prices of everything went up at here at home.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (51:55)', 'Speech': 'That semiconductor shortage drove one-third of the surge in inflation in 2021. Caused long wait lines of all kinds of products. Folks, I determined that I’m never going to let us be vulnerable to wait lines again. Where it’s essential, we’re going to make it here in America and together… And by the way, that’s not hyperbole, that’s literal.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (52:22)', 'Speech': 'Together with Schumer leader and I, we took action to make sure these chips are made in America again creating tens of thousands and I mean tens of thousands of good-paying jobs.

That is what we are building together. On the one hand, it actually helps to have a big company, like Microsoft that can build a strong foundation that can support every small business and nonprofit everywhere, but more than that, as you all know, it takes a community. One thing that I’ve always felt is so important about the work we are doing here is to under-promise, over-deliver, and work with the community. That’s what I learned growing up here. It’s the way to do business here. That is what we’re doing with all of you, and the partnerships that have come together are truly, in my view, inspiring. It’s our work with technical college to create a data center economy that will train more than 1000 people to fill the operational jobs that this new facility will require.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:10)', 'Speech': 'It’s the partnership with the United Way of Racine County, with the state of Wisconsin, and with other partners. We will train more than 100,000 people in Wisconsin by the end of the decade. So they have the AI skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow. One of the most exciting things that I think we’re launching today is a new initiative, the first of its kind of the United States, a manufacturing-focused AI co-innovation lab. It will be at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee at the Connected Systems Institute. We, literally, will have the opportunity to help hundreds of companies, hundreds of manufacturing companies, come in so they can design new AI-based systems that will ensure that Wisconsin manufacturing remains at the forefront of global competitiveness. The partnerships that we’re building on, this is building not only on great work that’s been going on in Milwaukee at the Connected Systems Institute. This builds on this long-standing partnership that we’ve had at Green Bay at Title Town Tech, co-founded in 2019 by Microsoft and the Green Bay Packers.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:45)', 'Speech': 'And now we are connecting Title Town Tech with UW-Milwaukee, and oh my gosh, thank you to Mark Murphy and Ed Policy, as you all know, there are two things that unite the people of Wisconsin: God and the Green Bay Packers. We could do none of this without the local labor leaders that are involved, the leaders of the IBEW, the leaders of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union, and we’re so pleased, in my view, to be joined today by Liz Shuler, the National President of the AFL-CIO. I have learned so much from Liz about how a great technology company and a great set of labor organizations can forge the kind of partnership that will create the jobs and opportunity for the people, not just of today, but for the future. Then, I just want to say it starts at the local level. Mount Pleasant, what an extraordinary place. When I look at Dave DeGroot, the village president, when I see the county executive for Racine, for the mayor of Racine, governor Evers, from his first meeting with me, to do the things that needed to be done to make this happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:16)', 'Speech': 'But I want you to know something else because I think it’s especially fitting on a day like today. Everything that we are doing here in Racine County, Wisconsin is also benefiting directly from the work of this White House and this president over the last four years. Every day you see the news of the day, but what really matters is the work over a number of years. In 2021, this president sat down across the aisle and persuaded our Congress to pass a bipartisan infrastructure law, a bipartisan infrastructure law that is investing in the roads and bridges that are needed to bring the steel to this plant that have injected more than $1 billion into a cause in which we’ve long believed bringing broadband connectivity to everyone in the state of Wisconsin. That’s a part of this. Then, again, in 2022, it took people coming together in Washington to pass the Chips and Science Act, because believe me, a data center without chips doesn’t do very much for anybody.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:35)', 'Speech': 'And again, in 2022, because of the Inflation Reduction Act, it became possible to aim higher, to achieve the climate and energy goals that also are indispensable to what we need to do as a company and all of us need to do as a community right here. Then, last year, in 2023, this White House, this administration, and this president really led the tech sector in the country and even the world to recognize how much AI was changing the world, but that we need to ensure that it’s safe, that it’s secure, that it’s used responsibly, and they brought people together so we could move fast to do precisely that. Finally, every day since the first day of the inauguration in 2021, I just have to say, as someone who spends part of every single day working on and worrying about the cybersecurity protection of our customers in this nation, no administration has done as much as this administration to protect the cybersecurity of our communities and our country as a whole.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (08:55)', 'Speech': 'It takes all kinds of people that find a way to get things done. As I introduce the person who will introduce the president, the person who is doing the recruiting to bring in the people that will build the building, that will house the technology, that will serve the world, Nick Fick, who comes from the IBEW right here in Racine. Let me leave you with one final thought. I hope that with everything else that’s going on in the world today, people here in Wisconsin and people across the country will just take a moment to remember this. This day shows something important. It shows that America remains what it has always been. We are a country where people come together, where people work together, where they address hard challenges and we get great things done. We won’t let you down. Please welcome Nick Fick.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:20)', 'Speech': 'Microsoft plans to spend billions of dollars to build data centers on the same property Foxconn has abandoned. Now Local 430 members are installing temporary power and lighting, along with the preliminary underground work needed, and this is just the start. They are calling this site Microsoft’s Crown Jewel, the biggest footprint of any Microsoft facility in the world. That means long-term work for hundreds of skilled professional IBEW electricians for 10 to 15 years. Now I have the good fortune to have the job here at home, organizing electricians into the IBEW. Thank you. Thanks to Joe Biden, advanced manufacturing jobs are coming back to America and back to our hometown. We are grateful to Microsoft for investing in America and here in Mount Pleasant and also to President Biden who promised to bring infrastructure back to bring manufacturing back, to bring good paying union jobs back. Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden keeps his promises. It is an honor for me to introduce to you the President of the United States of America, Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:40)', 'Speech': 'It is always great to be with one of the best governors in America, Tony Evers. I think of Tony, I mean it, I think of one word, integrity. You’re a man of absolute integrity. What I’m really doing, I’m really auditioning for a job with a little company that’s going to build something out here. Thank you for the comments you made about what we’re doing together. Well look, while she couldn’t be here, I want to thank one of the best US senators in the United States of American, and a good friend of mine, Tammy Baldwin. You also got a great mayor in Racine, Cory Mason, Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. Thank you for your partnership, for showing how we can get things done and big things done in America, and thank you for your friendship. I really mean it. Liz Shuler, president of [inaudible 00:15:57], thank you for all you do to benefit the American Union movement. I got called the most pro-union president American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (16:04)', 'Speech': 'I make no apologies for it. I’m serious. Middle class build America, but unions built the middle class. I’ve been saying that for a long time. Folks, I’m here to talk about a great comeback story in America, and I’m sure you remember. Racine was once a manufacturing boom town, all the way through the 1960s. Power companies invented a manufacturing Windex, portable vacuum cleaners and so much more, and powered by middle class jobs. Then, came trickle-down economics, cut taxes for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations again in the 60s. We shipped American jobs overseas, because labor was cheaper. We slashed public investment in education and innovation, and the result, we hollowed out the middle class. My predecessor and his administration doubled down on that failed trickle-down economics, along with the trial of broken promises. Look, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joe,” John, I mean this sincerely. My dad was a well-read man, never got to go to college, but he was a good man all across the board.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (17:24)', 'Speech': ""He’d say, “Joey, remember. A job’s a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your integrity, it’s about your dignity. It’s about being treated with respect. It’s about being to look at your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay.'” In fact, six years ago when my predecessor came to Racine with the promise of “reclaiming our country’s proud manufacturing legacy,” we had an infrastructure every day, every week for four years, didn’t build a damn thing. His administration promised a $10 billion investment by Foxconn to build new manufacturing complex, create 13,000 new jobs. In fact, he came here with your senator, Ron Johnson, literally holding a golden shovel, promising to build the eighth wonder of the world. Are you kidding me? Look what happened. They dug a hole with those golden shovels, and then they fell into it. Look, they didn’t shovel other dirt. They did shovel some dirt. 100 homes were bulldozed.""}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:38)', 'Speech': 'They wasted hundreds of millions of dollars, your state and local tax dollars, to promise a project that never happen. Foxconn turned out to be just that, a con. Go figure. In just four years, under his administration, instead of creating 13,000 jobs in Racine, my predecessor and 1000 manufacturing jobs, rather than creating 1000 manufacturing jobs, left Racine. 83,500 total jobs left Wisconsin during my predecessor’s term, but that’s not on my watch. We’re determined to turn it around. Thus far, since we’ve come to office, and with the governor’s overwhelming leadership, we’ve created over 178,000 jobs in Wisconsin, and we’re going to create more here in Racine and big time. Some of my friends in the far right have criticized my investing in American agenda, which includes my bipartisan infrastructure law, the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. A lot of businesses support it as a key to economic growth that we’re seeing now. Remember here, you’re going to have a recession next week, recession next week, no soft landing.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:00)', 'Speech': 'Well, in fact, I’ve asked business leaders, like Brad, a simple question, “When the United States decides to invest considerable resources in the new industry that we need to build, does that encourage or discourage them engaging?” The answer overwhelming is it encourages business investment and that’s what we’re seeing now with our administration. My investing in America agenda is fueling historic boom, and rebuilding our roads and bridges, developing and deploying clean energy, revitalizing American manufacturing and so much more. So far, we’ve created $866 billion in private sector investment nationwide, almost a trillion dollars. Historic amounts in such a short time. Now it’s literally creating of thousands of jobs, building new semiconductor factories, electric vehicles and battery factories and so much more here, all here in America today. It’s another example of the private sector optimism. Microsoft, as the president already pointed out, is investing $3.3 billion to build a new data center here in Racine that’s going to help operate one of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems in the world.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:12)', 'Speech': 'I’ve gone around the world, literally, not figuratively, meeting with the leading architects of AI. It’s going to result in 2,300 union construction jobs, just to build a new facility and 2000 permanent workers to work in the data centers. In addition, we’re also providing a pipeline to train for these new jobs, a pipeline that starts right here at this very spot. Microsoft is partnering with Gateway Technical Community College right here to train and certify 200 students a year to fill high-demand, good-paying jobs, and data and IT at Microsoft’s new AI day center here in Racine, but that’s not all. In addition, Microsoft is continuing to pipeline, going to high schools and nearby Mount Pleasant to train high school students for jobs of the future. As the boss pointed out, it’s going to create 100,000 jobs over time. It’s all part of Microsoft’s broad plan to build artificial intelligence ecosystem right here in Racine, and it’s going to be transformative, not just here but worldwide.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (22:27)', 'Speech': 'It’s not only significant investment in infrastructure Racine, but for the people of Racine. It means folks are getting trained. Folks are getting trained in new high-paying, high-skilled jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and don’t require you to leave home. Where I come from, that really matters. I know what it’s like when your parents have to move the family in search of work because of no jobs, what it does to the family’s dignity. My wife, Jill, who teaches full-time at a community college cares a lot about this as well. Last year she announced our first five workforce hub sites to build a pipeline of workers in industries that are creating new hometowns in Phoenix, Baltimore, Columbus, Ohio, Augusta, Georgia, pulling everything from semiconductors to electric vehicles. Last month I announced four new hubs to continue to train workers for the jobs of the future, one of which is in Milwaukee that trains workers to help replace every poisonous lead pipe in America and a decade of funded by the infrastructure law.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:43)', 'Speech': 'By the way, Buy America has been the law of the land since the 30s, but it’s been ignored by most administration. Past administration, including my predecessors, have failed to buy America. Not anymore. Here’s how it works. When the Congress sends something to the president to bill something, whether it’s a road, a highway, deck of an aircraft carrier, whatever it is, that president’s being backed from law that’s passed in the 30s. It’s supposed to hire American workers to build it and use American products. Well, on my watch and Tammy’s leadership, federal projects like the Blatnik Bridge, here in Wisconsin, it’s going to cost $1 billion, but it’s going to be all-American made, all-American products, and all-American workers, and it’s going to create 10,000 new jobs, 10,000. In addition, the roads, highways, and so much more would be made with American products built by American workers, creating good-paying American jobs. What’s happening in Racine is really important for another reason. We’ll see more technical community colleges, technical changes needed in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:59)', 'Speech': 'AI is already driving that change in every part of American life, from how we teach and learn, to how we solve the biggest challenges, from curing cancer to climate change. America is a global leader in AI, and American companies lead the world in AI innovation and a lot of what we’re going to see here in Racine. Because of our initiatives, American workers will power that innovation here in America. But look, to get the full benefit of all this safeguards, we need safeguards. That’s why as the president pointed out, I signed the Landmark Executive order on which the most significant action any government has taken anywhere in the world, has ever taken for AI safety, security, and trust. This order helps make sure workers have a seat at the table in determining how these technologies are developed and used. For real, and we’ll support workers in every industry by defending the right to a fair wage to organize as these technologies emerge across the board, and they’re going to happen.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:09)', 'Speech': 'Folks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises, which he broke more than kept, left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine. On my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. We leave no one behind. Since I took all of us, we’ve added nearly 4,000 jobs in Racine. As I said earlier, we’ve added 178,000 in the state of Wisconsin. The unemployment rate has hit a record in Racine. Racine has seen some of the strongest new business growth in all of Wisconsin, and it’s only just beginning. We’re seeing a great American comeback story all across Wisconsin and, quite frankly, the entire country. The bottom line is we’re doing what’s always worked in this country, giving people a fair shot, leaving nobody behind and grow the economy in the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (27:18)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. When folks see a new factory being built here in Wisconsin, people going to work, making a really good wage in their hometowns, I hope they feel the pride that I feel, pride in their hometowns making a comeback, pride in knowing we can get big things done in America still. And folks, I’ve never been more optimistic, and I’ve only been around a couple of years. I know I don’t look it, but I’m a 40-plus-2 type. Well, anyways. But I swear to God, I’ve never been more optimistic about our future. We just have remember who [inaudible 00:27:55] we are. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. Nothing. I mean that. Nothing. The rest of the world looks to us, so keep it going. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Don’t jump.'}]"

You know I’m not. And it’s the best thing that’s happened to me. Scripture says, “The prayers of a righteous man availeth much.” In Augusta, Georgia, a righteous man, once enslaved, set foot for freedom.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (01:28)', 'Speech': 'The story goes, he feared no evil. He walked through the valley of the shadow of death on his way north to free soil in Philadelphia. A Baptist minister, he walked with faith in his soul, power and the steps of his feet, to glory. But after the Union won the war, he knew his prayers availed him freedom that was not his alone. And so this righteous man, Richard Coulter returned home, his feet weary, his spirit in no ways tired. 157 years ago, you all know the story but the rest of the world doesn’t and should. In the basement of a Baptist church in Augusta, he and two other ministers, William Jefferson White and Edmund Turney, planted the seeds of something revolutionary, and it was at the time: a school. A school to help formerly-enslaved men entered in the ministry, where education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom. An institution of higher learning that would become Morehouse College.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (02:40)', 'Speech': 'I don’t know any other college in America that has that tradition, that consequence. To the class of 2024, you join, as you know, a sacred tradition. An education makes you free and a Morehouse education makes you fearless. I mean it. Visionary, exceptional. Congratulations. You are Morehouse men. God love you. And again, I thank your families and your friends who helped you get here, because they made sacrifices for you as well.

A day earned, not given.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:31)', 'Speech': 'We gather on this Sunday morning because if we were in church perhaps we would read this reflection. It would be a reflection about resurrection and redemption.

My junior year, spring break, I fell in love at first sight, literally. The woman I adored. I graduated from law school in her hometown and I got married and took a job at a law firm in my hometown, Wilmington, Delaware. But then everything changed.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:59)', 'Speech': 'One of my heroes, and he was my hero, a Baptist minister, a Morehouse man, Dr. Martin Luther King. In April of my law school graduation year, he was murdered, my city of Wilmington, and we were, to our great shame, a slave state and we were segregated. Delaware erupted into flames when he was assassinated, literally. We’re the only city in America where the National Guard patrolled every street corner for nine full months with drawn bayonets. The longest stretch of any American city since the Civil War. Dr. King’s legacy had a profound impact on me and my generation, whether you’re black or white.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (05:46)', 'Speech': 'I left the fancy law firm.

Then we were trying to get someone to run for the United States Senate, the year Nixon ran. I was 29 years of age. I had no notion of running.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (06:22)', 'Speech': 'I loved reading about, everybody knew I was going to run. I didn’t know I was going to run. When a group of senior members of the Democratic Party came to me, they couldn’t find anybody to run and said, “You should run.” Nixon won my state by 60% of the vote. We won by 3,100 votes. We won by the thinnest of margins, but with a broad coalition, including students from the best HBCU in America, Delaware State University. You guys are good but they got me elected.

And poor woman, she just blurted out, she said, “Your wife and daughter are killed.” My 13-year-old daughter. “They’re dead. And your almost three-year-old and four-year-old sons are badly injured.

I know four years ago, as some of your speakers have already mentioned, it felt like one of those Saturdays. The pandemic robbed you of so much.

You’re going to give up.” We have an expression in the Biden family. When you want someone to know, give your word, you say, “Look at me.” He was lying and he said, “Look at me, dad. Look at me.” He said, “Give me your word. Give me your word as my father that you will not quit. That you will stay engaged. Promise me, dad. Stay engaged. Promise me.

The lowest rate in history. Removing every lead pipe in America so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage, and they can’t afford to remove the lead pipes themselves.

Hamas is vicious, attacking Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage.

Innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this. Men, women, and children killed or displaced, in desperate need of water, food, and medicine. It’s a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

It’s about doing what you believe is right even when it’s hard and lonely.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (18:45)', 'Speech': 'You’re all future leaders. Every one of you graduating today, and that’s not hyperbole. You’re future leaders, all of you. You’ll face complicated, tough moments. In these moments, you’ll listen to others but you’ll have to decide guided by knowledge, conviction, principle, and your own moral compass. The desire to know what freedom is, what it can be is the heart and soul of why this college is founded in the first place.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (19:17)', 'Speech': 'Proving that a free nation is born in the hearts of men, spellbound by freedom. That’s the magic of Morehouse. That’s the magic of America. But let’s be clear, what happens to you and your family when old ghosts and new garments seize power? Extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone. Today in Georgia they won’t allow water to be available to you while you wait in line to vote in an election. What in the hell is that all about?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (20:52)', 'Speech': 'Extremists close the doors of opportunity, strike down affirmative action, attack the values of diversity, equality, and inclusion. I never thought, when I was graduating in 1968 as your honoree just was, we talked about, I never thought I’d be a president in a time when there’s a national effort to ban books. Not to write history but to erase history. They don’t see you in the future of America, but they’re wrong. To me we make history, not erase it. We know black history is American history.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (21:31)', 'Speech': 'Many of you graduates don’t know me, but check my records. You’ll know what I’m saying. I mean from my gut. We know black men are going to help lead us to the future. Black men from this class in this university.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:06)', 'Speech': 'Look, you’re doing the work. Today I look out at all you graduates and I see the next generation of Morehouse men who are doctors and researchers curing cancer, artists shaping our culture, fearless journalists and intellectuals challenging convention. I see preachers and advocates who might even join another Morehouse man in the United States Senate. You can clap for him. He’s a good man.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (23:38)', 'Speech': 'So I said I’m proud to have the most diverse administration in history, to tap into the full talents of our nation. I’m also proud to put in the first black woman on the United States Supreme Court.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (24:42)', 'Speech': 'Look, let me close to this: I know I don’t look like I’ve been around very long, but in my career, for the first 30 years I was told, “You’re too young kid.” They used to stop me from getting on the Senate elevator when I first got there, for real. Now I’m too old. Whether you’re young or old, I know what endures. The strength and wisdom of faith endures.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:15)', 'Speech': 'And my hope for you is, my challenge to you is that you can still keep the faith so long as you can. That cap on your head proves you’ve earned your crown. The question is now, 25 years from now, 50 years from now when you’re asked to stand and address the next generation of Morehouse men, what will you say you did with that power you’ve earned? What will you say you’ve done for your family, for your community, your country when it mattered most?'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (25:52)', 'Speech': 'I know what we can do. Together, we’re capable of building a democracy worthy of our dreams. A future where every, even more of your brothers and sisters can follow their dreams. A boundless future where your legacies lift us up to show those who follow a bigger, brighter future that proves the American dream is big enough for everyone to succeed. Class of 2024, four years ago it felt probably like Saturday. Four years later you made it to Sunday, to commencement, to the beginning.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (26:25)', 'Speech': 'And with faith and determination you can push the sun above the horizon once more. You can reveal a light hope, and I’m not kidding, for yourself and for your nation. The prayers of righteous man availeth much. A righteous man, a good man, a Morehouse man. God bless you all. We’re expecting a lot from you. Thank you.'}]"

And I know it’s hard for you too, but we keep fighting because we have no choice but to fight. Jewish leaders are on the front lines fighting anti-Semitism through education, advocacy, and building bridges with other communities. It’s because of your leadership that we will dismantle prejudice and ensure Jewish safety. I also want to acknowledge the student leaders who are here with us today. You have stood up to hate and anti-Semitism on college campuses, and on behalf of our nation, thank you for your courage. And let me be clear, we have your back.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (03:02)', 'Speech': 'Ever since that horrific day of October 7th, I’ve been reaching out to Jewish leaders and Jewish students all across the country, just to check in and see how they’re feeling. And in each of these conversations, my message is always the same. We still need to find and embrace that Jewish joy. Joy is what I remember most about growing up Jewish, and it’s what I felt in some of my favorite moments as Second Gentleman, like returning to my Jewish summer camp and reliving the memory of being voted most athletic, or when I attended…'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (04:42)', 'Speech': 'Last year, before my trip to Poland and Germany to recognize International Holocaust Remembrance Day, President Biden pulled me into the Oval Office. He shared with me his memories of visiting the Dachau concentration camp with his children and grandchildren, and also how angry his father was that the Allies had not bombed the train tracks leading to the concentration camps. Then, in the immediate aftermath of October 7th, I stood beside President Biden as he condemned the pure evil Hamas unleashed into the world and staunchly proclaimed his support for the Jewish people and Israel. He reaffirmed America’s ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, and that hasn’t changed. President Biden and Vice President Harris are steadfast in their support of Israel and the entire Jewish community. Thank you. I’m so grateful for their leadership, especially during these challenging times, so please join me in welcoming President Joe Biden.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:10)', 'Speech': 'One of our nation’s first commitments to freedom of religion was of the Jewish community in Newport, Rhode Island. It goes back a long way. 1790. America was just 14 years old. A local Jewish leader wrote a letter to President George Washington expressing his hope that America would be a nation of religious freedom, not just for Jews, but for all citizens. A nation which “gives bigotry no sanction and persecution no assistance.” That helped lay the groundwork for religious freedom in the First Amendment in our constitution. And ever since, Jews have been in the forefront of helping realize the promise of America for all Americans. Jewish artists, poets helped define the American vision of liberty for millions of people who come to our shores.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (07:58)', 'Speech': 'And look, Jewish suffragettes and advocates have fought for women’s rights, voting rights, every right we have. My whole career, every fight to increase civil rights and civil liberties have been led by the Jewish community where I come. From the Jewish faith leaders and citizen, march, petition, board of [inaudible 00:08:18] demand and civil rights for all. Jewish scientists and engineers and doctors have led breakthroughs and innovation in technology and medicine. Across government, Jewish Americans have proudly served our nation in uniform and in elected and appointed office in embassies, in civil service, and our nation’s highest courts. That’s why Jill and I hosted the first ever High Holiday reception at the White House. That’s important. First ever permanent White House menorah made from the original wood of the White House building, to make clear that the history and vibrancy of the Jewish life is woven into the very fabric of America. And it’s permanent. It’s permanent.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (09:03)', 'Speech': 'But look, I know today’s reception falls on hard times. The trauma of October 7th and its aftermath of the deadliest day the Jewish people have undergone since the Holocaust is still fresh and ongoing with many of you. We have parents of someone being held hostage right now, and we’re going to get them home. We’re going to get them home, come hell or high water. 1200 innocent people slaughtered in their kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, brutally raped, mutilated, sexually assaulted. Hundreds taken hostage and thousands more wounded, carrying the scars in the memory of what they endured. You all know someone directly or indirectly, family, friends, who were stolen from you or are in harm’s way now. And my commitment to safety of the Jewish people, security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. It really is.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:04)', 'Speech': 'My administration is working around the clock to free the remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already. And here with us today is Hirsch Goldberg-Poland. He is not here with us, but he’s still being held by Hamas. And Rachel and John are here with us. Stand up, guys. Their love, strength, and compassion inspired the entire world. And I pledge to both of you, and I mean it. And I know you know, mom, that I mean it, that I will not rest until we bring your loved one home. We got to bring them home. Folks, let me be clear. I’ll always ensure that Israel has everything it needs to defend itself against Hamas and all their enemies, just as I did in Iran’s unprecedented attack last month.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (10:57)', 'Speech': 'We stand with Israel to take out Sinwar and the rest of the butchers of Hamas. We want Hamas defeated. We’ll work with Israel to make that happen. And consistent with Jewish values and compassion, kindness and dignity and human life, my team also is providing critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinian civilians, who are suffering greatly because of the war Hamas has unleashed. It’s heartbreaking. As we do this, we’re also committed to bring the region together, to work toward a two-state solution that provides security, prosperity, and enduring peace for Israel and Palestinians.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (11:36)', 'Speech': 'Let me be clear. We reject the ICC’s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. Whatever these warrants may imply, there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. And it’s clear Israel wants to do all it can to ensure civilian protection. But let me be clear, contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what’s happening is not genocide. We reject that. We’ll always stand with Israel and the threats against its security. Compounding the pain is a vicious surge of anti-Semites around the world here in America as well, in our streets, our social media and college campuses. It’s amazing it’s happening. It’s absolutely despicable. It’s wrong and it must stop. It must stop. In America, we respect and protect fundamental rights of free speech to protest peacefully. That’s America. But there’s no place in any campus in America, any place in America for anti-Semitism, for hate speech that threatens violence of any kind, against Jews or anyone else.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (12:49)', 'Speech': 'Nobody should fear going to synagogue or school or walking down the street wearing a symbol of your faith. That’s wrong. Simply wrong. And that’s why long before October 7th, I launched the nation’s first national strategy to counter anti-Semitism. It’s mobilizing the full force of the federal government to crack down on anti-Semitism wherever you find it. We recently secured an additional $400 million, the largest increase ever in physical security for nonprofits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, Jewish nonprofits. My Department of Education has put colleges on notice that anti-Semitism is discrimination prohibited under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, period. And the Department has to investigate discrimination aggressively. That’s my Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. Deborah. Is Deborah here? Deborah, thank you, Lipstadt, for furthering our efforts to all around the world. It matters. This matters. To the Jewish community, I want you to know I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. And let me assure you, as your president, you are not alone. You belong. You always will belong.'}, {'Time': 'Joe Biden (14:14)', 'Speech': 'Let me close with this. In moments like this, we do well to remember that this ancient story of Jewish resilience endures because of its people. That’s what today’s all about, feeling the joy and pride of community, honoring the beauty of your unshakable faith, and celebrating the heritage and legacy of Jewish Americans who continue to enrich every single part of our life. So thank you for what you’ve done for America and for the whole world to make it a better place. May the Jewish people shine their light, and shine the light on the world for generations to come because we need you badly. But God bless you all and God protect our troops. Thank you for being there.'}]"
